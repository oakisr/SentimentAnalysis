It's drag-and-drop for most purposes--drag your video clips in in order, trim them, then drag in overlays, special effects, transitions, and titles. To alter something, like the titles, just double-click. It's really that easy.

On TV, Rosetta Stone promises users of its products that they will be comfortable with any of their language courses in short order, citing their use by the US State Department, the US Army and others.\n\nWell, time to give it a try. The yellow box's contents were a User's Guide, the usual assortment of user agreements, registration cards, a Quick Start guide, a small pamphlet on setting up the included USB headset on one's computer and of course, the software DVDs (one application disk and three language disks, one each for French levels 1, 2, and 3) along with Audio Companion CDs that serve as a complement to the software course--supposedly, these will help you practice what you've learned in the software and is meant to be played on a CD player or downloaded (as they put it) to an MP3 player.\n\nIn itself, impressive set if a little overwhelming, but I found the instructions rather straightforward and easy-to-use. Just following the instructions in the Quick Start guide was enough to have me operational on my within the hour. The headset installation instructions were equally as easy to follow on my Vista PC and there's even a French QWERTY keyboard overlay. The folks at Rosetta Stone have outdone themselves in this regard. There are far too many instances of software installation and use that get in the way of the software itself.\n\nSo, how did I find the software and did I learn some French? I admit freely that I was a bit skeptical about the company's claims. No grammar workbooks or textbooks, just what they call a \"natural\" way of learning through something called Dynamic Immersion, which sounds like being kicked off the side of the pool into the deep end, only less pleasant! Their admonition is to simply trust the method as it works without requiring translation. They promise that I will be speaking French immediately from the first lesson and that was no joke.\n\nThe levels are broken into units which are further subdivided into core lessons, focused activities and finally, a milestone. The program starts with a few questions about the user's goals which can revolve around both speaking and writing the language, just writing or just speaking. The recommended default is to focus on both speaking and writing, which is what I chose.\n\nFrom the \"home\" screen, the user can see their progress along the lesson, the unit and the entire course. It's truly easy to use. The content is also incredible: you will either type responses, listening to and repeating after a speaker (which is scored as well) or choosing the correct answers from multiple-choices or typing out the proper sentence. In so doing, you find yourself picking up on vocabulary, proper pronunciation, writing and grammatical structure.\n\nI have finished the first level and I'm looking forward to the second level as it is easy, but hard work if that makes sense. I haven't yet listened to the audio CDs, but if the software is anything to go by, my god. I am so impressed with the quality of the software and instruction that I am giving Rosetta Stone French the highest recommendations.

I found it a little clunky, but it was usable. I was sad I got plus because I didn't realize there was a higher ultimate version and there was no way to upgrade. So this time I'm glad to be getting ultimate.\n\nThings that are new for 19:\n-Project Bins--a bin that you can throw a bunch of video/sound that you want to use, or a way to put video/sound into a organized bins without having to move the videos from the folders they really are located in. The bins contain video links, not the actual videos. This is great for me. I like having my videos organized by time and events. Also I have tons of videos and pictures in one folder. This allows me to grab the best and bin them without creating duplicate video folders and taking up more space. It helps me not to have to go through a folder with hundreds of pictures/videos over and over again. I love this feature! (And they needed to add it since Adobe Elements 13 added it)\n-Even more effects--like I didn't waste enough time already over effecting my home videos... Thankfully there's now a favorite section so you can put your favorite effects where you can easily get to them.\n-Multicam support--If you have a party or wedding or wherever you might have more than one people videoing, it's pretty cool to be able to jump around the cams. If you have audio for your videos, it even tries to line them up automatically!\n-Support for more file types and better 4k support.\n\nWhen you open it up, it looks very similar to 17 or 18. It's an evolution and refinement with more features. It's good to know they didn't change everything! It's run pretty smoothly so far, but I have a pretty powerful computer. I don't have anything higher than 1080p to play with, but I've not had issues. I do suggest you use the system requirements as a very minimum requirement. I wouldn't try running this on anything less than an i5 with 8GB of ram and would prefer to have an actual video card in there too--and that may still give you a lot of waiting when crunching higher res video. I wish Pinnacle would give you a suggested computer setup for different levels of performance. I'm running it on an XEON 1650v3 with an NVIDIA Quadro K2200 and 16GB of ram. That's basically the equivalent of a high end i7 and a GTX 750. You're going to have a completely different experience running this on your $400 laptop than a performance machine. Video editing takes a lot more processing than picture editing.\n\nBut I was able to trim, split, combine single and multiple HD videos with no issues. I could have saved in many formats and DVD. It does bluray with an additional purchase. But, disk based media is practically dead. I'm just glad it lets me save it as a mp4. It will also export to Facebook, Youtube, and Vimeo.\n\nMy understanding is that Pinnacle provides little if any support. And I think that's the main disadvantage over Adobe Premier Elements. I can google all sorts of issues with Adobe Premier Elements and find all kind of help. It may be slow support with a strong accent, but I can call Adobe. Pinnacle Studio does have tutorial videos on their site and on Youtube. It looks like more videos for 19 are coming and most of the 18 videos do apply. There is a knowledge base in the support section and the ability to email support (free for 15 days from purchase...). If it works great, you're good. If it doesn't work for you or you have problems with the program--good luck...\n\nBut for me it's been working great. It hasn't crashed once. The way it works makes sense to me. If you're still deciding, go to youtube and search for \"Pinnacle Studio 19 Ultimate - Basic Editing Beginners Tutorial\". That will give you an idea of how the program works.

It doesn't even swap well between its own features.\n\nBut that's enough complaining about the slowness - - how well does it let you manipulate sounds, pictures, and so on?  To test this, I set myself two simple tasks: to set a slideshow to music, and to create a panorama out of several photos.  The slideshow task was simple and menu-driven, and easy to do.  The software imported the pictures and the music very slowly, and the project was slow to save, but it looked very nice when all done.  However, I could have done the same thing in PowerPoint.\n\nThe second task also worked well, and was much more impressive.  I had four pictures of a dune that I wanted to piece together.  I had not originally taken them as a panorama, so the pictures had somewhat different focal lengths and exposures.  Some overlapped a little, others a lot.  The software has an automatic panorama tool that fit three of the four pictures together well.  It was a little off on the last seam, but a \"fine tune\" tool allowed me to get it closer manually, and then the software finished the seam off.  Some seams were easy, requiring only that the software identify \"dune,\" \"water,\" and \"sky.\"  However, I was particularly impressed by the more difficult seams, which required getting brown grass stitched together right, as well as an area of leafy shrubs.  Very impressive.\n\nThe software also uses irregular stitches, so that there isn't a hard line between pictures.  One of those seams more or less disappeared, and the others look OK, given the poor raw material that I gave the program.\n\nYet again, simple tasks were slow.  It took me five minutes to save the panorama and then open it in the photo editor.  The photo editor was also very intuitive and easy to use, and I was able to fiddle with the brightness and contrast of the resulting panorama.  Those tasks, too, were slow to load, but sped up with use (presumably because of caching).  Save times got down to 30-35 seconds, which is OK but slower than other software I've used.\n\nAll in all: I'm impressed by what it can do, and how well it can do it, but it's frustratingly slow.

For this, it has been a delightful tool.\n\nI used to have the ArtZII pen and graphics tablet, but due to some awful driver issues, it suddenly\nstopped working with Windows XP.  That meant that the Painter X that I had purchased was pretty much\nuseless to me and I never got to explore the program.  I could not afford another pen and using a mouse\nwas far too frustrating.\n\nThe old Painter was nice.  It gave the idea of doing artwork on the computer, but there was still a gap\nbetween real time artist tools and what was in the program.  Still it was useful and I used it constantly\nuntil my Wacom graphics tablet stopped working.\n\nEXPERIENCE OF PAINTER X3\n\nSince it has been some years since I have had the chance to use Painter, I have forgotten all of the wonderful\nthings it can do.\n\nI now have the Intuos 5 Touch Graphic Tablet (Medium) from Wacom and let me tell you this program is so overwhelming\nI feel as if I might drown there is so much in it.\n\nWhen you first enter the program, there is an opportunity to get some training on using Painter X3.\nYou can opt into the training from the initial screen.  This will give you an option to go to the extensive\nhelp files or go online to learn how to use Painter X3 for whatever your penchant is.\n\nThere are tutorials for Fine Arts, Illustrating, Photo Art, and Painter Interface.  Beyond that, there are\ntutorials for doing specific art pieces provided by a variety of artists.  Some are for previous versions of\nPainter, but they still apply.\n\nHOW THE PROGRAM INTERACTS WITH INTUOUS 5\n\nI am a bit overwhelmed with this program.  Not only am I dealing with all of the amazing improvements of the program\nsince I used to use it constantly, but the Intuos 5 is another whole breed of graphics pads.  Painter is designed\nto work with the Intuos 5 graphics tablet, so you can do just about anything with it.\n\nI love that when I am working with the pad you can zoom in or out just by using your fingers to expand or contract\nthe paper.  This can be turned off, incidentally.  You can turn the paper to just about any angle you like with your\nfingers as well so the art creation experience is much more realistic.\n\nThere is a seemingly endless series of brush strokes and nuances that this pen and tablet capture that are very close\nto duplicating the real life art experience.  There is the ability to take a thick line and draw it down to almost imperceptible\nline that fades to a point just like in real life.\n\nThe new jitter brush enhancement to this program is delightful.  It more closely duplicates the way that paint or other media will\nnot be uniform no matter how much you have a steady hand.\n\nSOME NEW THINGS THAT IMPRESS ME\n\nThe Jitter brush is one of the new features, and there is a brush search.  You can search based upon what you want- if you want only brushes that will jitter, then you can narrow it down by that.  I have not had any problems with this feature yet, but as I continue to use it over time, I will update.\n\nThere is a way to view an inspirational reference image while you keep focus on your current work. You can independently change the view of the docked panel without changing your work space or changing focus from it.\n\nYou can also control the minimum values of brushes like size or opacity.  Also, you have some bit of control of the settings of the jitter brushes.  I have not had a huge amount of interaction with this to find the bugs yet, but it sure is interesting to mess with.\n\nPerspective guides are amazing to me- they are lines that appear so you can use them as guides when putting perspective in your painting or work.\n\nThere is also an ability to go back and forth between a clone image- you can apply some changes to the original piece that you are cloning as well as the work you are cloning to- going back and forth between them.\n\nI have not been able to truly explore the layer application but now you can apply changes to layers simultaneously.  The small projects I tested it on worked well- again I have not come across bugs yet.\n\nFINAL COMMENTS\n\nI have to say that this Painter X3 release is so packed full of goodies that I can not even begin to rave as much as I want to in this limited space.  Using it with the Intuos graphics pad makes it so delightful that I am like a kid in a candy store with unlimited budget!\n\nThere are some frustrations with the Intuos- using this sometimes is a bit frustrating- the paper will go a bit too far left or right, or become too small or big and I have to mess with it, but I am not sure if this is the software in Painter, the Intuos 5 physically, or a combination of both.\n\nThere is so much in this program that I want to comment on but I will update this review as I have the chance to explore it more in depth.  I am truly impressed with it so far.  I am not naive, however.  Programs will have bugs or limitations in them and it is just a matter of time before I encounter one.  However, at this time, it is pretty solid in performance and I love using it.\n\nWHO WOULD LIKE THIS PROGRAM?\n\n--If you are a graphic artist who tends to want to do more ornate graphics, backgrounds or illustrations, you would most likely like this program.\n\n--If you are a fine artist who wants to test out designs before you paint them, you will definitely like this.\n\n--If you are a photo person who likes to dress up photos in a more artistic way, you will like this.\n\n--If you have access to a decent computer with the ability to get a graphics pad, you will probably like this, especially if it is the Wacom Intuos 5\n\nWHO WOULD PROBABLY NOT LIKE THIS?\n\n--If you have an older computer and graphics pad, you might not like this.  It takes some power to use. (Go bigger than minimum system requirements)\n\n--If you are a dabbler, you will probably not like this program.  They do have a lighter version that might be better\n\n--If you the type of person who has to feel the texture of the paper below your hand and experience the smells and performance of real media, you probably won't like this program.  Many of the artists I tried to talk into trying it, refuse for those reasons.\n\nAll in all, at this time, I highly recommend this program to any artist who loves the arts, anything that is geared toward working with natural media (pen and ink, spraying, painting, markers, watercolor, etc).  If you are delighted at being creative this program will give you more than you will probably ever use, but you will have a lot of freedom to create.\n\nAgain, I will update this review as I discover more about this delightfully overwhelming program.", "summary": "In Depth Review From A Fine Arts Perspective", "unixReviewTime": 1379980800}

Of course I would be over-stating my claim if I said that there wasn't anything beneficial in there, but those two features alone when it is subtitled as contracts and forms was a bit of a disappointment to say the least.\nI wound up buying the book Deduct It as a separate book which was the latest version.

AVG's \"Anti-Virus & Anti-Spyware\" is basically a step up from the freeware that I have been using for several years on one of my PCs. The two year subscription is a big plus, hopefully it will keep me worry free.\n\nThe program installed without issue once I put the disc in my drive, entered the license information and waited about five minutes for the process to finish. I rebooted my machine, registered my copy and everything appeared to be working fine. The program updated the virus and spyware definitions to the latest available versions, then the program said that there was a newer version of the program available for download. Apparently the disc has version 8. X on it, and there is version 9. X out on the upgrade server. That's great, but why didn't it tell me that before I wasted my time installing from the disc? This is one thing that Kaspersky informs you of, and seems like a logical place to have up front. So I downloaded the newest version, which seemed to take a long time. I don't remember how many megabytes it was but I don't think it was a big file, yet took awhile to acquire.\n\nOnce the upgraded version of AVG's Anti-Virus and Anti-Spyware was installed, I rebooted the computer only to find that the Anti Virus engine failed to initialize. Windows Security Center informed me that the anti virus software was turned off, and when I opened the AVG control panel it was confirmed. The antivirus component, as well as several other components were not active. I decided another reboot was in order, but when the computer came back up it was the same scenario, it was still not active. No matter how many times I rebooted the machine I could not get the modules to get to their active state so I figured something must have gone wrong during the install. I decided to uninstall the software and try again, hoping that this time it will load properly.\n\nIt took two attempts after the initial install of the upgraded version of AVG Anti Virus & Anti Spyware and about two hours to be successful. Finally the program loaded with active components and theoretically was doing its thing. That's where this review gets difficult as far as the functionality of this software, since unless you get hit by a virus or spyware you don't really know if the program is working OR if the virus or spyware is not detected by the software you don't know that it has failed.\n\nAs far as the user interface on AVG's Antivirus & Antispyware, it is similar to other programs, showing each component and its status, then getting more detailed if you click on the icon. It contains the following: Antivirus, Antispyware, LinkScanner, Anti Rootkit, Email Scanner, Web Shield, Resident Shield, Update Manager, and License. What you do not get in this version of the software is a Firewall and Identification Protection. For that you will have to get the Internet Security product. Off to the left side of the interface there is the computer scanner button, which allows you to manually scan your whole computer, scan specific files or folders, and an anti rootkit scan. You can also manage scheduled scans, allowing you to plan when you want scans to occur (assuming you leave your computer on during those times).\n\nSo far, the software has not indicated that I have had any threats to my system since it has been installed. Like I mentioned early that could be a good thing or a bad thing. Subsequent scans have also indicated that the computer is clean. I am hoping that AVG's Anti-Virus & Anti Spyware is doing its job since you really don't know it's there except for the icon in the system tray, when it is performing an update, when it scans an email you are sending or receiving, or it lets you know you are visiting a safe website. It does not noticeably slow your computer down, but you know it is running in the background and you hope it catches a threat before it is too late. I just hope it never has to.\n\nI am giving it three stars because of the initial install issues, not because of the performance or user interface.", "summary": "I had a little trouble after the update, but now it's working!", "unixReviewTime": 1262304000}

I ordered this software to specifically use in my home theater setup that includes a 65\" Panasonic Plasma, Denon AV receiver, a WDTV Live Hub, PS3, and a networked PC running a raid array containing my DVD/video library, music, pictures and the like. This is my first interaction with PowerDVD since the early 2000's when it came pre-loaded on my Compaq desktop. Clearly Cyberlink's intention is to make PowerDVD the centerpiece of your home theater experience. This software is complete overkill if you're just looking to playback Blu-ray's, DVD's and do some streaming on a laptop and is really geared toward the serious home theater owner.\n\n--------------------\nSETUP:\n\nInstalling the software on my Windows 7 desktop is about as easy as it gets and is standard fare. Pop in the disc, follow the on-screen guide and finally use the included product code to register the software with Cyberlink. To their credit Cyberlink actually included a full manual in the box with their software which is something that is becoming increasingly rare with software. This makes looking up features, answering the, \"what does this button do?\" questions very easy. After setup and launching the software it performed a quick scan of my hard drives and indexed my media files as well as presenting a number of video tutorials about the software.\n\n--------------------\nFEATURES:\n\nOh boy, there's a lot to cover here!\n\nFirst, I suppose is the myriad of supported movie formats including: BD-R (various specs), BDROM Profile 2.0 (BD-Live), BDROM Profile 5.0 (BD-3D), AVCREC, AVCHD, DVD-Video, DVD-VR, DVD+VR, VCPS, VCD, SVCD, CD. There are even more supported video formats (I'll list some of the more popular one's only): AVC, AVI, DIVX, H264, MKV, MOV, MP4, MP4V, MPE, MPEG, MPG, TIVO, WM, WMV. Music formats include: AAC, AC3, ADTS, APE, AOB, DTS, FLAC, M4A, MID, MKA, MP2, MP3, MPA, OGG, RMI, WAV, WMA\n\nFor a full listing of supported formats (movies, video, music & pictures): [...]\n\nTrueTheater HD:\nCyberlink touts this as their DVD upscaling and Blu-ray enhancing software. I've used various upscaling DVD players over the years and the effect here is similar. Don't expect Blu-ray quality out of TrueTheater and honestly I'm okay with regular DVD 480p quality for my older movies.\n\nTrueTheater:\nPowerDVD features a variety of other enhancement features like TrueTheater Motion that tries to smooth video by enhancing the frame rate. TrueTheater Stretch that stretches a 4:3 frame to 16:9. TrueTheater Denoise & Stabilizer that are geared toward home movie takers. In short a lot of features that you may never use unless you are really, really into tinkering with video quality and getting the absolute most out of your videos and movies.\n\nFor my uses I focused more on the ability to playback Blu-ray discs, video files on an internal raid and external NAS. With these functions PowerDVD performs fantastically.\n\n--------------------\nPOTENTIAL BLOAT:\n\nThere is a lot to this software. So much \"extra\" stuff that I'm tempted to call it bloat. YouTube, Flickr and the now standard Facebook plug-in are alive and present here. I have no interest in connecting to Facebook on my home theater as I already have a myriad of devices that do the job better. The YouTube integration is admirable but still works better from a browser. Flickr is the interesting feature in the chance that you store a lot of photos on that site and like to view them on your PC/home theater.\n\nI also did not utilize the 3D or the 3D conversion of 2D content features as it's not something that's appealing to me. Similarly I did not try out the 4K features as I don't have compatible content.\n\nCyberlink also offers apps for Android & iTunes compatible devices that allow you to stream content and have basic remote control functions. Again a feature that I didn't use because of redundancy with apps/programs that are already in place in my home.\n\n--------------------\nClosing:\n\nPowerDVD is really geared toward someone looking for an all-in-one solution and doesn't want to bounce around from different media players for different content. For folks who already have established processes and software that you use and are familiar with PowerDVD will offer less value and thus be a harder buy at its premium price.", "summary": "Expensive for What it Does", "unixReviewTime": 1377129600}

I was planning to switch to a Mac in November after OSX 10.5 was released.  I planned to switch for two reasons:\n\n1.  Clean design - eliminate a lot of cables.\n\n2.  Imovie - I currently do quite a bit of video editing for my church on my Dell 4600 using Pinnacle Studio 9.35.  Pinnacle Studio's interface essentially is a knock off of the old imovie 6.  Very easy to use.  However, Pinnacle is buggy and unreliable!\n\nImovie 6 is about 80% as powerful as Pinnacle Studio. Unfortunately, I wrongly assumed that the next edition of Imovie would be more powerful than Imovie 6.  Therefore, I have been waiting for over six months for the new Imovie to be released before I purchased a new Imac extreme edition.  Now I see that one of the major reasons for purchasing a new Imac has been removed.\n\nFinal Cut Express to me is a difficult and frustrating product to use.  (No automatic segmentation of imported video clips, no storyboard mode.)  If I am stuck with Final Cut Express I might as well keep my PC and buy Sony Vegas.  (It does not have a storyboard mode but at least it does segment video clips).\n\nI sincerely hope that Apple reconsiders Imovie 08 and releases a true competitor to Pinnacle Studio or Sony Vegas Movie Studio Platinum.  As of right now the PC has the lead in mid level video editors when it comes to ease of use.  This should not be!\n\nI don't think that Apple understands what a selling point Imovie was.  I have had several clients buy Macs in the last year and almost all of them wanted to play with Imovie.  These clients are not sophisticated users, yet they figured out Imovie in a matter of minutes and have been producing nice movies now for several months.  They have been eagerly awaiting the new Imovie because they were looking for more features.  Sadly they will be disappointed.  Some may be forced to run Pinnacle  Studio within bootcamp.

Check the individual product prices to confirm, as pricing changes continuously.  There are several new features in QB 2014 that I think are great (below), and some issues that have been frustrating for years and continue to be so.  This review is of R3.  Subsequent (free) updates of QB Pro 2014 may introduce new features or address some of the issues below.\n\nFor new users, there is an improved set-up interface - although, as always, I recommend those not familiar with bookkeeping to consult with someone to help them fine-tune the chart of accounts that will be created for your new company.\n\nLots of new features that I find really useful.  Because I typically send invoices by email, the new features in 2014 make it worth the cost of the upgrade from 2013 for me.  If you're on 2013 the new features may or may not be worth it for you.  (If you are upgrading from 2012 or earlier, I think the combination of new features in 2013 and 2014 make the upgrade worth it for almost anyone who spends much time each week in Quickbooks.)\n\nWhen you email a form, such as an Invoice, you can add multiple attachments to it - for example, receipts that support reimbursable expenses.  Emailed forms are logged in the Customer Center for each customer, so you have a record of what you sent and when (although you cannot retrieve the original email content... so best to BCC yourself if you want a full record).\n\nYou can now have multiple, customizable email 'boilerplates' for different forms! - customized in Preferences > Send Forms > Company Preferences.  When you go to email an Invoice, e.g., you can select which email content template to use from a drop-down... and can further edit and spellcheck the message right there.\n\nThe new Income Tracker is great, providing a clean screen to show unpaid invoices and more.  It provides better information than the old Collections Center and is more convenient than generating an aged receivables report.  This new Income Tracker appears in the entire Quickbooks product line in 2014 - all versions of QB Windows as well as QB Mac and QB Online.  The Windows Income Tracker does NOT show unbilled time and costs, something that QB Mac shows in its Tracker... so you still need to generate a report to see what billables have not yet been invoiced.\n\nThe Customer Center now has separate tabs for at-glance-viewing and filtering of customer:  Transactions, Contacts, To Do's, Notes and Sent Emails.\n\nWhen you attach a file to a transaction, instead of the paper clip just changing colors as in the past, there is a red bubble next to it listing the number of attached files - similar to the bubble listing unread messages in an email program.  This same interface shows up at the top right of the screen by the new Reminder and Alert icons, making it harder to miss reminders/alerts that you created or which are from Intuit (notice of an update, or a payroll deadline, for example).\n\nThe new My Company page lists not just your company legal info, but also your product info and a list of all Intuit services to which you're subscribed  - as well as other services that you might want to utilize.  Clicking the icon for your subscribed service (e.g., Payroll, Intuit Payment Network, Credit Card Processing) - takes you to the web page for managing that service.\n\nThe new tabbed Employee/Payroll center puts employee information and transactions as well as all payroll processing in one convenient screen.  When in the Payroll Center, you have tabs for Pay Employees, Pay Liabilities and File Forms - cleanly separating those tasks vs earlier versions - but equally useful are the new links at the bottom of each of those screens:  PDF Quick Guides to explain the processes, Other Activities and Reports links that are customized for the particular payroll activity.  Payroll schedules are easily visible and managed to allow regular payroll processing without having to process employees one by one.\n\nPayroll subscription:  The bundled 1 year subscription to Enhanced Payroll supports only 1 employee out of the box.  Additional employees are stated as $2/month.  I've mostly used the cheaper Basic Payroll over the years.  The main difference with Enhanced is that it can (1) electronically pay your payroll taxes, (2) file federal and some state tax forms, and (3) print W-2's that are ready to file.  Without Enhanced payroll, you can pay electronically via EFTPS and your state web payment system - but have to transcribe the numbers and do all of the log-in steps yourself, you can file most forms online including W-2's that can be prepared at the SSS.gov web site - but again, requiring manual transcription.  Enhanced payroll saves these extra, manual steps - and avoid the typos you might make during any of them.  I'm a little confused about the advertised claim that direct deposit is free, as I'm told that it will cost $1.45 per paycheck when I go to the \"Set Up Direct Deposit\" page.\n\nIntuit's requirement that you must phone them to activate your payroll subscription is aggravatingly frustrating and so last-century.  Look, Intuit:  we have a valid license key, we've registered it to our valid Intuit account... let us move on with life without having to be on hold for a human who types in things we could have done ourselves.  Equally aggravating is that Intuit sets your payroll service up for auto-renewal - they do not give you an option to 'opt out'.  I typically buy my annual payroll subscription from Amazon or a big box outlet for half of what Intuit wants to receive for an auto-renewal.  It's a huge waste of cardboard and shipping (overall) as the only thing in the box is a code... which then has to be given to that Intuit service rep on the phone to get another code to actually activate the subscription.  I absolutely loath having to set up or renew payroll with Intuit because of this arcane process.\n\nGlitches that never seem to get fixed still exist.  Quickbooks integrates with Intuit Payment Network to allow you to receive invoice payments by e-check or credit card, but the transaction download process will not let you choose the account used for the fees - instead creating an IPN Fees top-level account and forcing you to edit transactions to put the fees in the account / sub-account that you want them to be in for proper aggregation of banking fees on your income statement.\n\nAddress fields in forms are too narrow to display full name and address information - even though there is lots of blank screen space to the right of the fields.  For multicurrency, the currency fields are too small to display the full amounts of low-denomination foreign currencies - although, again, there is plenty of room for them to make the field big enough on-screen.  The Help windows are tiny, un-resizable windows, forcing the user to scroll a great deal and manually close the windows.  Printer Setup for each type of form continues to be in the File menu, as it has been forever ... meaning that when you go to print a pay check, you may have no idea what printer or printer settings will be used and cannot adjust them at the time of printing... but rather have to exit, go back to the File menu to verify or set up printing for that form, and then start over again.\n\nSystem Requirements:  The product page and box do not include Windows XP SP3... primarily because Microsoft will stop supporting XP early in 2014, but Quickbooks Windows will run on XP SP3, at least today.  The official requirements are for Vista or newer.", "summary": "Quickbooks keeps getting better, yet old issues remain unfixed", "unixReviewTime": 1383955200}

I tend to be cut, edit, trim, title and render. I used to be much more creative. But these creative options make all the difference. From the very simple editable intros with stock music.

My basic numbers calculations have been done in programs like Quicken and the analog pen and paper method. I think in the past I may have opened up Excel or tried to use Apple's AppleWorks spreadsheet program, but not only did the programs look boring, but I had no idea where to begin in using these applications.\n\nLeave it to Apple, however, to create yet another useful production program for the rest of us. That is, a program which is intuitive, practical, and stylish. Numbers '08 is another fine program that can help you transform the analog fashion of pen and paper calculations and create functions that can help you become more efficient with various projects involving money, data gathering and calculations.\n\nAlready I see a number of projects that I can create or improve upon using Numbers '08. For example, for the last couple of years I've been keeping a simple photography equipment inventory list in my business binder. When I make a new $[...]+ purchase I make note of it in my list. But with Numbers '08, I can streamline that data and keep a running balance on how much I've spent on equipment. Likewise, I can use the same technique for creating a better marketing plan, an equipment needs budget, a business growth plan, a couple of simple to-do check lists for long terms projects, and a few custom invoices for freelance work I do. In fact, I've already re-designed my wedding client contract using Numbers '08 so that I can use it on my laptop and fill it in right after the close of a sale. This type spread sheet method is more accurate and less time consuming than the paper format.\n\nThe templates that come installed with Numbers '08 provide a list of other possibilities that include various financial budgets plans, a home improvement plan, an event planner, grade book, and a science research report.\n\nAs with Apple's Pages and Keynote, Numbers '08 is also a graphic design application. It contains tools for adding various font styles, shapes, photos, and other media. In other words, you have the ability to tell a visual story with your facts, figures, and data.\n\nIf you have no prior experience with spread sheet creation or if you want to learn the features of Numbers '08, Apple has produced an excellent set of tutorial videos to get you up and running. The 286-page Numbers User Guide is also another useful source for getting started and learning the program.\n\nThe most challenging part for those of us new to spreadsheet development is understanding how formulas work in a table setup so that calculations can be made. Numbers '08 comes installed with over 150 formulas that will perform most all the calculations that we'll ever need. But the basic mathematical functions that you learned in high school should be enough to get your started. Basically, a formula simply provides the sum of selected cells in a table. Again, the Apple tutorial or User Guide and the installed templates will show you some really easy steps for basic functions. From there, you can study and create formula functions to fit your individual needs.\n\nAlready a third-party website called Numbers Templates has been created to share templates, tips, and tricks for using the Numbers '08 spreadsheet program.\n\nThough I can't compare Numbers '08 with the industry standard program like Excel, Apple's program I think will fit the needs of most home and small business users. No doubt, future versions will include even more advance functions, but as with Apple's other fine programs, Numbers '08 has the simplicity and style that we've all come to expect.\n\nOriginal posted at [...]", "summary": "Numbers 08 - Spreadsheets for the Rest of Us by Bakari Chavanu", "unixReviewTime": 1190073600}

Nolo makes (made) some valuable applications but they tend to look like something you would find in MSDOS 3.0.  Quicken, on the other hand has a very slick and easy to understand user interface.\n\nWillMaker Plus is very much a Nolo product. Although it contains the basic forms you buy it for, the user interface is so basic it looks like something you would find on PC's from the 1980's.  The willmaking app (the part that most people buy this for) consists of 7 questions.  Seriously, that's it. You are allowed to enter only what the software will let you enter and there are some really basic non-interactive guidelines that are at the same time too basic and also too confusing.\n\nI wrote my own will in about 10 minutes, but the software didn't permit me to include ANY specific details for someone to know what my \"final intentions\" are. I can't imagine anyone having such a basic lifestyle as to just say \"give it all to so-and-so\".  I think anyone could just hand-write that sort of thing on a piece of paper and hand it to their next of kin.  I expected the software to be more like TurboTax in that it would interview me about what the provisions of my mortgage are, what and where my investments are, what and where my life insurance policies are, what I owe and how to pay that off, what special provisions I may have for friends who are not in my will but who I may want to leave certain things that they've admired to.  But no.  None of the above.  Just 7 questions and a print-out of something that to me really has no practical value.\n\nI think Quicken is doing themselves a disservice to put their name on this product. It's not worth the 35 bucks and especially not worth the \"list price\" of 70. There are hundreds of websites you can go to and download a simple will form that will be just as useful to you as WillMaker Plus.  The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is that it does give you the convenience of having some basic forms all on one disk, a bit of a timesaver.\n\nBy the way, if you buy this toward the end of 2011, note that the \"free updates\" are only good through the end of December.", "summary": "Not very sophisticated", "unixReviewTime": 1312070400}

First of all, you get four separate programs, each with its own installation disc.  That you means you do four separate installs and have to type in four separate very long serial numbers.  In the Photo Album 7 alone, the program was a separate install from the clip art and the user guide, so if you want those, add two more installs to that list (although without 2 more serial numbers).  That annoyed me right in the beginning.  Then, the programs are very light on functionality and limited in options.  The photo program offers no more than I get with the free program that came with my Canon camera, and if I want more functions than that, it tells me I have to buy and install yet another program, Paint Shop Pro Photo.  I was very unimpressed.  The one capability it had that was value-added for me was the ability to burn a disc of your photos; my other photo program doesn't have that.  The paint-it program turns your photo into a painting-like image, which I can see would produce interesting images if you wanted a stylized version of your photos.  I rarely want that; I really want to see my photo in all of its glorious detail.  I already have scrapbooking programs that are more functional than the one that came with this set, which is a little bit tedious and annoying to use.  I selected the \"Hip to Be Square\" layout and tried to drag photos to the large boxes in the center of the page, but I was not allowed to do that; you can only drag a photo to the boxes labeled \"Drag photo here.\"  This is pretty restrictive in terms of the creativity you're allowed.  The panorama plus is a nice and rather useful program if you don't have a camera that already lets you stitch images together.\n\nOverall, I just felt that I would rather have just one program with all of these functions integrated into it, and I would like much more functionality than these provided.  They could keep the nice user interface and the simplicity and just beef up the functionality without making you buy more programs.  Of the four programs, the one I would most like to see enhanced for more functionality would be the photo program.  I thought I was going to be able to correct my photos much more extensively than this program allows.  On the other hand, if you are a beginning computer user with no existing software that does any of these things, this might be a good choice for you, because the programs are not difficult to use and provide basic functionality.", "summary": "Not so much", "unixReviewTime": 1325462400}

Granted, $30 for the 2012 version is a pretty cheap investment to get started, but anyone can get a 2-week or 30-day free trial on Ancestry (you don't need the software) and they have a free online tree-builder feature that is simple & straightforward.\n\n4) If you want help building your family tree and internet research or software programs aren't your thing, please remember the LDS (Mormon) church offers free genealogical services to the public. If you just want to chart out your tree on old-fashioned graph paper, for example, you can accomplish this free via email, phone, or visiting a Mormon genealogy center.\n\nThey will *not* try to convert you - these offices are very PR-friendly (though they may give your deceased family members one of their controversial posthumous baptism ceremonies). A central tenant of this denomination is knowing your family tree, so devotees can track down ancestors after the 2nd coming. They are therefore happy to help non-members in genealogical tasks.

It's also pretty.\n\nNow for the not so wonderful stuff. The Windows 10 \"Start\" menu is more like the one in Windows 8.1 (awful) than in Windows XP (terrific). It certainly is no improvement over Windows 7, which was barely useable and very ugly.\n\nI upgraded my slightly over one-year-old system to Windows 10 pro. Over half of my software did not make it into the Start menu in the process. The programs that did migrate from Windows 7 were not organized as in my Windows 7 setup, and did not include other programs and utilities contained in the same folders. Thus, when clicking \"all apps,\" I inevitably found many programs missing. Worse, the \"all apps\" section of the Start menu cannot be modified or edited -- except to uninstall programs which did make it to the list. You can remove, but not add back the missing stuff.\n\nMicrosoft is obsessed with the \"tiles\" feature of the Startup menu. Yes, tiles are still with us. Ironically, unlike the \"all apps\" selection, this least liked feature of Windows 8 and 8.1 can be edited and modified in Windows 10, and programs missing from the \"all apps\" list can be migrated to tiles (the missing programs are somewhat buried in Windows 10, and sheer persistence is needed to reveal their location -- not in a place available for everyday use, but inserted so it seems as an afterthought to let you know they were not forgotten.).  Dumb! Dumb! Dumb!\n\nEdge (Microsoft's new Internet Explorer) is not even fully functional. It cannot accept add-ons, plug-ins or other essential accessories to make the browser useable. Microsoft promises this capacity will be forthcoming.\n\nStill, only one of my programs that is available after the transfer did not survive the changeover from Win 7 to Win 10 -- Norton Internet Security (NIS). Almost immediately after booting up, I received notification that a new version of NIS was available and that it would be necessary to uninstall the old version before installing the new one. Even that venerable security standby did not do well in this new environment. The latest version was obviously rushed to completion by the folks at Symantec. I had considerable difficulty getting the program to register once installed. In fact, after many unsuccessful attempts to achieve this essential operation (otherwise the program ceases to function in 13 days ), I was compelled to seek the help of the good folks utilized by Symantec in India to exercise remote control of my computer to make the necessary adjustments to get NIS up, running and registered.  Needless to say, allowing strangers to poke around inside my computer did not inspire much confidence in the security I was hoping to achieve.\n\nI suppose I should be grateful that I was not one of those unfortunates who made the change to Vista or to Windows 8 (the latter was available as an option, but I elected to stick with Windows 7 on one system, and XP on two others).  If Microsoft will fix the Start menu issues and render Edge fully functional, I believe that I will eventually adjust to this new operating system. And, quite possibly, even like it. I did so when moving from MS-Dos 2.11 to Windows 3.1, then to Windows 95 and onwards to Windows 98, and finally to XP. I never did care much for the change from XP to Win 7. But if nothing else, I do consider myself open to new and improved things...when they are proved better than what they replaced.\n\nUPDATE: 8/20/15 - Installed Classic Shell Startup menu program. Solves ALL the Microsoft shortcomings with the startup menu. Installs easily. Allows for logical modification of the startup folders, simple additions to the \"programs\" listing, and even preserves the Windows 10 startup as an option (tiles and all).\n\nUPDATE: 10/19/15 - The two most recent attempts to install Windows updates KB3093266 and KB3097617 have failed. The latter was supposed to fix the issue in the former. I made 10 unsuccessful attempts to install the most recent update between 10/13/15 and 10/19/15. Windows 10's control panel includes a utility to check and repair installation problems. It failed to do so. A telephone call to Microsoft support ended with a disconnect while waiting for a transfer to a techie who could assist me. An attempt to reconnect with support ended after numerous outgoing recorded messages, including a final one stating that support was overloaded and help could be expected in approximately 30 minutes. It is obvious to me (and others) that Windows 10 was not ready for general release, and unfortunates like me who \"upgraded\" to this latest Microsoft operating system fiasco can expect an indefinite period of frustration and futility while MS gets its act together.  I have downgraded this product rating from 3 stars to 2, and will lower it again if this situation does not improve.\n\nUPDATE:  11/16/15 - The so-called \"Threshold Update\"which Microsoft rolled out Nov. 10-12 (a massive update supposedly equivalent to a \"service Pack,\" or complete substitution for the existing Windows 10 installed free in July) did NOT make it to my computer automatically as promised. I was not alone in this experience. However, I was able to find the solution with the help of Google. The solution was to download the update/upgrade at Microsoft's website and manually install it. It took about 2.5 hours to download and install the entire package. Aside from some minor work needed to fix the Start Menu after the latest version was installed, everything else seems okay. Things appear to work faster, and I am thus far optimistic the switch from Win 7 to Win 10 may eventually prove acceptable. BUT, I still advise friends to wait a bit longer before leaving Win 7 or Win 8 for the new OS.\n\nUPDATE:  8/3/16 - The so-called \"anniversary update\" available 8/1/16 (and gradually making its way to users with Win 10 already installed) is (IMHO) a dreadful disaster. The Start menu has not been fixed -- it is still a disorganized mess. Attempting to organize it so that it is usable is nigh impossible. Even removing items from the Menu is difficult (and nowhere explained). As installed, it is not possible to add or modify the applications (left) side of the Start menu. Thus, customizing it is out of the question. For the past 11 months I installed and utilized \"Classic Shell,\" a godsend alternative to the truly miserable Start Menu.  With the anniversary upgrade this week, the folks at Microsoft to my dismay rendered the Classic Shell incompatible and removed it. Fortunately, the latest version of Classic Shell can be installed and will work with the Win 10 Anniversary update. Those who prefer the Win 7 (XP similar) styled start menu are not stuck with the latest Win 10 abomination.\n\nThe folks at Microsoft now insist that Windows Defender be used instead of at least one anti-malware/anti-virus software preferred by users (in my case, Symantec's well-tested and highly regarded security suites). I have been unable to get Win 10 to allow me to select the latter in place of Defender -- and error notifications persist if I try; mainly to the effect that I have no firewall. This, despite that I have updated Symantec -- which Win 10 seems to accept as compatible, but which nevertheless is not allowed to be selected as the default security program.  And the \"no firewall\" doomsday message continues to appear when it is installed. THEN, after installing the latest Norton update, which worked for one day and disappeared the next, I had to manually install and utilize the latest Norton Removal Tool when all other efforts to restore or repair the preferred Symantec security suite failed. Yesterday's installation had even disappeared from the Win 10 uninstallation menu (and not even Revo Uninstaller could locate it).\n\nSince installing Windows 10 last August, I have managed -- grudgingly -- to learn to live (sort of) with the new Windows Explorer file system (This PC).  I am even somehow, and with difficulty, able to find my way through the vague and cluttered Settings menu. Given time, I have even found and adjusted to the new Control Panel buried two levels down in the Start Menu Folders, and even to the thoroughly counterintuitive interface which now dominates Microsofts latest operating system concoction. But I sorely miss XP (which I continue to use on two computers).", "summary": "When Will They Fix that Awful Start Menu?", "unixReviewTime": 1438992000}

Most of us expected to be able to format our hard disks and be prompted for either the XP disc or product key. Alas, this is not the case. The upgrade is much more complicated than it should be and some workarounds have been discovered\n\nMethod A (simplest)\nIf you already have an older version of Windows on the hard drive, finish the Custom Install, without entering the product key. After installation, go to your System Properties and click the link to activate Windows. Enter your product key and it should activate. This has worked for me twice.\n\nMethod B (hardest)\nIf Method A doesn't work, try the registry hack.\n1. Finish the custom install without entering the product key then click Start and type regedit.exe into the \"Search programs and files\" box.\n2. In the registry, navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Setup/OOBE/. In the pane on the right, you'll see an entry for MediaBootInstall. Double-click on it and change the value from \"1\" to \"0\" and click OK.\n3. Close regedit and go to Start -> All Programs -> Accessories then right-click on Command Prompt and select \"Run as administrator.\" You'll get a UAC alert, click Yes.\n4. At the command prompt, type: slmgr /rearm and hit Enter. Reboot.\n5. Now try to activate. If it fails, make sure there are no pending Windows Updates to install. If there is, install them, reboot and start over from Step 4.\n\nMethod C (most time consuming)\nPerform the Custom Install and skip the product key. Once completed, run the upgrade again from within Windows 7 but this time, enter the Windows 7 upgrade key and then activate Windows.\n** END UPDATE **\n\nI had been running the Windows 7 release candidate for 3 months and the full version 2 weeks before official release date. The experience convinced me to finally upgrade my Windows XP systems to 7. This review briefly touches upon some of the key features and enhancements of Microsoft's latest OS.\n\nPERFORMANCE & STABILITY\nOne of the welcome enhancements Microsoft made was start-up time.  The shutdown time has been improved as well.  Also, in my non-benchmarked experience, Windows 7 has been at least as fast as XP if not faster.  The kernel changes and ability to run the 64-bit version probably has a lot to do with that.  Most benchmarks from around the Internet seem to support my observations.\n\n64-BIT\nI am elated to finally upgrade to a 64-bit operating system in order to take advantage of more memory support and modern processors.  I have Intel Core 2 Duo processors in both my systems with 4GB of physical RAM but XP only allowed 3.25GB for system use.\n\nDESKTOP\nAt first login, you'll notice the changes to the taskbar.  The taskbar is no longer just a place to store quick launch icons and view open windows.  It now provides functionality in the form of Jump Lists, which allow you to select your most frequently opened files or links from the apps you have \"pinned\" on the taskbar.  The clock and calendar are improved and the Show Desktop icon is now integrated in the far right corner.  Other desktop enhancements include Aero Peek, Aero Shake, Snap, new themes and wallpapers.  You also get gadget support.  All of these features combine to create a much improved and enjoyable desktop experience.\n\nLIBRARIES\nWindows 7 introduces a new feature called libraries.  Previously, your system had shortcuts to My Documents, My Music, My Pictures, etc. which had files residing in only those specific folders.  Files can now reside anywhere on your system and be organized inside libraries.  It's similar to how many music and photo applications organize files.\n\nNETWORKING\nEven as good as XP was, networking was cumbersome.  Windows 7 makes connecting two or more Windows 7 systems together easy, using HomeGroup.  This enables easy sharing of files and devices.  One downside is that HomeGroup is only supported between Windows 7 systems.  File transfer performance between computers has been vastly improved and connecting to a wireless network has never been easier on a Windows machine.\n\nSECURITY\nSecurity in Windows 7 is good and comes with Windows Firewall and Defender.  Still, you'll probably want to invest in a more comprehensive Internet security suite, like Norton's.  User Account Control (UAC) has been tweaked in order to give user accounts more flexibility in controlling their own security as well as providing more detailed information so the user can make better decisions about whether to allow certain actions.  Coming from XP however, it is still annoying.  Also, in Windows 7 Ultimate, you can encrypt entire hard drives as well as external portable storage devices, like USB thumb drives.  Though this is a welcome integrated feature, much of the functionality can be found in a popular open-source program called TrueCrypt.\n\nPOWER MANAGEMENT\nPower management has been improved overall and you should be able to squeeze more battery life out of your laptop, even when using your DVD drive.  Sleep and resume has also been improved.  XP wasn't always consistent when entering or resuming from sleep mode, but Windows 7 has been perfect.\n\nWINDOWS MEDIA CENTER\nI've only briefly played around with WMC but it looks promising.  It has some fun options for media, especially when you're connected to the Internet.  It may even be an adequate replacement for component DVR's should you choose to use it as the centerpiece to your entertainment center.  The biggest advantage for me is that Windows 7 now includes a DVD decoder.  This means that I can now watch DVD's natively.  WMC is available in all Windows 7 editions except Starter.\n\nWINDOWS XP MODE\nFor applications that ran in XP, but won't on 7, there is now XP Mode.  It isn't perfect and your system has to have virtualization support and turned on.  Go to your system BIOS to check.  If supported, then install Windows Virtual PC and Windows XP Mode. Check your hardware if you intend to use XP Mode.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\nIf you're an XP holdout, like I was, I recommend upgrading.  Vista SP2 users may have less reason to upgrade but might want to just for the changes to the taskbar and the UAC improvements.  For users who don't need to use their computers in a corporate environment, then Windows 7 Home Premium edition is a good choice.  I'm guessing most power users will choose Professional.  I suggest a clean install for best results.  If you're a Mac OS X user, there is probably nothing in Windows 7 compelling enough for you to consider switching.\n\nSUMMARY\nWindows 7 is the premium Microsoft OS that Windows users have been waiting for.  It's fast, secure, stable, visually appealing and fun to use.  Windows 7 will make your old system feel fresh and new again.  New system owners with Windows 7 pre-loaded can feel confident that they're getting the best Windows OS ever produced.", "summary": "Here Comes Windows 7", "unixReviewTime": 1256169600}

So if you're an experienced Adobe Illustrator user, and hate Adobe's new licensing mode, you might want to consider corel.\n\nBasically you can set some interface elements to match that of Adobe Illustrator. This makes it easy to use when coming from Adobe's side to Corel. Now even though this might make it easy for people to switch over, it doesn't mean that it looks EXACTLY like Illustrator.

I had to purchase the expensive Home and Business version currently priced a penny less than $80 to get it. It was included last year. Not happy about that - minus one star.  There is a $25 refund available, but it is conditional and only applies if you bought the Deluxe version last year. Since I bought the standard version last year, I am not eligible for this new price gouging version.  Minus another star.  They sent an apology email to me, but that didn't sway me in the least - just made me more angry, especially when they wouldn't give me the $25 refund because of the version of TurboTax I bought last year.  I should take off another star, but it does function. So that is where I'll leave it for now.  Their apology is conditional.  They aren't really sorry about anything in my opinion.\n\nI can't envision using any other tax preparation product this year.  Next year I won't buy it if they continue this new tactic.  But I think they aren't backing down in spite of all the negative publicity.  I strongly recommend Turbo Tax, but it depends on what price you have to pay. I've paid for it every year for the past 20 years or so.  I plan to switch to H&B Block next year. I hate price gouging by splitting up an existing product and selling a tiered product line.\n\nOtherwise, Turbo Tax takes most of the pain out of filing and paying taxes. It has a question and answer step-by-step style and is generally very easy to follow and understand. You can also manually fill out forms at random and skip through some areas. It imports key data from the previous year's taxes and automatically inserts routine entries such as names and addresses. Of course you can modify or delete those entries.\n\nIt is very thorough and complete and has a rigorous check for omissions and problems before you officially file the tax return. On some previous annual versions, this check has been annoying because it thought there were some omissions when there weren't any. I had to create an alternative entry just to satisfy the software. In previous years, and probably this year as well, I will have to make fake entries simply to satisfy the software because somebody at TurboTax is completely misinformed (or probably way out of date) about the real estate procurement procedure to buy property in China. They seem to believe an individual cannot purchase property unless they go through some government approved agency. Not true. Starting in 2006, I've purchased and sold more than one property directly. I know this doesn't apply to most people but it affects me.

This makes it so there is no compelling reason to buy the Hallmark card stock rather than card stock made by your printer manufacturer.  Supposedly, papers made by the printer manufacturer are made to work specifically with that brand ink so why bother to buy the Hallmark paper?  I did notice that the cards seem to go through the HP printer easier with fewer roller marks.  To me though, this is just a matter of two negatives cancelling each other out.  One, the Hallmark paper feels to me to be a bit thinner and the second negative is that HP printer design would leave any roller marks at all on photo card paper made by HP.

Today, I tried Photo Director 6 on an iMac. I'd say the whole thing went pretty well.\n\nIt is very easy to install. Just click through the setup, and it's easy to find in Launchpad. It will prompt you at the bottom of the screen to import your pictures the first time the program opens. Takes a while to upload (mine didn't finish the first time--meaning, I got really annoyed with the program and iPhoto and closed it before it had finished uploading), but you can work on pictures while it's uploading.\n\nSo I decided to look at/edit photos from a trip to San Francisco, Carmel, and London. You can see the photos and narratives in my video.  I did some object removal, photo clean-up, color alterations, background removal, exposure setting changes, cropping, and more.\n\nAbout the Fisherman's Wharf picture, where I removed the black triangle in the corner and the power cord: This was so easy to do! There are automatic tools for literally all of this. It even recreated the letters across the Fisherman's Wharf sign. Impressive!\n\nAdjusting the RGB curve is simple.\n\nAdding noise is easy, but looks more extreme in the program. The photos don't show the high amounts of \"noise\" that I added as much as I thought they would.\n\nThe background removal tool doesn't work too well if your background is blurry.  But in my example, it worked well (and it was very simple to use).  In my example, I added a new background to make it look like he was in a more natural environment.\n\nMy first complaint: it is so hard to find photos.  I edited the Fisherman's Wharf photo twice because I tried to move it from iPhoto to my Desktop so that I could share it. Moving it caused Photo Director to lose it. I could not find the edited version in either iPhoto or my Desktop, or, for that matter, Photo Director. It was just gone. So I had to edit it again. Now I can't find the 1st butterfly photo with the background removed.\n\nThe London photo was edited using the \"People Beautifier\" tool.  I only used a few of the features, but it is very simple and the results can be drastic.  The close-up screenshots show how  much better the picture looks with the skin tone adjusted and the environment brightened up.\n\nSo, the bottom line:\n- Export your photos as soon as you're done editing them, or else good luck finding them again.\n- This program has great features to automatically edit photos, but there are no automatic adjustments (e.g., contrast, tone, curves)\n- This is a great, cheaper alternative to Photoshop.\n- It works with a Mac. (Hurray!)\n- If you are familiar with Photoshop, you will have no problem with this program.\n- If you have never edited a photo in your life, this program is much more simplistic than Photoshop (and other major photo editing programs), but can do a lot of the same things.\n\nThis program is not perfect, but I no longer feel the need to go buy myself a copy of Photoshop.", "summary": "A great alternative to Photoshop--and works with Mac!", "unixReviewTime": 1417392000}

Eye", "reviewText": "Note: In this review, I purposefully did NOT read the user manual and I expected all features to be obvious (e.g. on a par with other video/audio editing software) in the execution of Pinnacle software.\n\nIn mid December, 2014: I loaded Pinnacle Plus V18 from the CD and got installation error messages from Windows:\n\n1. Cant open .dtd file. Windows says this is a Unix hyperhelp support file. I don't know what is trying to open this file. I told it to use Pinnacle to open it, figuring it might be a Pinnacle help file.\n2. Cant open .wmdb file. This is a windows media database file developed by Microsoft. So, what is trying to open it?\n3. Cant open .all file. A .all file is on my computer. Steinberg VST uses .all files.\n4. Cant open .ovw file. This is a Cool Edit Pro file.\n\nIn the above cases, if Pinnacle was trying to open these files, why would I not get an error message from Pinnacle?\nI brought up Pinnacle. The program (organizer) started searching my entire disk for all possible movies, music, and photos, loading icons of them into a Media tab. I have hundreds of video files and thousands of pictures and audio files. It then proceeded to tell me about errors loading various files. In my opinion, it would be preferable, and far less time consuming, to allow me to open my own files and folders to add media, rather than defaulting to loading ALL media. It could give me an option to load all media.\n\nThere was a new version to download. So that took another 10 minutes or so.\n\nNoticed the graphics on my screen were not very clear. The letters were tiny and jammed together. The program should make adjustments for the screen resolution I am using.\n\nI brought up Pinnacle and tried to load a .MTS file from a folder. It did not seem to recognized .MTS files, so I could not use it to create the video I needed to edit. Dont know whether I didn't wait long enough or whether it was a new version, but so be it.\n\nAbout a week later: I brought started Pinnacle again and it was now loading .MTS files - all of them on my disk. This time, I was able to drag and drop a .MTS file into the AV1 timeline. There is a view screen of the video loaded and current time position. To see if I could capture a picture or get a list of handy commands for the current video, I tried to right click on the current frame of the view screen. No option list came up. I would have preferred to see at least SOME commonly used options like Add Effect, Add Transition, save frame as Image, File Info, or things like that. Instead, I had to hunt for commands, icons, or options.\n\nOn the Media Tab, I wanted to drag and drop a movie. By the time the organizer finally finished loading all music, photos, and videos on my computer, it had hundreds of folder names, each one expanded and showing me icons of all the media files it recognized. I could not collapse these categories all at once via any options I found. I tried ctrl-minus keys at the same time, but that shortened the video I had in the timeline. So I undid that via ctrl-z (thinking that would undo the last command) and it removed the video from the AV1 timeline. Sigh.\n\nI also notice that when I click on various things and edited video, the place in the Media Tab re-centered itself to a midpoint (in my photo library) that was not anywhere near where I actually was my position of hundreds of media folders. So I had to keep re-scrolling and finding where the clips were. Not good.\n\nThere is a Navigation title on the left side of the Media Tab and it has some options, but none to collapse all categories. It does allow view of only videos. But then, I have a folder where I keep my free video music from other video software. This is a really cumbersome user interface. Again, I should have been able to tell it what to load rather than having all this stuff visible in a miles-long longitudinal list of folders and files.\n\nThere is a 3D option at the menu top. This allows view of only 3D (to view only three-dimensional images and videos in my library). I clicked on this since I have NO 3D files on my computer. It never did complete, but it told me it was filtering... I stopped it because I had to sleep sometime.\n\nAdjusting Video: The original video I shot was indoors and was too reddish and too saturated. I selected the video adjustments and clicked on White Balance and Levels. On my screen, this appeared to automatically adjust the picture, but it was not good looking on my screen. So, I played with the adjustments.\n\nThe individual adjustments are pretty good. There is one called Haze that I have not seen in other editors and appears to adjust the haziness of the video. That is a really nice and UNIQUE feature.\n\nThe White Balance adjustment works like a photo editor, except this is on the video section. You select (via an eyedropper) a spot on the current frame that is supposed to be white. The editor adjusts all the colors of that video in order to make that spot white. This is a very handy and user-friendly feature to have for color adjustment. I have not seen this photographic feature on other video editors.\n\nThe program appears to have other handy features, like its competitors, for things like splitting audio from video, taking a snapshot of a frame and saving it, splicing at the frame level, and others. Roxio (in my older versions) does not have frame by frame editing/splicing.\n\nAudio: There is a graphic representation of the audio, panning, and volume. One of the volume adjustment knobs is for master level and one for current position. However, when I adjusted the current position volume, it lowered the level of the entire video. When I split the video, it adjusted the sound of the section I was on. So, the wording is misleading. However, you can add key frames (simply by clicking on the audio green line) to allow increasing or decreasing volume (and fade out/in) so that any loud or weak areas in the audio can be manually altered. This feature is similar to other product audio timeline methods, but in my opinion, it was more user friendly and obvious to a video-phile.\n\nWhen I right click on a clip, it should allow me to add fade in and out of audio with some default setting (e.g. 1 second). I did not see this option anywhere and it seemed I had to manually add fade in and out of audio. I may have missed something, but it wasn't obvious.\n\nTitles/Text: I really liked the way the titles allow for graphical real-time fade in and out, time stretching, colorizing, etc. The click and drag method of fade-in and fade-out for a clip is much easier to adjust than using new window timelines with separate marker drags and drops. Pinnacle allows it right on the clip itself without having to deal with new windows and marking/unmarking. So, by adjusting the timeline wide enough, it is much faster to create an overlapping fading in and out title/text for a clip. Also, I noticed that dragging the timeline out and in also keeps the fade in and out at the ends of the title. With some other video editing programs, one has to manually go back in and move the start of fade in or fade-out to a different position if the title is extended.\n\nSnapshot a frame: It is easy to take a snapshot. Find the frame you want and click the camera button. This puts the picture in a Collection tab along with the other tabs for media and transitions, etc. However, I could not find an easy way to get all the photos I took from the Collection tab to the file folder I wanted them in. Instead, I had to click on each photo, right click, select export, and wait for the exporter to come up. Little did I know that each photo was in a different folder. I would much rather have the program ask me where to place photos than to put them somewhere and then allow users to later discover them somewhere on their drive. There was also an autoname checkbox. Thinking that this would auto-name each photo by adding a number to it, I checked it (and by the way, it did add a number to each photo). Because I did not know these were saved automatically somewhere else, the autoname came up on every single photo I was saving to the folder I had selected. I believed I had to click it and export each and every photo. And each photo save asked me if I wanted to overwrite every time I exported. Each photo save also gave me an option to open the folder to view the photo (which I declined since I had just saved it). Come on folks, just tell me in the beginning where photos are being saved, and don't ask me to open it each time!!\n\nClip Manipulation: One can mark a beginning clip, go to a later clip, and hold down shift and click on that last clip you want in the clicked series (just like clicking on first and last Windows files in an Explorer Window). You can also stay in zoom mode and hit the end key to get to the last clip. When you hit shift-click, all clips will then be selected in between. This allows grouping or moving a sequence of clips. Some other programs do not allow that shift-click to mark all clips in between. Rather, you have to use the mouse to click and drag across all clips to mark them for moving. Pinnacle allows both methods. That, I like!\n\nOn the down side, moving a clip to the left leaves the other clips where they were and creates a gap. There is a Magnetic Snapping button, and a Smart Editing selection that seem (as they are worded)  to allow for automatic clip moving. However, I could not get these to move the following clips to close a gap automatically. So, I had to select all clips (from the gap on) and move them manually. They snapped to the end of the last clip gap, but I would have preferred that the gap close automatically.\n\nOne last note. When you copy (ctrl-c) and paste (ctrl-v) a text title, it creates a duplicate of the text title to which you can then add or modify text, length, fades, etc. It does not affect the original title. At least one other competitive product changes the original title when you change the copy. I find that more difficult to work with than a clean, new, editable copy.\n\nDisc Menus: I found this mostly straightforward to use. One great feature is that you can move sub-menus to a previous menu and delete the subsequent sub-menus. I cannot do this with other pre-canned menus and sub-menus. They do not allow moving of scenes or adding to the number of scenes the say Pinnacle does.\n\nOne thing seemed to be a bug. I changed the color of text on the Scene Selection button on the main menu. In the editor, I changed it to red, but it appeared black in the editor. When I clicked OK, the viewer and thumbnails showed red text. But pressing play on the menu viewer (to simulate a DVD menu) showed black. Then I discovered the Stereoscopic button had been checked. I don't recall checking this, but I might have. Since I don't have anything 3-D, this was a nuisance (as well as mind-bender).\n\nSaving files: It was not apparent that I could save a project and have everything (including disc processing) saved. When I created a menu, it seemed to be a separate disc project file. It was not clear that the original movie project file had or had not been saved when I saved a disc project file. Since these are all in the same video editor, it would be easier to use if it were a single project save, and not separate saves. Also, it seemed to be an Export rather than a save. To this user, export implies a new changed rendering of a video file. This is completely different than saving the video editing of a file which is a completely separate formatting of an original file which does not change the original.\n\nBurning to Disc: I could not burn the project to a DVD. Although I inserted a blank DVD+R and the file size to be written was only 17 minutes of video, it told me the medium did not match 4.7GB and asked if I should proceed anyway. I said Yes. It told me there was not enough room to burn the disc even though it showed there was plenty of room. I tried several blank DVD+R disks, and a dual layer blank disk. Same message.\n\nI went to the website to see about technical support. The instructions said I should have received a number when I registered my product and that I had to have registered within the last 14 days to get technical support. I received a password via email but no such number. The only telephone number to call was a sales line. I checked the FAQs and found the error message I had received, but the only fix for it was to insert the proper sized disc. There is an option to submit an impersonal (email) request for technical support or to have paid support. This is a rabbit hole I did not go down. There was no technical chat capability.\nSo, now I have a fully edited movie, a fully edited menu, and no way to save it to a DVD or to be sure I have saved it to my hard drive. And, no way to contact Pinnacle directly in my hour of need before I shut down. Pinnacle users may derive what they will. Adobe encourages its users to contact them directly. Hmmm...\n\nSummary: I found most of the software features to be as good as, or better than, competitive products.\n  Copy and paste of a title creates an independent copy of that title;\n  Adjusting video includes a haze adjustment;\n  Clip length is easy to adjust and has the fade (video/audio) move with the adjustment;\n  Marking clips for inclusion in a group is straightforward (click first and shift-click last marks all clips in between); and,\n  Taking a frame snapshot is easy.\n\nSome areas of improvement were the following.\n Initial installation gave mysterious error messages for file types I had to look up;\n Two new versions were released in the week I tested this;\n The automatic population of the library is very cumbersome when you have thousands of files on your system. It should ask  before doing this;\n Right clicking on the view port should have some kind of menu;\n A right click on the clip (audio or video) should allow for selection of either to fade-in and/or fade-out;\n Could not find an easy way to close gaps created when a clip is moved to the left or right.\n Have some way for users to contact the help desk when there is an obvious problem.\n There should at least be a technical chat capability for quick questions.", "summary": "Some innovative excellent features on par or better than competition were not outweighed by the cumbersome features", "unixReviewTime": 1419724800}

I don't understand exactly WHY removing Norton solved my problems but I can tell you this: My computer has NEVER run so well and with so few problems. No crashes, no hanging up on shut down or start up, and lightening quick responsiveness once again.\n\nThe problems caused by this Norton program flummoxed until I finally isolated Norton as the culprit. I googled my multitude of problems and found that several people were have the same sorts of problems and identified Norton as the root cause. At first I rejected out of hand that a company as legendary and well regarded as Norton could be at the root of my problems, but decided out of frustration to delete the program and see how it impacted the multiple problems I was having.\n\nLow and behold my problems miraculously vanished! I couldn't believe it! My daughter who had problems on start up worse than mine balked too at removing this program from her laptop but also discovered that the removal of Norton solved HER problems as well.\n\nThe new interface, to my way of thinking, is not as good as prior versions. Installation itself can be an adventure in frustration as it was for me. Worse, taking the damn thing off presents unique problems as well.\n\nI told one of my friends what I'd discovered and he too deleted the program only to see all of his multiple problems disappear! He told me that he simply couldn't believe how good his computer was once again functioning. My uncle called me yesterday. He resisted taking Norton off his computer because he thought I was exaggerating the problems caused by Norton. He finally took Norton off when another of his friends told him the same thing. He told me he should have acted sooner thereby saving him all sorts of problems and heartaches.\n\nI've replaced Norton Antivirus with Trend Micro's PC-Cillin and Zone Alarm both of which are highly regarded. Other highly regarded antivirus programs that are NOT resource hogs and do not cause the multitude of problems caused by this bloated pig of a software program are AVG antivirus from Grissoft and Avast! antivirus - both work great.\n\nIf you are having unexplained problems with your computer that your anti-virus program and spyware programs are not solving and if you have this bloated pig of a program on your computer then you need to delete it.\n\nNorton is busy destroying its franchise. I will not put ANY Symantec software on my computer. They are quirky, resource hogging, intrusive garbage which are nearly impossible to completely uninstall from your computer.

If you've got 25 years of financial matter then you had better consider using a virtual machine or going back to a pc.\n\n By this point you've figured it's easier to just download your account information from banks and brokerages but this is where Essentials does fail the Windows user.\n\n You first have to download the information as a Web Connect file to your desktop and then drag and drop it to a box in Quicken at which point it's loaded as an account.  Sound familiar?  If you use Quicken's online equivalent at [...] this is nearly the same procedure minus the drag and drop.  This means you'll have to open a browser, go to your bank or brokerage, open the account, download the file to the desktop, close your browser session and then drag and drop the desktop file.  Once you delete the desktop file you've just completed seven steps to create an account.\n\n And who thought this up?\n\n However, once that procedure is done you've got your accounts up and running.  Minor inconvenience compared to the original Quicken I used many years ago that required manual entries and had nothing in the way of internet connection.\n\n Other complaints seem to focus on the lack of online bill paying through this Quicken, a feature I never used or appreciated in the Windows version because it wasn't free.  I've just used my bank's free only bill payment feature therefore I can't comment on what I don't use.\n\n Yes, you could use equivalents such as Moneydance, iBank or iCash but none offer online updating - Quicken has a lock on that feature.\n\n In addition, you can't lose with Quicken because of the 60 day unconditional money back guarantee.  If you don't like it, return the software for a full refund.  I've used the refund procedure one time (last year when a relative gifted me a Starter edition when I wanted Deluxe) and they do honor it.  Buy Moneydance or iCash and there is no refund since they offer a free trial.\n\n Overall I just didn't see much to be negative about with this program.  It does what it was designed to do and does it well.  It won't please advanced users expecting minute-by-minute stock updates and flashing lights, but it does an admirable job for the intended purpose.", "summary": "Not Bad for Intended Use", "unixReviewTime": 1274832000}

This game sets the standard to what the majority of Nancy Drew games contain, and is the first to use the formal \"Nancy Drew case formula\". It is this game that employs several aspects that become rules for future cases, such as \"there must always be four suspects\" and \"there must always be a long-lost treasure\".\n\nRose Green, a friend of Hannah Gruen's (Nancy's housekeeper), has recently purchased a Victorian mansion in San Francisco, California. She and her friend and co-owner, Abby Sideris, hope to turn the place into a bed-and-breakfast by the following month. However, several peculiar accidents have been getting in the way of the renovations. Hannah asks that Nancy go over to help complete the renovation, while secretly performing an investigation to find out just what's causing the accidents. Nancy soon finds herself in an old mansion that's filled with a dark past, unexplainable shadows, ghostly voices, and unexpected accidents that could happen at any moment. Is an inhabitant of this manor trying to scare everybody away, or are the restless spirits of the previous owners truly back to haunt the place?\n\nThe plot used in this game is phenomenal, and a great idea for Nancy's first \"haunted house\" mystery. Even though the criminal in this game isn't a killer, it still holds on to the scare factor that the first two held, and the danger does become life-threatening at times. The game itself does get pretty scary, and all of the references to the history of California and China that were employed in the plot were very well-integrated.\n\nI will come out and say this about the plot: the ending does become very predictable if one pays attention closely. The location of the ending, the history of the Valdez family (the family who originally owned the manor), the culprit, and his/her intentions all become rather obvious. This is a slight downside, but regardless, all of these aspects of the plot were perfectly executed.\n\nEven though this is only the third game, the quality of this game rivals (and usually even goes beyond) most of the modern games. There are still chores that need to be done and puzzles to solve, but Nancy doesn't spend more time doing chores than investigating or performing puzzle after puzzle after puzzle like she does in several of the more recent games. This game has the perfect blend of sleuthing, puzzle-solving, and chores.\n\nThe graphics in this game might show the age on occasion, but they're still rather nice, and almost as good as graphics in a modern game would be. The manor is beautifully detailed, and all of the ghostly haunts that are seen with the eye are wonderfully animated. The character designs are a little more smooth and realistic than the ones in the previous game, now looking like a cross between Barbie dolls and actual human anatomy.\n\nThe characters were casted wonderfully, and they were all well-integrated into the story. Rose Green, the owner, is the frustrated woman who spent her entire life savings into the house. She's very determined to stick with the place, but is starting to get discouraged. Abby Sideris is her eccentric business partner, who believes in ghosts and all sorts of supernatural phenomenon. At one point in the game, she even hosts a sance to contact the spirit haunting the house. Charlie Murphy is a young man who's currently employed to help with the renovations. He seems young and inexperienced, but is actually very knowledgeable and is studying history at the local community college. Louis Chandler is an antique dealer about Rose's age, and he's helping the others find some good authentic dcor to keep the traditional Victorian feel while renovating the manor into a B&B.\n\nOne wonderful aspect about the cast in Message in a Haunted Mansion that definitely deserves mention is the perfect choice for the culprit. It's not quite like the previous game, Stay Tuned for Danger, in which Mattie, Rick, Dwayne, Lillian, Bill, and Millie all have solid motives to send the threats to Rick and could very well be the culprit at the end. There's only one character in this game that would seem to profit well from performing these acts of vandalism around the house, and I cannot see any of the other suspects being the culprit in the end.\n\nThe music in the game was perfect. It made an already very frightening house seem even more haunted. There wasn't a single track that felt out of place, and they ranged from slightly eerie to downright terrifying. The Chinese music heard in Nancy's bedroom complimented the dcor as well, as her room is full of old Chinese furnishings.\n\nMessage in a Haunted Mansion has brought the Nancy Drew games from sub-par, old school fun to true accomplishments in the history of adventure gaming. From this point forward, the Nancy Drew games have a tendency to be amazing. Despite the age, this beautiful game full of ghostly frights remains in my top ten favorite Nancy Drew games of all time.", "summary": "The Message: This Game Rocks!", "unixReviewTime": 1306368000}

If you filed last year with TurboTax 2012, yes, it is basically the exact same program. But the behind-the-scenes stuff gets updated with new forms and tax laws, etc. I'm sure all of that costs plenty to keep up with, justifying having to re-buy what seems like the same program every year. Though it does beg the question, could we maybe just buy a single TurboTax and pay each year just for the updates and to e-file, instead of re-buying nearly identical software, and a new box and disc and updated marketing, etc. But I digress.\n\nI file Married Filing Jointly and have a pretty simple tax situation (wife and I each have one job, no kids, standard deduction). And for this purpose it was EXTREMELY easy and simple to file. I've used TurboTax since 2011, and I really like how it imports the previous year and unless anything major has changed, you basically just swap some numbers around and you are DONE! I probably spent less than 10 minutes importing my 2012 return and updating it for 2013. Since I've used TurboTax for the last 3 years, it also shows you a tax history with your history of income and taxes. It's kind of fun to see a trendline over the years, especially if it is (hopefully) in the upward direction.\n\nWhat I also like, is switching back and forth between the \"hold my hand' version of the software and the raw tax forms. Some of the questions and situations TurboTax asks me about, I am curious what actual tax basis there is to the question. So after I fill it out, I switch to the forms and see exactly which fields on which forms are being populated based on my answers. It can help you understand tax filing much better to actually look at all the forms being submitted rather than relying solely on the user-friendly walkthrough version. But if that stuff doesn't interest you, it seems accurate and reliable enough to not really need to fret too much over it either.\n\nMake sure you look at the difference between the TurboTax versions (Basic, Deluxe, Premier, Home & Business) so you don't leave tax deductions/credits on the table. Deluxe was what I needed, but depending on your situation it may benefit you to pay a little extra for the pricier ones. If you have a pretty simple tax situation and could file a 1040EZ, the cheapest basic one could be all you need. If you are self-employed, own a business, trade stocks, I would look into the Premier or Home & Business options.\n\nIf you are new to TurboTax and will not have anything to import from last year, it takes a little longer, but it is still pretty quick to enter everything in. I could maybe do mine from scratch in 20 minutes. Granted, many people have all kinds of deductions and credits or self-employment details (or if you bought/sold real estate or stocks etc.) that could drastically lengthen the time it takes to go through the process. But all I know, is for me personally, this product is simple, thorough, and exactly what I needed. I fully intend to purchase TurboTax again next tax year.\n\nFYI: The IRS will not process returns in 2014 for tax year 2013 until after January 31st, so don't feel too rushed to buy this and file immediately, as you will still need to wait until *at least* February for any possible refund.", "summary": "If you've used TurboTax before, you know what to expect.", "unixReviewTime": 1388966400}

Gold", "reviewText": "Please see [...] for a comparison of the features in pre-ribbon versions of Word to WordPerfect. It is enlightening!\n\nIt is hard to believe it is two years since Corel released X3.  When I found out that the new X4 version had been released, I downloaded the one month demo from Corel.  I highly recommend the product.\n\nI don't have much use for anything in the suite except WordPerfect.  I've been using WordPerfect since before Windows, when it had a blue screen, displayed ASCII characters in Courier font (there were no fonts except Courier), and laser printers cost a small fortune. I work for a number of attorneys -- WordPerfect is the software of choice for word processing in most offices I've worked in because, in my opinion, it is the better product for the job. It may also be because WordPerfect has been around for so long that everyone just migrated without changing. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!\n\nUniversal File Support\n\nWordPerfect has very good compatibility with other file formats making it nearly universal.  It includes PDF file support which Corel continues to improve in this version.  It saves directly to PDF format Corel has now added optical character recognition so you can import PDF files directly into a text document.  Although it is not perfect, it converts to and from numerous Word formats including RTF, and all versions through 7.  It also supports other formats including WordStar, AMI, OfficeWriter, Lotus, Multimate and numerous others.  Please see [...] for a comparison of the different versions.\n\nSkins\n\nCorel also added two themes so that the skin looks more like XP/Vista, and for those who need it, the Word Count feature is on the application bar at the bottom of the WordPerfect window.  This new version appears to be very stable.\n\nExceptional Word Processing Capabilities\n\nWhen WordPerfect came out, it took over the market. (It was far superior to the software then available, and remains one of the best.) When MicroSoft came out with Word, I had the feeling they did everything they could to make it different from WordPerfect just to use their power in the industry to take over the word processing market, just like MicroSoft did with every other good software idea to come along. (e.g., Mozilla/Netscape, Norton Utilities.)\n\nI have three versions of Word (2000, 2003 and 2007) and WordPerfect 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, X3 and now X4.  I use the MicroSoft product only when absolutely necessary -- usually because someone else sends me a document in that format. The new version of Word is unfamiliar - the traditional pull down menus have been placed sideways on toolbars and rearranged so it is uncomfortable to use.  If possible, I will use WordPerfect and save it as a Word document using the \"SAVE AS\" feature on the \"file\" pull down menu.\n\nThe reason I like WordPerfect so much is that it types more like a typewriter. You can set up and use styles if you want, but you can also just hit the tab button to indent the first line of a paragraph. If you want to change the margins for the entire document, you simply change the margins. The rest of the document follows the change. You don't have to change each paragraph.\n\nIn addition, you can get to the formatting codes. Hit Alt-F3 and the screen splits in half and displays all of the format codes -- bold, underline, tabs, indent codes, line spacing, column on and off, etc. Then you know exactly what you have done and fix and format it easily. This ability has proven useful on several occasions when clients, who insist on using Word for legal documents, cannot cajole Word to put their unruly documents into the format they want. (This is particularly true when using OCR with scanned or faxed documents.) By opening the Word document in WordPerfect, I have been able to use \"Alt-F3\" to identify the errant codes and quickly repair them. WordPerfect can then save the document in Word/RTF format with the problems fixed. This is particularly useful when combined with the global search and replace. For example, you can search and replace all [paragraph style] and end up with a manageable document.\n\nWorking with columns is also easier. You turn on columns and tell it how many colums you want, set the width of each, and the space between them, and away you go. You have four types of columns to work with -- newspaper, balanced newspaper, parallel and parallel with block protect. I've tried the other software, and if you change text or printers, you can never get the columns to line up the way you want it. With Word, each column change or page change seems to introduce a whole new set of control codes, and a complete set of formatting, and you can never get it back the way you want it. I once tried to scan in a list of names and addresses which were in two or three columns into Word. Each name and address was placed in its own text box. I could never work with it.\n\nAnother very important feature is the ability to view a document from the \"open document\" screen without having to actually open up the document. This way, if you are searching for a specific document or a document containing certain specific information or \"language\" you need, you don't have to serially open a document, close it, open another document, and so on until you find the one you want. This is particularly powerful when combined with the \"find document\" feature on the \"open document\" screen. Using the find button opens a screen which is similar to the windows \"search\" screen. You can type in a series of words, and WordPerfect will search all files on the hard drive or in the folder/subfolders in which you are working for all documents containing your target search terms. You can then scroll through and look at each document to quickly determine their contents. From the \"find\" screen, you can access the \"quickfinder\" program which pre-scans folders on the computer so that searching for documents is nearly instantaneous. Just tonight I needed to find a \"Declaration re Ex Parte Notice\" to use as a template from among thousands of documents. The entire search took perhaps half a minute.\n\nThe most prominent change between WP 10 and 12/X3/X4 is the workspace manager which allows you to switch between legal mode, original (classic) WordPerfect 5.1 mode (with the blue screen), legal mode, standard WordPerfect for Windows mode and Word mode. They have also included and upgraded the ability to publish to Adobe PDF, HTML, and RTF/Word formats.\n\nThis is full featured software, and does everything I need. It handles tables, tables of content, tables of authorities, column sorts -- everything I need in a law office. Graphics can be dropped in with a click of the mouse. I'm considered to be almost an expert, and there is a lot I don't know!\nOne of the great advantages of WordPerfect is that the files are much smaller than Word documents. This means you can transport them on floppy drives.\nAs a final thought, Word is very powerful and works very well for short documents such as business letters. If you do anything over several pages, you are much better off with WordPerfect.\n\nTake time to get to know the software and you'll be glad you purchased it.\n\nOther Programs:\n\nThe Corel Office package includes replacement programs for most of the stuff in Microsoft Office.  The suite includes a Microsoft Outlook replacement (Mail), a PowerPoint replacement (Presentation), an exceptional spreadsheet program (Quattro) and Lightning.  I haven't yet figured out what Lightning does except act as a notebook of some sort.", "summary": "The Better Wordprocessor", "unixReviewTime": 1220486400}

I decided after riding in my mom's Toyota Sienna that her GPS system was excellent. Keep in mind, she had a high dollar system so I expected it to be much better then anything I would buy that is portable.\n\nI bought Streets and Trips 2006 at my local best buy store for $89, it came with the GPS locator. I had my laptop in the car with me so I installed the software and it started to work immediatly, I was impressed that it pinpointed my location as quickly as it did. I typed in my home address and bingo, it routed me onto the interstate and home. That part worked perfectly. I will say that on the way home on I-40 they shifted the road for road construction, the system was so accurate there that it kept saying \"OFF ROUTE\" because the lanes were temp. shifted about 30 feet onto the shoulder, that was pretty cool. Overall with this I was impressed.\n\nWhat I was not impressed with was: I live on a major road, about 1.5 miles behind my place is a wal-mart with several roads that go to it. When I used the GPS system to navigate me to the store it tried to route me on a 10 mile trip, apparently some of the roads I normally take were not in the map database. In fact there was a total of 3 missing roads in this one 1.5 mile area that had been in Knoxville since I moved here 4 years ago. These are not brand new roads, they are at minimum 4 years old and SHOULD be in the map database.\n\nOther issues I have with the software include the Pocket PC piece. While the pocket PC does display the maps perfectly it will not create routes for you. Additionally if you try to hook the GPS locator up to your pocket pc you will find that it does not ROUTE or NAVIGATE you. The GPS locator simply shows you on the map where you are, in my case it was about 1/4 mile off, this was a  huge problem for me. The reason I bought it was so I could put my pocket pc in my truck and use that as my navigation system. Not so, it doesn't speak, it doesn't route, it doesn't navigate. It's just a picture with a moving dot that represesnts your current position.\n\nSpeaking of, speaking. The program does offer verbal turn by turn guidance, however do NOT expect this program to announce the names of the streets you are to turn on. It simply says \"TURN LEFT\", I would have liked it to say \"TURN LEFT ON MAIN STREET\" for example.\n\nNorth, south, east or west??? One more thing I don't like about this program is lack of detail in directions. I punched in to go from work to home and it routed me via interstates. When I left work and neared the on-ramp it said \"TURN RIGHT in .3 miles\", the screen showed \"TURN RIGHT ON I-40\", it didn't tell me east or west. Then on my way home I take the I-75 split, it said \"STAY RIGHT\" but it didn't display if I needed I-75 North or south. Had construction been going on and lanes shifted, etc I would not have known what road to take because it didn't say the direction to go in. Simply not enough information.\n\nAnother gripe, re-route is not an automated feature. I wish Microsoft would have put an option on the program to \"AUTO RE-ROUTE\" if you are off of the designated route when using your laptop and the locator. Instead it says \"OFF ROUTE\" and you either have to drive back on route or press the F3 button or click the \"RE-ROUTE\" button. Seems silly it can't do this automatically.\n\nAnd one last gripe, there is an offramp here in knoxville where you can not make a right turn, it is posted and illegal. This software when I am on my way to work constantly tells me to make that right turn. That is one big issue.\n\nOverall, the product works as expected for a $90 GPS solution. It would have received 5 stars if the Pocket PC piece actually was useful and if a few of the roads around me that had been around were in the database. It works decent, but not good enough. This is a good \"test\" program to use to see if GPS is for you. I have since stopped using the GPS locator part and simply use streets and trips at home to plan my trips, figure out mileage, etc. I now use a Magellan Roadmate 760 which I purchased here at Amazon as my in car navigation system.\n\nI would have expected Microsoft, the large company they are to have a more up to date, hi-tech program. This thing doesn't speak street names, doesn't tell which dirction to go when approaching freeways and interstates. It will get you where you are going, but the lack of updated roads make take you well out of your way to get there.", "summary": "Not good, it works, but several complaints.

Everytime you open Quicken, it will tell you you made changes, whether you did or not, and suggest that you sync.  This should be an automated, behind the scenes process, it's not hard.\n3.  The alerts are rather dumb, and they're essentially hard-coded.  You can't create your own rules, and you can't even do a lot with the built-in rules (you can just pick some parameters from a limited list).  You can't delete them all either, if you consider them dumb and pointless.  Again, not hard to do a lot better.\n\nThere are no significant improvements in reporting, or in investment analysis.  If you look at the \"What's new in 2013\" page, you see mobile, alerts, and \"more flexible budgeting\", whatever that means.\n\nThere is a tweak to how accounts show up in the nav bar, where you can put some accounts in the \"Separate\" list, which means \"show but don't include with main set of accounts\".  This is mildly useful.  There's also a feature to mark an account \"closed\", also slightly useful -- in theory.  These account still show up in the list of accounts when you're doing a transfer between investment accounts!  Clearly someone forgot what the word \"closed\" might mean.\n\nSo all in all, same old Intuit, same old Quicken.  Buy it if the mobile feature is useful to you.  (BTW, I tried Mint as an alternative, and I couldn't stand the heavy-duty selling on every darned screen.  Maybe some people can tune this stuff out, I couldn't.)", "summary": "cloud feature is disappointing", "unixReviewTime": 1370390400}

However, I have to say that I was a lot more impressed with this than I was ever with 2009. Bitdefender 2009 brought me nothing but heartache and brought my computer down because of different incompatibility issues with other software.\n\nThe installation of 2010 was very easy and it had even let me keep using my 2009 key if I wanted to. I had installed this on three different Operating Systems: two running Windows 7 and one running Windows XP. The first Windows 7 installation did encounter some problems but I was able to let it do a scan of my computer and then re-installed and it worked fine. The Windows XP one had the 2009 version on it and it went very fast without any problems. I had found that after installing 2010 on the Windows XP, that I had a lot less bugs than before. However, since my computer was just bogged down with too much applications and files on it, I did a new install of Windows 7. With the newest Windows 7, I installed 2010 and again, no problems whatsoever. It was smooth and ran very fast. In fact, I barely notice the antivirus running.\n\nThe backup is very easy to setup. Just note that the online backup is only for a limited amount of time. I believe it is for one year. All of the other features work great and the new look is so much better than before. It's less bulky and more attractive.\n\nOverall, I am happy with this product and has provided a lot less hassle for me than last year's version.

I am using it to protect a mix of Windows systems ranging from Vista through Win 8.

The Task Manager shows that Norton's CPU utilization is being held to about 6% and the memory footprint is under 100MB...those numbers obviously increase when I stop typing and the scheduler allocates more resources to Norton.  Bottom line, though, is that usability of my system isn't impacted by the scan.\n\nSince being installed, Norton has flagged multiple suspect emails, a couple of web sites and a downloaded .msi file.  The .msi file was flagged based on Norton's \"reputation\" algorithm, as opposed to actually analyzing the file.  Since it was a purchased program from Elcomsoft, a leading forensics software vendor, that was a bit annoying...especially since it immediately erased the file. I had to temporarily disable Norton to get it installed.  Subsequent deep system scans haven't detected any issues with my system.\n\nMy Recommendation: The cost per seat is reasonable.  It does the job that it's intended to do.  It has minimal impact on system resources.

Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both TaxCut and TurboTax to compare. I found that TurboTax did not do anything better than TaxCut while costing consistently more.\n\n INSTALLATION\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.\n\n If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you dowload it.  The key-code can be located two ways.\nOption 1: After my download finished the install started automatically offering me a choice of two links \"View Keys\" and \"Install\". When I selected view key-code after a fairly long pause it displayed my key-code in a browser window.\nOption 2: You can locate it in your Amazon account:\n1) Log into Amazon\n2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page\n3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in\n4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software\n\n Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs?\nI found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic \"Installing Software on Another Computer\"\nI quote the FAQ answer below:\n\"There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.\nInsert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer.\nClick the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen.\nThe Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, \"Can I install the software on a second computer?\"\nEnter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate.\nYou can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail.\nFollow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.\"\n\n WHAT IS INCLUDED\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nI purchased a digital download version of H&R Block Deluxe plus State. This version entitles you to 5 free federal e-files.  You can print and mail as many returns as you want, there is no limit on printing.\n\nOne state software is included in the package but the package does NOT include free e-file for the state return (see one exception below). If you want to e-file  your state return you will need to pay a fee of $19.95 to e-file each state return. Alternatively, you can print all the forms and mail them using US post office.  If you need to file taxes for an additional state, each additional state is $39.95 plus $19.95 e-file fee.  Ouch!\n\nNote: NY state residents can e-file state returns for free.\n\n GENERAL\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nI just finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until January 9, 2014.\n\n H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version.  That would have been useful.\n\nWhat is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.\n\nNote that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations. Last year I had to do both and I found the guidance in Deluxe package was sufficient to complete the forms.\n\n Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on \"learn more\" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.\n\n H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.\n\n DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC.  You no longer need to enter this information on H&R web site.  I prefer having this information locally on my PC for better security.  The change from web site to local PC was introduced last year and I was happy to see that this change is here to stay.\n\n I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.\n\n I use large font option on my monitor display and in the past years had display issues on some forms (text boxes were display overlapping each other on some forms). This year all forms displayed properly.\n\n I usually purchase tax software as early as possible to help me with end year tax planning. However, if timing is not important to you be aware that the price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter \"Amazon price history alert\" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word camel in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached.  During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $44.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.\n\n For folks trying to download State Forms. The state forms are not available as of 11/17/2013. You have an option of entering email where you will be notified as soon as the form for your state becomes available. Alternatively, you can go to H&R website, click on \"Download Software\" on the top banner, and select \"State Editions\".  Currently it says \"Available in January 2014\".\n\nWhen the state forms will become available they can be downloaded by selecting the State Tab and then clicking on the button labelled \"Buy\" (a little scary since we already paid for it) but then \"buy\" will turn into \"update\" and the forms will be downloaded to your computer.\n\n At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.\n\n Update: To post an answer to a good question asked via a comment:  Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years?\n Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.\n\n Update: Several people asked me via comments if Schedule C is included in Deluxe edition because it is not explicitly mentioned in the description.  Schedule C form is included and covered in the interview.\n\nI have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years.  I keep coming back because it works well for the tax forms I need to do and it is less expensive than TurboTax. If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.\n\nAli Julia review", "summary": "Pleased overall", "unixReviewTime": 1384646400}

I recently bought a new Intel based Mac Mini (2.0 GHz) with 4 GB of RAM, from Amazon. I also got the \"full\" copy of MS Office Mac. I had thought it would be a more fully featured version. But, it is NOT. For about three times the money you get MS Exchange compatibility and two LESS licenses. I really didn't fully understand this at first. Now I do. Unless you absolutely need Exchange in Entourage, there is no need to buy this version. Save the money and get the Home version.  I also need to correct some of my earlier review, which I will quote and amend below.\n\nTo start the installation process, even on the new Mini took forever. I am estimating an hour to no more updates needed. That was quite an ordeal! It really should have been one big update and reboot and done, it was not. It was over and over and over rebooting and updating. Phew!\n\n\"Entourage is the answer to Outlook. It's pretty good as a mail client and contact and appointment organizer. It also successfully synced to my Mobile Me account. It's much slicker than the Mac Mail client but you'd hope it was for a for sale product.  It is nice to have mail contacts and calendar in one program as it belongs. This is the best reason for Entourage, consolidation of the obvious. Apple insists they be separate.\"  Well that was earlier. Now I can't get Mobile Me (which Office continues to call .Mac, really Microsoft?) to properly sync the calendar. This is a major pain! It worked earlier and now it doesn't. I was working earlier on Tiger now I'm on Leopard, is that why? I don't know. I really wanted to use Entourage but now it's useless to me.\n\n\"Excel and Power Point are the more business oriented, apps included in Office. They function well and as expected but on a G4 a little slowly.  Excel provides spreadsheet capabilities and Powerpoint, does presentations. \"  No real changes here these two operate juts fine and as they should.\n\n\"A bonus app is Microsoft Messenger. Readily available on the web, but included in this app for easy installation.\"  Still there and still works, but I wonder how many true Mac people will actually use this client.\n\nOverall a very comprehensive package, but for around $300 it really is overpriced and not worth the extra cost unless you absolutely need Exchange and absolute Office compatibility.  It competes with the free open source office apps like \"Open Office\" and FREE is a compelling price!  It also is the standard by which other office apps are measured and keeps that lead in check. My only reservation is if you have an older Mac, PowerPC based, you will find it too slow.\n\nDay to day operations are quite quick on the new Mini and assume even better on more powerful Macs.  I have to wonder if this version is even needed with Apple building Exchange right into the next OS??", "summary": "Lots of issues here, not good ones", "unixReviewTime": 1245628800}

When Windows XP came out I obtained what I was really expecting, a very solid, stable and enhanceable system.\nWindows XP is based on the Windows 2000 code base with several major multimedia, administrative tools and security enhancements among other things.\nThis is really the closest you can get to a truly standard OS for all types of users, except system administators obviously.  We are getting closer to not having different Windows flavors running around anymore.\nThe acceptance of this OS will gradually relieve developers from having to design multi-platform applications, a major headache in the past.  As of this writing, Windows 95 has almost been phased out, and almost every piece of software is written for Windows XP (Home and Professional)\nI've tested this OS on my personal laptop (Thinkpad T-21) and several Pentium family desktops (P-III 750Mhz and P-IV 2.4Ghz) with many different software and hardware combinations without major issues.  Software drivers are becoming quickly available for all types of hardware.  In terms of software applications, I had to wait a bit longer for a few applications to become XP compatible.\nAs with any OS, the compatibility issues were higher when the OS was released, but now you will not find as many, unless you still own very old pieces of hardware and software.  This is in my opinion the primary factor when deciding wether to upgrade or to stay where you are.\nI will not get into the features of the OS, as they are very well described by Amazon and other reviewers, what I can tell you is what I consider the major highlights of this OS:\n* Great multimedia features - MovieMaker, Media Player.  Windows Explorer has also been expanded with options to manage digital media such as pictures and music.  Multimedia devices are installed and configured easier than ever\n* CD Burning options built in - Creating a music or data CD is as easy as drag and drop.  It may not be the most efficient burning system, but its a good place to start\n* Administrative Tools - The Disk administrator, along with the disk defragmenter are two enhanced tools that I rely on with XP\n* Windows Update - Microsoft has been updating the OS frequently with many security fixes and tools updates and enhancements. You can set up XP to update your system periodically\n* Networking - Setting up a network is much easier now.  A firewall is also built in as part of the network security features new in XP\n* System Help - The help tool has been enhanced to search not only locally on the PC but through the Internet as well.  General Help Topics are very detailed and descriptive with many illustrations.  Great improvement here.\n* Wizards - Many more settings are performed with wizards.  Is like filling an electronic questionnaire, then XP takes over the rest of the configuration steps based on your answers.\nAnd simply the looks.  Icons are more colorful, and they take  advantage of higher end video cards with more color options.  You can select display settings to look like the old Windows or the new XP look.\nIn terms of performance, I admit that Windows by design, does not consider low end machines and it may seem slow on low RAM machines.  I would definitely recommend having more than 256MB of RAM and a high end Pentium processor (P3 and up) for acceptable performance.  Fortunately, there are options to tweak performance settings by eliminating the sometimes unnecessary display effects.\nI think at this time, you may be assured that Windows XP will be the best choice for you.  Don't hesitate to buy it, taking into consideration the points I mentioned above.\nRecommended", "summary": "A solid operating system", "unixReviewTime": 1043107200}

Another, is the need to buy a \"full version\" every year.  Seems to me, once you buy TurboTax, you could pay a lower fee each year to upgrade to the next year's version.  Finally, there are situations such as mine where I live in a state with no income tax, yet to get the version I need, there are only versions with the State Income Tax software included.

This program does not hog system resources. In addition, for the most part it does not require any configuration. It installs in a snap, and maintains itself well.\n\nOne drawback that I have experienced is that when the software does find something, it can be pretty aggressive about notifying you about it, even if the \"threat\" is small. For example, my computer has tracking cookies in my browser for sites that use them. I don't need them to be deleted, so when Norton 360 notifies me about them, I usually choose to ignore them. When I select \"ignore\" in the program, a few minutes later, the security alert will pop up again. This happens a few times when I am using my computer, or when I wake it up from Hibernation. It is not a deal breaker by any means, but it is unnecessarily annoying.\n\nThis program also has the ability to set itself up for automatically backing up your sensitive data to a specified place on your computer or on an external hard drive. You can do this manually or set up an automatic schedule. The tuneup feature maintains your computer in good running shape.\n\nThis software is great.

When finally 10.5.2 arrived I began using it. It fixes many Leopard bugs. According to some websites, at least 130 bugs have been fixed. This is important since many problems with third party software may be related to other software or to the operating system. For example, Apple is aware of problems with its Sync services and Core Image. Also, some bugs have existed for many years and have not been fixed, such as a potential bug when moving data to an external device.\nKeeping these issues in mind I did a completely clean install of Leopard 10.5.2 in a brand new hard drive.\nI installed Office 2008 as well as the available upgrade to 12.0.1.\n\nFirst Impressions:\nSome useful features have been added, such as Elements Gallery, which may be a time saver for many people. Some features have been removed, such as VBA, and this may be a deal-breaker for many people.\nI'm keeping Office 2004 in a separate partition in order to use previous versions of Word and Excel.\nAt the same time, I can still use the new versions when I don't need the VBA features.\nLack of VBA support was announced well over a year ago, so this came as no surprise.\n\nStarting up:\nEach program took approximately 10 seconds to launch. Office seems to have a peculiar way of handling fonts, though, and launch times can be greatly effected. After installing another program that installed more fonts, and installing Extensis Fusion to manage my fonts, launch times for Office programs was approximately 150 (one hundred and fifty) seconds, instead of the original 10 (ten) seconds.\nNow it takes about a minute to launch these programs. In all fairness, the slow down is partly caused by third party software.\n\nOverall (and very brief)  impressions:\nPowerPoint works with presentations that used to crash my 2004 version. The 2004 version was practically unusable for me. This was a welcome upgrade.\n\nExcel works fine and the Elements Gallery is a good addition. It lost VBA support and the Abalysys Toolpack. I kept the 2004 version as well.\n\nWord seems to be a solid upgrade. Some third party templates do not work with 2008, so I kept Word 2004.\n\nEntourage works very well. I had to re-select the folders that I had set up for my rules, and re-apply categories to my folders. Syncing with Address Book always adds many duplicate contacts. Fortunately there are scripts to deal with this inconvenience. Hyperlinks still require a workaround, as mentioned by another reviewer. I would not rate Office with 1-star solely based on that issue.\n\nExpression Media used to be called iView MediaPro, iView Multimedia, and iView many years ago. It used to be a $25 shareware program when I first used it. Eventually it became quite expensive so I never upgraded until I received this version. So far I'm happy with it. It has worked fine for cataloging thousands of fonts and pictures, and I'm entitled to a free upgrade when version 2 comes out.\n\nPrice:\nThere are free Office alternatives, as well as iWork. I( still prefer Microsoft Office for the most part. The only exception may be Keynote 4.\nMicrosoft offered a substantial discount under the names of The Technology Guarantee Program and the Super Suite Deal. Additionally, for one day they offered a $[...] rebate. So users could get the Mac Special Media Edition for approximately $[...]-$[...] with these offers.\nHad it not been for the offer, I would have stayed with Office 2004. I've used Office 2008 for a few days, every day, and so far have encountered no problems.\n\nOverall I'm satisfied with the upgrade. Support has been great, both by Microsoft and the MVP people. Search their forums and you'll find a lot of useful advise.", "summary": "Interesting update to Office 2004", "unixReviewTime": 1205798400}

Microsoft decided to no longer include Windows Media Center as part of Windows 8.  So if you buy this and decide that you want to have a home entertainment pc, you would have to buy the Windows Pro Pack for 99 bucks just to get Windows Media Center.  If you buy Windows 8.1 Pro, you can get Windows Media Center for 10 bucks extra.\n\nIf you already have a version of Windows 7, you would be better off to simply install it on your computer rather than this.  If you are updating from Windows XP, I recommend that you find a Windows 7 Upgrade package rather than install Windows 8.1 on your computer. Microsoft has stopped selling Windows 7 upgrades (because they were out-selling Windows 8), so you may have to buy a Windows 7 OEM version to do a clean install of Windows 7 on your computer.  Windows 7 comes with Windows Media Center as part of the operating system and has an interface well suited for use on a standard non-touch screen computer.\n\nWith Windows 8.1, you now get a start button, but the start menu is still not back.  Even more important than the lack of a start menu, you can either have the tiles or an awkward stripped-down desktop choice.  Microsoft still has not realized that a computer is most productive with an operating system designed for a mouse and keyboard interface and that a tablet and a phone come with a touch screen and work best with a touch interface.  The all in one approach will make some power users and early adapters happy, but an every day user who just wants to run multiple applications in actual windows (instead of awkward full-screen apps), including MS Office, email, and dozens of other programs will be much happier with Windows 7.\n\nWindows 8.1 is a bit friendlier than Windows 8, but it is still an operating system that gives the user an awkward desktop interface instead of a classic start menu and takes away the valuable feature of Windows Media Center only to charge you an additional 99 dollars to get it back by buying Windows 8 Pro Pack.\n\nUPDATED INFORMATION: Below are quotes from a CNET review of Windows 8.1 concerning the tiles, the start button and the classic Windows 7 interface as well as their observation about Windows 7 vs Windows 8.1:\n\n\"The split between the touch-friendly tiles and throwback desktop mode is still awkward, and the OS is hard to use without a touch screen. While welcome, the new Start button doesn't behave like the classic version...\"\n\n\"What you're left with is an OS that still feels like an awkward compromise between the traditional \"desktop\" Windows and the touch-centric, tablet-optimized future that looks and feels exactly like Windows Phone.\"\n\n\"If you have a legacy Windows 7 system and haven't taken the Windows 8 plunge yet, there's still no reason to.\"\n\nFull review is at [...]\n\nIf Microsoft were to restore the option for the classic start menu and include Windows Media Center as part of the operating system, I would be inclined to recommend Windows 8.1 as an operating system that I would use.  However, in its current state, I must agree with CNET that if you have a legacy Windows 7 system and haven't taken the Windows 8 plunge yet, there is still no compelling reason to do so based on the changes in Windows 8.1.\n\nUPDATE December 3, 2013:  As of November 30th, here is the breakdown of Microsoft operating systems in use:\n\n*Windows 7  46.64 percent of pc's\n*Windows XP  31.22 percent of pc's\n*Windows 8  6.66 percent of pc's\n*Windows Vista  3.57 percent of pc's\n*Windows 8.1  2.64 percent of pc's\n\nWindows 8.1 is faster and has some improved security features over Windows 7. However, as you can see, even Windows Vista has a larger installed share of the market than Windows 8.1 as of November 30, 2013.  Windows customers are waiting for Microsoft to give them a choice of whether they want to use the tablet (tiled) interface or a fully functioning desktop O/S complete with a start menu as an option.\n\nAlthough Windows 8.1 made some improvements and I could tolerate it (however awkward it might be), I am staying with Windows 7 because it already includes a friendly desktop with Start Menu and Windows Media Center for recording live tv.  Why should customers lose functionality or incur additional expenses with Windows 8?\n\nThe rejection of Windows 8 and 8.1 has gotten so bad that sources say Microsoft is finally talking about bringing back the start menu in Windows 8.2.  See \"Microsoft may finally bring back full Start menu with Windows 8.2\"\n\n[...]\n\nComputer manufacturers have become so disgusted with the whole Windows 8 and 8.1 mess that they are now talking about selling computers that run both Windows 8 and Android. (Note: this can't be good news for Microsoft!) See \"PC makers plan rebellion against Windows at 2014 CES, analysts say.\"\n\n[...]\n\nMy predictions are that we will also see an end to Windows RT.  There will be a desktop Windows 8.(something) and a Windows 8 Phone.  One or the other is going to end up on Microsoft tablets.  Right now there are full versions of Windows 8.1 running on tablets, so it should be interesting to see which O/S runs on Windows tablets in the future.", "summary": "It would be a mistake to buy this!", "unixReviewTime": 1382054400}

My needs are very specific to that purpose and I made no effort to see how strong the software was for such things as burning discs or importing various formats from video cameras.\n\nFirst, let's start with the positives.  One thing I have to credit this software with is that it does encode faster than my current solution. For starters, it is 64 bit software so if your operating system is also 64 bits and you have a healthy amount of RAM then it will put it to work.  I also believe (although can't test) that the program is efficient in its approach to encoding because it really does seem to move along at a good clip even compared to other 64 bit software I've tried.\n\nAnother plus is that if you want to record voice-over audio the process is intuitive and easy.  This is fairly common in similar packages but I've seen much worse implementations.  I'd also say that for very simple tasks, the interface is fairly intuitive (considering it's a program with many, many features and that complexity will always come with a learning curve).\n\nThings I didn't like?  For starters, it copies any video file that I want to edit to another location.  I understand that it does this to allow for non-destructive editing but I vastly prefer my current software's solution of tracking the changes in very small files of its own making and then applying them during the encoding process.  PowerDirector forces me to significantly increase the space on my hard drive devoted to video and I frequently have too much in the pipeline to want to do that.\n\nAnother issue I had was the method for cutting out pieces of the video.  I routinely edit files that already include speech.  When I pull out a sentence, or even just a long pause between speaking, I want to check not just the clip I'm pulling out, but the start of the clip after the cut so I can make sure the transition is smooth.  As best I can tell, this is impossible until after I've made the cut. There were actually a lot of little things like this that made the process of doing small edits spread out over a 30 minute video a real pain.  For example, it would often bounce back to the beginning of the project after I did virtually anything at all which would force me to find my place again.\n\nPerhaps my biggest gripe is that for some strange reason the program would intermittently struggle to render text.  Whether it was text capture in the game video or titles that PowerDirector itself put in, it would sometimes render it very jagged as if the video was low resolution... yet the other video elements were fine.  I never could determine the cause, it was too sporadic to determine a root cause but this was a total deal-breaker for me.  I'm simply not willing to risk that at random points in a video, the quality will be bad.\n\nThis is a tough product to rate because I feel like a lot of my problems with PowerDirector are more a case of it not fitting my personal needs rather than being poorly designed software.  The text issue is bad, but I don't want to hammer it too hard for one thing.  Ultimately, I hope people won't use my star rating, but rather look at the things that caused me problems and ask yourself if they matter for your purposes.  In the end, the increased time and aggravation that editing in PowerDirector outweighed the faster encode times (which matter less to me since I can walk away and come back later).  But your mileage could definitely vary depending on the use you'd like to put it to.", "summary": "Didn't fit my needs", "unixReviewTime": 1390262400}

I recently helped my brother setup Dragon Naturally Speaking Premium  12 a while after he purchased it. I'll focus on the differences between the two.\n\nWith both installation on Windows 7 Pro was painless. The initial setup of 12 wanted you to do the training step which involves reading several pages from a publication. These are internal to the Dragon setup with several good selections. With 13 much of this is optional, but still improves accuracy and helps Dragon learn you writing style.\n\nDragon profile setup may be tedious, but I think it's worth it for the improved results.\n\nIn Dragon 13 literature there are 14 new or improved features:\n1) 15% greater accuracy: I'm not sure how such a definitive number, but I believe it's improved.\n\n2) Learning from sent email works with web clients now:\n  I don't use the supported web mail clients - I'm an Outlook gal.\n\n3) There is a new Dragon Vocabulary editor:\n  I have not tried this yet. I'll share my experience when I update this again later.\n\n4) Smart Format Rules Enhancement:\n  I think 13 is learning my common usage and adapting. This is kind of subtle and I can't really tell yet if it's better than 12.\n\n5) Faster Than Ever:\n  13 does seem a little faster to me but it's hard to tell on different machines with different characteristics. My brother's PC with 12 is an older core duo and has 6GB. Mine is a newer core i7 with 16GB. It seems fast enough to me. 13 is supposed to evaluate the resources of a system and adapt Dragon to make the best use of even limited resources.\n\nEasier setup is via several changes in requirements and the audio setup. All to remove or make optional steps that were included in the Dragon 12 setup. This makes it faster to get started but all three of these improve quality.\n\n6) With 13 Dragon assigns a name to profiles:\n  To name a profile you need to rename it later. In 12 you were asked for the name when creating the profile.\n\n7) The somewhat tedious reading for 4 minutes isn't required any more:\n  It does improve accuracy. My vision impaired brother struggled with reading the selection from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and it took us nearly an hour to get through it. When we were done Dragon did very well with his distinct \"Down East\" Maine accent. While it's not required in 13 I think it made a noticeable improvement.\n\n8) Dragon 13 no longer asks to adapt its vocabulary with documents/email at profile creation:\n  This saves time but, again it is a step that benefits overall use at a less convenient startup. Document/email analysis can be done later.\n\n9) Dragon 13 audio setup lets you just pick your input device:\n  I used the headset that came with Dragon Dragon Naturally Speaking Premium  which works very well. 13 also works pretty well with my laptop's built-in noise cancelling microphone which 12 didn't support. I don't even recall the microphone setup steps on 12 so I think they must have been almost as easy. I'm happy to see support for the open source OpenOffice Writer V4.1.\n\n10) The microphone check step is a short reading:\n  Again I don't recall this step on 12 though I'm sure it was there too.\n\n11) Dragon 13 has increased its support of web based applications:\n  Support has been added for web applications like Gmail and added commands and support for all major browsers. I have not explored this too much yet. I'll update this review when I've learned more. Dragon is very impressive to me in the amount of voice control it readily provides.\n\n12) The DragonBar has been redesigned in 13:\n  If you have 12 and want to go back to the \"classic\" bar it's in there and supported. I like the way it autocollapses so it does not use more screen space than needed.\n\n13) The Dragon Sidebar is now the Learning Center:\n  Whatever they call it I like having it around as I am continuing to learn Dragon. They way it adapts to the context of the currently open application is clever and very helpful.\n\n14) The interactive tutorial has been expanded:\n  It now covers the Dragon bar, learning center and the Vocabulary Editor. I think the tutorials are pretty good, but I just jumped in head first. In 12 my brother tried the tutorial simulation. It was well intentioned but the tutorial didn't understand his accent. Seems the tutorials do not use the just created profile. They are there for those who want/need them and that's a very good thing.\n\nSo far I'm liking Dragon 13 with the included headset. It's a complex program with many aspects I hope to try and dig into as I find time to get beyond my present basic use. These include using the dictation transcription capability which I hope to use with the iPhone app.\n\nDragon isn't perfect - sometimes it can seem to get confused when I stumble over some words, and this can result in dictated text that is hilarious! When this happens and I try to continue while laughing the results can get even more funny to the point where I have to stop and walk away and regain my composure before continuing. Somehow I've come to really like those fairly rare times takes me into a laughing fit. I can't think of another program where I look forward to it going off the rails like this.\n\nIt seems to me that 13 appears more an incremental improvement over 12 than a revolutionary upgrade. If I had 12 instead of my brother I would probably just kept it. If you need the expanded applications control or need more flexible microphone capability then 13 may be a good move even from 12.\n\nBecause it's the standard at what it does and I've had no problems with it I'm giving  Dragon Naturally Speaking Premium  13 Five stars.", "summary": "THE Choice for Speech Recognition.

No grammar, no lessons, etc. Just immerse the student in the language the way a baby is immersed. To be honest, I wasn't aware of that philosophy when I decided to try this out.\nThe technique is certainly interesting. They do a good job of showing you pictures many times and making you pronounce the word. This package comes with a mic and headphone, although I only used the mic. But when you speak back, the software tells you how well you pronounced the word. That's pretty neat. But occasionally it can get annoying if you think you've pronounced the word correctly and it still says you haven't! For each word they also have a training session so that you can practice just the pronunciation of that word.\nOne other 'feature' that I didn't like was that they always take you through a review when you start a new session (after having previously finished a session and then closed the software). There is a way to disable that review, but they'll always remind you about it later on and mark it as remaining to do!\nIn all fairness, if the goal is to learn a language, this software does a good job of that. Just don't expect to learn it quick. It is meant to take a long time, just as a baby takes a long time to eventually communicate with others.

In them, Nancy Drew, the college-aged female detective, explores mysteries and finds solutions to various puzzles.\nYou can see the various improvements in this latest entry. The graphics are much smoother, and as you turn around in a given area the 'snapshot' quality is more of a flow. It's still not a fully immersive environment - in essence you go \"to\" a spot and then can turn left or right through set images of the room. You can point to a \"hot spot\" in the room to approach an item or examine it. Still, in a way this makes it easier for younger detectives to know what to do. If you can't click on something, it's not important.\nThere's no violence or blood, although I do have to comment that the ghost dogs are rather scary! I have had younger teenage girls refuse to play some of the games I've lent them because they were too scary after a few hours. This one might fall into that category if you have a skittish nature. The dogs don't actually attack you, but their jumping on the doors, howling and rattling the house can be quite frightning.\nThe game uses very logical puzzles that actually teach you things. You want to test water from a well, but first you have to learn the real technique for priming a pump and do it. You need to use a motorboat, but the pistons aren't in the proper cycle positions. Anyone who uses a boat would see this by looking at the engine, and they helpfully include a diagram to show you (i.e. Nancy) how to fix this before the engine will work. Notes at the ranger station warn you about Hantavirus, a real danger if you're cleaning areas where mice live.\nThere are other puzzles - identifying birds, finding planks to get over rotten floorboards and so on - that fit in as well. In general the game does an admirable job of keeping the game very realistic-feeling, like you're really at this Pennsylvanian lake, amongst the locals there, exploring their world.\nOn the downside, much of the game involves pony-trail sorts of handoffs. You know you need a spark plug. You might think it would be lying around nearby or that one would be in the house. But instead, searching all over creation finds none. Instead, you have to go to sleep, wake up at night, chat with someone who it so happens has one, go back to sleep again, and then in the morning use it. It can get extremely frustrating when at many times in the game you know what you *need* but just have to figure out how the game designers think you should *get* it.\nStill, many times this means that your gameplay time is stretched out as you wander around, explore, chat with people, and enjoy the world. It's not a game for people who want to race through to the end to have 'beaten it'. If you poke at a walkthrough site, you can probably do so in an hour or two. Instead, it's a game that, for a relatively low price, lets you wander through a well realized world, exercise those \"little grey cells\" in your brain, and really become knowledgeable about a number of intersting subjects.

Once the paperwork is scanned, PaperPort allows you to easily collate, stack, and rearrange your pages just as you would with paper documents. PaperPort does have one major advantage over keeping your paperwork in a physical filing cabinet -- its OCR technology can recognize the text in your scanned documents so that you can conduct a search for a specific document simply by using a word (or several words) in the document you're searching for.\n\nPros\n----\n- Virtual Desktop\nThe Graphical User Interface is a lot like Windows. The left pane displays your Folders in a Tree Structure and the right pane displays the files in the active folder. Like Windows Explorer, you can choose to view your files as Large Icons, Small Icons, List, Details, or Thumbnails. I find the Thumbnails view (default) most useful because it not only shows the image of your file, it allows you to \"flip\" the pages on the thumbnail by clicking its forward and backward arrow. Nice! This makes working in PaperPort feel like working in a virtual desktop environment.\n\n- OCR Reasonably Good\nThe OCR is about 85% - 90% accurate most of the time. This could be a \"con\" for some people because they may expect a higher accuracy. Personally, I think the accuracy is reasonably good. The OCR will work even when the scan resolution is at 150 dpi (the lower resolution allows much quicker scanning than the standard/recommended 300 dpi), although the accuracy may diminish slightly as a result.\n\n- Scanning Niceties\nI love the Auto Straighten feature. With Auto Straighten, you just place the document to be scanned on your flatbed without worrying about whether it's on straight because the app straightens the final scan for you. You also have the option of erasing any of the edges. You get to specify how much of the edge(s) to remove (in inches or mm). This is a handy feature for removing, say, 3-hole punch marks from the edge of the paper.\n\n- Manipulate PDF Files\nYou can annotate PDF by typing notes (using either the note tool or textbox tool), highlighting, underlining, or drawing/scribbling (using the pencil tool). You can even fill out PDF forms or create your own form fields.\n\nCons\n----\n- User Interface A Little Non-Intuitive\nThe user interface is a little non-intuitive. For example, the All-in-One Search will only search for items in the active directory and sub-directories. The only way to specify which directory to search is to first change the active directory. (As you adjust to how the software works, it gets easier however.)\n\n- Cumbersome Scanning\nThe scanning module allows you to create scan profiles (each saved profile is a set of customized scan settings) so you can quickly change settings between scans. That's all well and good, but the convenience is negated by the number of steps it takes to scan a set of documents:\n\nFirst, you have to click on the scan button, which brings up a dialog. Then you have to click scan again on that dialog. After scanning, you have to close the dialog and click done on the main window, at which point another dialog pops up asking you to name the scanned output. Click done again to omit naming the file. Tooo...ooo many steps just to get something scanned!\n\n- Quirks\nThe software has some quirks. Here are a couple of examples (number in parenthesis indicates severity of problem on a scale of 1-5):\n\n(1) After an unsuccessful search, the app will ask whether you want to re-index your folder. If you answer yes, it goes into this \"preparing to index...\" mode and nothing seems to happen. The workaround is to simply invoke the indexing yourself by right-clicking on the folder in the Folders Tree and selecting \"Add to All-in-One Search.\"\n\n(3) The scrolling of PDF files is choppy and slow (using either the scroll bar or the hand tool). I compared the scrolling to Adobe Acrobat 9.3 and the scrolling in Acrobat is very smooth and *fast*.\n\n- Not All Items Stackable\nThe only items that you can \"stack\" together are PDF (Adobe Acrobat) and MAX (Nuance PaperPort) files. You can't, for example, stack text files, excel files, etc. It would be very useful if PaperPort implemented a Binder (like Microsoft Binder, which was, unfortunately, discontinued after Office 2000).\n\n---\nPaperport 12 is a very helpful tool that can help reduce physical clutter and help you get organized. It is a little quirky at times, but it is a very usable piece of software nonetheless. I would definitely recommend it.", "summary": "Reduce Paper Clutter And Make Your Documents Searchable", "unixReviewTime": 1280448000}

If you filed last year with TurboTax 2012, yes, it is basically the exact same program. But the behind-the-scenes stuff gets updated with new forms and tax laws, etc. I'm sure all of that costs plenty to keep up with, justifying having to re-buy what seems like the same program every year. Though it does beg the question, could we maybe just buy a single TurboTax and pay each year just for the updates and to e-file, instead of re-buying nearly identical software, and a new box and disc and updated marketing, etc. But I digress.\n\nI file Married Filing Jointly and have a pretty simple tax situation (wife and I each have one job, no kids, standard deduction). And for this purpose it was EXTREMELY easy and simple to file. I've used TurboTax since 2011, and I really like how it imports the previous year and unless anything major has changed, you basically just swap some numbers around and you are DONE! I probably spent less than 10 minutes importing my 2012 return and updating it for 2013. Since I've used TurboTax for the last 3 years, it also shows you a tax history with your history of income and taxes. It's kind of fun to see a trendline over the years, especially if it is (hopefully) in the upward direction.\n\nWhat I also like, is switching back and forth between the \"hold my hand' version of the software and the raw tax forms. Some of the questions and situations TurboTax asks me about, I am curious what actual tax basis there is to the question. So after I fill it out, I switch to the forms and see exactly which fields on which forms are being populated based on my answers. It can help you understand tax filing much better to actually look at all the forms being submitted rather than relying solely on the user-friendly walkthrough version. But if that stuff doesn't interest you, it seems accurate and reliable enough to not really need to fret too much over it either.\n\nMake sure you look at the difference between the TurboTax versions (Basic, Deluxe, Premier, Home & Business) so you don't leave tax deductions/credits on the table. Deluxe was what I needed, but depending on your situation it may benefit you to pay a little extra for the pricier ones. If you have a pretty simple tax situation and could file a 1040EZ, the cheapest basic one could be all you need. If you are self-employed, own a business, trade stocks, I would look into the Premier or Home & Business options.\n\nIf you are new to TurboTax and will not have anything to import from last year, it takes a little longer, but it is still pretty quick to enter everything in. I could maybe do mine from scratch in 20 minutes. Granted, many people have all kinds of deductions and credits or self-employment details (or if you bought/sold real estate or stocks etc.) that could drastically lengthen the time it takes to go through the process. But all I know, is for me personally, this product is simple, thorough, and exactly what I needed. I fully intend to purchase TurboTax again next tax year.\n\nFYI: The IRS will not process returns in 2014 for tax year 2013 until after January 31st, so don't feel too rushed to buy this and file immediately, as you will still need to wait until *at least* February for any possible refund.", "summary": "If you've used TurboTax before, you know what to expect.", "unixReviewTime": 1388966400}

Didn't happen. iMovie is now worse than ever. Editing audio files is probably the most frustrating thing I've tried in a while. The interface is not designed well, and I found myself looking for features that used to be there (fade out video effect in conjunction with audio fade out) thinking they've got got to be there somewhere, and then finding out that they simply don't exist.\n\nIMPORTANT: If you install iMovie 09, it will make your existing install of iMovie HD UNUSABLE. You CANNOT keep your old installation of iMovie 06HD when you install iMovie 09! This is amazingly frustrating, especially sine iMovie 09 will not open iMovie 06 video files!\n\nI honestly think they don't want to make iMovie 09 work the way it should to force people to buy the much more expensive Final Cut, even if you don't need all of the features of a full video editing software. Working with HD video in iMovie is a joke; it lags, stutters, and crashes for no apparent reason.\n\niPhoto is fine, but the new features are not that impressive. The face recognition would be awesome if it worked well, but it doesn't. It wanted to group my grandmother and my sister together (I guess there is a little family resemblance there). The GPS feature is awesome if you have a GPS enabled camera, but if you have a camera that nice you're probably using a proffesional image editing software. Eventually (next 2-3 years) as consumer cameras start to have built in GPS, this feature will be valuable, so I guess you could say iPhoto is ahead of its time.\n\nGarage Band works like it should, but there aren't any improvements that make it worth upgrading. The much flaunted lessons must be bought and downloaded, they don't come with the software. It is useful certainly, but I just don't see anything that makes me believe upgrading is worth it.\n\nFrankly, this is just another ho-hum release. You don't need to upgrade unless you just have to have GPS photo tracking or face recognition software. If you were hoping (like me) that iMovie would be more robust, think again. It would have been very easy for Apple to include two versions of iMovie: advanced and basic. Basic would be the default setting and advanced would include the features lost from the 06 version. It could be turned on or off for the best of both worlds. Instead I have iMovie HD installed on top of iLife 09. Waste of hard drive space.\n\niLife 09 doesn't offer any compelling reason to update if you have iLife 08. There aren't any improvement that are not relatively minor or obscure (face recognition for example). And there is one MASSIVE disadvatage, at least for those who prefer iMovie 06: installing iMovie 09 will cause iMovie 06 to become inoperable! You have no choice in the matter, and no prompt lets you know that you are losing iMovie HD by installing iLife 09. It just happens.\n\nWhy Apple doesn't allow the user to control how many or few features are available is beyond me. I'm not saying everyone should want all the features from iMovie 06, but for those of us that do, why not make them available? This sort of 'one size fits all' approach is really frustrating.", "summary": "iMovie09 will kill your installation of imovie HD! The rest of the programs are ho-hum", "unixReviewTime": 1233532800}

You can call up any palette from the Lagoon, adjust colors, pens, sizes, undo errors, and pretty much perform anything available in the program from the Lagoon.  It can also be customized any way you wish.  There are a wide array of brushes and tools available for use.  You can even customize existing brushes, import brushes, or create a whole new brush. Within an hour and without any tutorials or difficulty, I was drawing and exporting cartoons into Photoshop where I balanced and evened everything out for that polished look.  I then exported to base photos to use with Comic Life.  I love the flexibility the tablet gives me.  I also love the fact that this program exports to Photoshop, so you can clean any rough edges and jazz it up even more.

Each time I get the message: \"Attention! The current project was saved automatically. However, internal memory structures may be damaged that do not enable correct saving. It is recommended that the movies are saved with new names for further editing. <Continue program> <Close program>.\"\n\nAlthough I'm given the options to \"continue program\" or \"close program\" the program doesn't respond to clicks on either option. Right-clicking the Windows taskbar to \"Close window\" doesn't do any good either. The only thing that works is the \"End task\" function in Task Manager.\n\nThe user interface is unintuitive. Examples: (1) the drag-and-drop to add media is limited to a tiny column in the timeline interface. I found this out only by trial and error. (2) Drag-and-drop of effects (like transition) results in the effect being applied to the beginning of the clip, not where you drop the effect. (3) I haven't found a way to apply the effects to just a part of the clip and not the entire clip. I was sure there's a way, which was why I consulted the help function, which brings me to the next point.\n\nThe antiquated Help user interface looks like something from Windows NT. That's not my real beef however. What I have a problem with is the help information doesn't direct you to the navigational breadcrumb you can follow to perform the function you're seeking help on. For example, a search on how to rotate a movie results in information on how to set the angle of rotation, how to set the rotational axis, etc. but nothing on how one might navigate one's way through the layers of navigational menus and buttons to access the rotate function.\n\nThis next point I'm bringing up is a BIG problem. The thumbnails on the timeline is so small I can't make out what part of the video each thumbnail corresponds to. They might as well not be there at all. Inserting or overlaying an effect or sound at a precise location without the aid of [usable] thumbnails is a real pain!\n\nI want to be fair and provide a balanced view of this program.

Although I usually like the dark ones the least, something about this game was very gravitational. When I first started it, little did I know that not only I'd actually like it even a little, but I'd write a somewhat decent review on it.\n\nStory: 7.5/10. Orginially, Nancy shows up at Blackmoor Manor, a massive mansion in England, to find out what is wrong with newlywed Linda Penvellyn, who won't show her face or communicate with anyone, with the exception of a few words. Upon Nancy's arrival, weird things start happening fast, and it's clear that there's either a supernatual being in the residency, or someone really doesn't want Nancy there. The Penvellyn family is HUGE, and it was considerably fascinating to uncover more and more history.\n\nGraphics/Setting: 7.5/10. The characters are still robotic at this point in the series, but they're slowly improving. Since you stay indoors the whole time (which was a negative aspect for me), you got to really see the detail in the mansion, but boy is there a lot. The manor makes you feel very small, and it's full of a lot of surprises and secrets waiting to be uncovered.\n\nCharacters: 7/10. The characters were considerably good this time around. To name a few, there's the intentionally nice but slightly irritating girl Jane, the hired author, Nigel who's writing a Penvellyn memoir, and Mrs. Drake, a strict and uptight lady. There's also Loulou the parrot, who's helpful and funny, but annoying at times.\n\nPuzzles: 7/10. Even though I had to use a walkthrough for almost all of the puzzles, they still took a long time to get done. They really got you to think, but to the point where you're cranium hurt! I think this game sort of over-did the puzzles because they're soooo many. This isn't called the hardest Nancy Drew game for nothing.\n\nActivities: 5/10. There isn't anything really to do outside of the story progression, which I found very dissapointing. I realize that the point of these games is to sleuth and solve mysteries, but fun activities are a priority in my book, and this game just didn't have any.\n\nEnding: 7/10. Maybe the most simple ending yet in the series. Somewhat surprising as well.\n\nTotal: 7.33, rounded to the final score of....\n\n7.5/10.\n\nWhile I may be a tad biased because I don't usually enjoy the darker games, this game does deserve a purchase for many Nancy Drew PC fans, but I'd go with something else for now.", "summary": "Curse of Blackmoor Manor review.", "unixReviewTime": 1313798400}

It is compatible with earlier versions of Wordperfect (going back to Wordperfect 8).\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Corel-WordPerfect-Suite-8/dp/B0006PJAZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Corel WordPerfect Suite 8</a>\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/WordPerfect-6-0-for-Windows/dp/B000HOEDVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">WordPerfect 6.0 for Windows</a>\n\nThe program is very stable Corel has not added significantly new features since 1999. This makes Wordperfect 17/X7 the ninth \"service pack\"  of Wordperfect 8 and the eleventh patch since WP 6. Corel has done almost nothing to keep this product up to date with the current needs of offices around the world. Naturally, this means that this is a very stable, well-tested application. This version of Wordperfect allows you to export a file as a PDF document but has no other features for PDF use. It cannot even produce an ebook unless you convert your file to HTML and, from there, convert it to MOBI or epub. I guess you get what you pay for. If you are not very wealthy, you will have to settle for this bare-bones version. I am very glad I bought this.\n\nOther editions of WordPerfect (standard, legal and Professional)have their own problems (or interesting characteristics). WordPerfect's \"legal edition\" is similar MS Word, legal edition plus the free legal templates from the Microsoft website. Mind you, I really don't like digging through the mountains of templates on the Office website. I like the pleading expert in the Standard and Professional editions of this software.\nHere are some \"free,\" \"kind of compatible\" applications. You get what you pay for.\n\nOpenoffice and Libreoffice\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Apache-OpenOffice-4-0-1-Open-Source-Download/dp/B008XAXAC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Apache OpenOffice 4.0.1 [Open Source Download</a>]\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/LibreOffice-v4-3-for-PC-Open-Source-Download/dp/B00PT6GQY4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">LibreOffice v4.3 for PC [Open Source Download</a>]\n\nare both free and yet have more PDF features (import, export) than this edition of WP Office.\n\n Still, I feel strangely attracted to this simple, reliable program. Somehow, it just feels right! The menu system (though ancient-looking  compared Word's ribbon interface) is comfortable and well organized. Much can be accomplished with keybindings and macros written with \"PerfectScript.\" If you remember the keybindings from the early versions of Wordperfect, you be glad to see that they are still here.\n\nThe much hailed \"reveal codes\" has been superseded by Word's \"reveal formatting\" feature and is no longer a selling point. Religious arguments aside, Wordperfect relies on the faithfulness of long-time users rather than attracting newcomers who might breathe life into Corel as well as this office suite.\n\nThe secondary program in this Suite is the legendary Quattro Pro 17 (also the ninth service pack of Quattro Pro 8, released in 1998). I feel it is a very serviceable, though basic, spreadsheet. Corel inherited the program from Borland and it has never caught the attention and love that Wordperfect has\n\nAnother significant element of this office suite is WordPerfect Lightning--essentially a spinoff of Microsoft's OneNote. It is a note-taking and file sorting application that  helps the user organize all of his/her documents and files (adding notes and classifications if desired).\n\nQuattro Pro is a former product of the Borland Company meant to compete with IBM's release of  Lotus 1-2-3 3.0 in 1989. At the time, it was slightly superior to 1-2-3, but with the sale to Corel in 1994, it has remained very stable (as in unchanged and undeveloped) and only gets occasional patches from Corel. It has changed little since the 1990's.\n\nQuattro pro has moderate support for computing linear matrix transformations (i.e. computing a Fourier transform and other linear algebra applications for scientists and engineers)). This is one of the things that Quattro has over Excel. On the other hand, Excel has forged ahead with new features while Corel has maintained the original features of Borland's original Quattro Pro\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Quattro-Pro-version-5-0-for-Windows-3-1/dp/B000GGVI5O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Quattro Pro version 5.0 for Windows 3.1</a>.\n\nBe careful with this purchase if you depend on Excel compatibility for your employment or work-related applications.\n\nThese (version 17) programs have \"improved\" compatibility with MS Office but are still not perfectly compatible. It helps to be familiar with these programs.\n\nHowever, being \"kind of compatible\" with MS Office will not please many employers and could reduce your chances of getting a job where computer skills are required. Do check out LibreOffice and consider it as a helper program for WordPerfect and Quattro. Since Wordperfect does not feature an email or scheduling program, please consider using the free-to-download Mozilla Thunderbird. I know, this is a great handicap but it is fixable and is a fairly decent imitation of Outlook and other PIM applications.\n\nI love this program and probably always will but its relevance as a competitive office product seems to diminish with every new version. WordPerfect 8 was fantastic. This point release is only slightly better after 9 new versions. It should be called \"WordPerfect 8.9\" because that it is truly the 9th revision of the excellent WordPerfect 8.\n\n Corel needs more users so the program can be improved and developed. I recommend this program to newcomers if only to get some cash flow into Corel so they will continue to make it and support it with updates. Highly recommended.

My crew and I primarily operate MacBooks so our options for software are limited.  With the opportunity to try out Corel Graphic Suite X7 I handed the trials over to our artist/token PC user since X7 operates on Windows only and, so far, we've been impressed with his work while he's been intrigued over the ease of use and complete control over what he does.\n\nThe first thing we noticed is that the software doesn't require much in terms of system requirements so our friend with a relatively older PC was able install and utilize it with no issues.  It ran smoothly and was amplified by the fact that it's user-interface is very intuitive (has features where an artist would want them to be rather than require a treasure hunt to find) and user-friendly.  This saves a lot of time on production since no one likes to navigate through endless menus to find one simple feature.\n\nAfter a week of playing around with the features our artists sent in his first samples and the results are nice.  Granted we're doing this for a youtube page and website, which the software seems grossly overqualified for, but it allowed our guy to crank out images and samples like none other and we're very impressed with the output.\n\nHowever, one of the issues we ran into were that not all of us can read Corel images without sufficient patches, which weren't a problem but goes to show that one must be ready for PC-Mac interfacing if you're running any kind of business/project with a diverse collection of computers.\n\nAll in all, I can't say if X7 is better than Adobe or Photoshop, which are used by most professionals I know in the industry, but we're happy with it on our lower end of the spectrum as we inch our way upward.

With this X4 version, Corel continues to add new features and useful enhancements, important bug fixes and crucial improvements to software stability, along with performance and speed boosts by taking advantage of Intel's and AMD's new CPUs and also GPU acceleration provided by specific Nvidia graphics processors.  One really cool performance feature offered by VideoStudio is that it has a \"Smart Proxy\" editing mode, where you can edit high-definition video in a low-resolution mode, thereby allowing you to use a slower computer without necessarily slowing down to a sluggish crawl.  These performance enhancements offer a huge advantage because many of us do not upgrade our computers frequently with the latest fastest CPU processors.  So some of the other brands of video editing software may be unbearably slow on these slower computers (even to the point of completely freezing up) while VideoStudio X4 can still zip along with a decent amount of responsiveness on slower computers.\n\nEven though I do not like how Corel has organized the user interface layout for their PaintShop Pro X4 photo-editing software, I continue to like the changes and improvements that they have made to this VideoStudio X4.  I can resize, drag, dock, and undock various windows and UI elements to suit my workspace preferences and everything seems to behave intuitively.  But as with how Corel has designed their help system for PaintShop Pro X4 software, the one aspect of the VideoStudio X4 user interface that I really dislike is that to access the help menus, I am forced to hop through intermediate menus before it launches the online help from Corel's Web site using my browser.  With both PaintShop Pro X4 and VideoStudio X4, I now just bookmark the help information URLs and access them directly from my browser instead of clicking the cumbersome help button from within the application.  Even though the latest and most up-to-date online help information can be dynamically accessed directly from Corel's Web site when using this browser approach, I would still really prefer the previous approach of at least being given the option during the installation of the software to load the full help documentation on my computer's local hard drive since that also gives me the freedom to access the user manuals and help guides when I use the software without having Internet access.\n\nI had fun using the new time-lapse photography feature.  I used a Canon Timer Remote Controller TC-80N3 to shoot a series of timer-delayed photos of the sun setting behind the mountains and another cool every-two-minutes photo series that I made last summer of a morning glory vine slowly opening up its blooms, and then I used the VideoStudio X4's time-lapse photography feature to create a video from both of these photo series that look like a sped-up time-lapse movie.  If both videos had been recorded as real-time videos, they would have been mind-numbingly boring to watch, but when sped up using the time-lapse feature, they allow everyday people like me to showcase the wonders of nature just like how the professional movies and television nature programs use time-lapse photography.\n\nThe software lets me use both standard definition and HD videos, and editing, authoring, and burning of both video types is easy.  The software is very flexible in importing videos from your hard drive or capturing them directly from your video recorders.  There are flexible options for viewing your files in different ways such as timeline or storyboard modes, which are useful for adding videos, pictures, text, audio and music tracks.  You can also trim or split your video into sections for better continuity, adding transitions and enhancing with many kinds of built-in effects.  Once you upload your video, you can trim and divide the video into clips.  Trimming is marking the beginning and ending of an entire clip, while multi-trimming is useful to divide one segment into multiple clips.  Multi-trimming is very useful for editing out various parts of a recorded video to exclude sections that are boring or extraneous.  This software's trimming functions are powerful and very easy to use, allowing me to feel like a Hollywood film director while I edit my videos to make them flow seamlessly between different scenes.\n\nAs with previous versions of VideoStudio, you can import photos to create a photo slideshow along with adding text and music accompaniment.  The software is very flexible for adding music or audio voiceovers to your video projects from a variety of sources.  You can add audio to your projects in Corel VideoStudio X4 using various methods such as adding audio files to the library from your hard drive, ripping music from a CD, or recording a voiceover clip.  You can edit the audio clips using a built-in sound mixer to adjust the volume, length and duration, fade-in/fade-out, and apply various mixing and sound filter effects to the audio tracks.  The video editor does limit you to six overlay video tracks along with your main video track, combined with up to two title tracks, a voice track, and three music tracks.  While this is less than some video-editing software that lets you incorporate many dozens of tracks, it is more than sufficient for the vast majority of everyday users (like me) who mainly work with personal videos and it is sufficient even for editing important events like videos of weddings and vacations.\n\nAfter you have finished editing your video masterpiece, you can export in a variety of common formats including FLV files for YouTube, MPG (MPEG-1/MPEG-2), AVCHD, WMV HD, Windows Media, RealMedia, AVI, and QuickTime.  You also have the option to upload your work to Vimeo, Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube.  The software can create menus for DVD, Blu-ray, AVCHD, and it offers eight Blu-ray and twelve DVD menu choices.  This X4 version also adds new 3D video capabilities.  Even though I admit that I am a 3D video editing newbie, this feature seems limited and fairly rudimentary in its 3D rendering options, but it can create some pretty cool eye-popping 3D effects and is easy to use.  This will NOT get you the kind of 3D video that Hollywood can create, but it does add another dimension of \"eye candy Wow factor\" to your videos...  Just don't expect to create your own version of an \"Avatar 3D\" movie.  3D glasses are included with the software.\n\nThis is a big complex software application that really requires some patience for you to slowly become more familiar with all of its features and power.  But its user interface is cleanly designed so that newbie first-timers can start editing their videos with ease without fully mastering all of its powerful features.  Fortunately, Corel also provides plenty of online help along with easy-to-use templates and more than 60 really cool special effects and more than 150 transition effects to let you experiment and try out many of its flexible options so even video-editing newbies can create a polished slick video with ease.  The software uses a nondestructive editing approach so that your original video file is not being directly modified along the way.  This also allows you to experiment, even trying out wacky ideas and special effects, turning a tedious chore into a fun playtime of creating video eye candy.\n\nBack when I was using VideoStudio X2, the software had various erratic and quirky bugs and serious stability issues; it can be disheartening to have the software freeze up after you have spent more than an hour editing a video.  Many of these problems have thankfully been resolved in this version X4; not once did I encounter a freeze-up or crash during my edits using X4.  When used on an older slower Windows Vista laptop of mine, the software can be sluggishly slow sometimes, but I prefer dealing with slower performance on a slower computer than having to deal with annoying software bugs and applications that freeze up or crash on me, so I accept the fact that I have to wait longer when using VideoStudio X4 on a slower laptop that is more than four years old.  As with any video editing software, especially when editing HD videos, your best experience will result from using a fast computer with lots of memory.  While this VideoStudio X4 lacks some of the features and has more track-editing limitations when compared to both CyberLink PowerDirector and Adobe Premiere, I think that it beats those two when it comes to multi-trim clip editing, key framing, and its best-in-class stop-motion and time-lapse animation capabilities.  And VideoStudio X4 is far easier and more intuitive to learn for a newbie compared to Adobe Premiere's dense complexity.  If this software was priced at $300, I would rate it 4 stars or maybe 3.5 stars, but with its inexpensive list price and Corel's frequent heavy pricing discounts, I rate it 5 stars because you really do get a lot of video editing bang for the buck here.  And if you are not technically adept, have some patience as you familiarize yourself with the software.\n\nAlso, Corel has released two important service pack patch updates for VideoStudio Pro X4.  After installing VideoStudio Pro on your computer, you can either download these large executable files from Corel's Web site, or from the user interface, click 'Help' and \"Check for Updates\" to download and install the service packs that way.", "summary": "Powerful video editing with great stop-motion and time-lapse animation capabilities; need patience to learn all of its features.", "unixReviewTime": 1336003200}

Have owned many different models, including an LCIII, G3 Desktop, an eMac, the very first iMac, an iMac G5, a PowerBook G4, this Mac Pro Tower, and I have used Windows computers in offices I have worked in.  I have also helped friends with their Macs and other friends with their Windows computers.  I have also tried later versions of Macintosh Operating Systems including Mountain Lion and Mavericks.\n\nSo given my history, I should know something of what I am talking about, and I can guarantee that Snow Leopard is the BEST.\n\nI really liked Tiger a lot, but it doesn't run on Intels.  Leopard was apparently a bloated mess that ran very slow. Versions after Snow Leopard are missing very useful features... But Snow Leopard is a Lean, Clean, Stream Lined, Fast, Powerful, Reliable Beauty with all the features I have ever wanted or needed.\n\nThe first two things I noticed MISSING with versions of the Macintosh Operating System after Snow Leopard:\n\n1.  You can no longer simply double click on a folder to see the contents in a new window.  You have to Option Double Click or something.  This is ridiculous.  The ability to EASILY: Create folders, name and rename folders, and organize my stuff into folders by dragging files and folders into other folders... is the NUMBER ONE REASON THAT I HAVE LOVED USING MACS SINCE 1993.\n\n2.

Every time I open Safari in Snow Leopard, my Bookmarks page is right there waiting for me to choose something I refer to all the time.  Most of my Bookmarks are organized into folders all named appropriately, and though I am behind in putting Bookmarks from the New Bookmarks list into the appropriate folders, I can still find what I am looking for very quickly.  But with NO Bookmarks Page in subsequent versions of the Mac OS, it would be IMPOSSIBLE for me to use BOOKMARKS ANY MORE.\n\n3.  I have just read that in the latest version of the Mac OS, there are even MORE things missing that people used all the time, like:\na.  No Geotracking in iPhoto, because iPhoto is GONE, and some CHEAP replacement called simply Photo has taken its place.\nb.

So I was automatically comparing this software to what I know can be done for each type of project - which I realize is not totally fair.  So I tried to get my mindset into that of a person who is using this type of media program for the first time.\n\nI loaded this on a Windows Vista computer and the setup process was quick and trouble-free.  There were no nags to register the software; there were no codes to enter to get the software to work.  I have Vista set to display at 120dpi (larger fonts) and I notices that there was some clipping of the columns and some missing horizontal scroll bars with that setting, so just a head's up about that if you use the large font setting in Windows.\n\nAs others have mentioned, operation of the software in intuitive - icons are the preferred method, with only a few drop-down menus.  Personally, I prefer menus on the project screens.  The software operated quickly in the functions I tried out.  I was able to make a slide show without problem.  When I tried to make a film, I noticed a glitch in the transition between one image and another at the same point, no matter which transition I used.  I don't know the cause of that problem.  A \"media converter\" is advertised, but as far as I can tell, it is only a video converter, not an audio one, because the convert function icon did not appear when I opened up my Music folder (I've got Amazon MP3's in it).  There's a nice program for creating calendar and cards; the scrapbook one had just basic themes - nothing of interest if you are a serious scrap-booker but I suppose it's an okay intro for people who've never done that before.  There's a nice assortment of color, artistic and text editing tools to introduce the novice to photo editing.  It is very easy to create the previously mentioned slide shows and movies (a number of movie formats are supported) so I think someone who had never created one before would get a kick out of that; you can also create screen-savers from your images.\n\nYou can really do a lot of things with this software, so I would recommend it for a person who wants to start playing with their image files and learning what can be done with digital images.  Amazon currently has (at the time of this review) it discounted by 40%, so that's a very good price for all of the tools you're getting. It's good entry-level software which allows the user to accomplish a lot of tasks that they might never have thought of doing before, and it does make uploading videos to Facebook, Flickr, Vimeo, etc. very easy. The caveat is that if your level of expertise is beyond that, this program isn't going to have all the dedicated bells-and-whistles that you might need and/or want.  But it is a good, basic program and one that I could see giving to my less technically-inclined friends.  For myself and my needs, I would give it three stars, but for novices to its functions I think that it would be a four-star program so that's why I gave it the rating I did.", "summary": "Relatively Basic All-Purpose Tool", "unixReviewTime": 1297814400}

You also get free upgrades automatically and scans automatically on a schedule that you can decide.  You can also do a scan whenever you want by simply opening the AVG control center.  There's a thing called LinkScanner SurfShield which ensures every website you visit is safe and you get a message if there's a question so you can avoid the site or override the software and take your chances.\n\nAll in all, it's a great security program.

The unique office-friendly design with integrated mounting and cable management are stand-out differentiators. This \"smart-switch\" has management capability appropriate for a office environment switch with power-saving electronics.\n\nDesign:\nOne of the first things that stands out on the ProSAFE Click switches is the form factor. The sleek dimensions clearly have the modular office environment in mind and can mount at many places in modular non-modular office environments.\n\nThe click mounting system makes mounting a snap - literally. The locking tab make secure mounting of the Click Switch to the base in any of 2 orientations.\n\nThe 8 port version has a sturdy plastic case in a silent fanless design. The 16 port model is also fanless, but has a durable metal case.\n\nThe 8 port model provides 2 convenient USB charging ports suitable for tablets and other high-charge USB applications.  The power budget is 15W for both and any one port limited to 10W. This makes it handy in offices and conference rooms making it convenient for tablets or phones to get a charge boost. I like this in my home office because it eliminates 2 power bricks from my power strip.\n\nThe interesting power connection can be plugged in to have the cable exit either in the same direction and the network cables or at 90 degrees to that out the long dimension. There is no \"power brick\" to clog up power strips - the power adapter is internal to the switch. Something I find a very desirable feature.\n\nThe included Velcro cables tie completes the picture of switch design by someone who was thinking about usability in the real world as much as moving bits and bytes.\n\nConfiguration:\nI downloaded and installed the ProSafe Plus Configuration Utility from the Netgear support site. The configuration utility found the switch automagically making it super easy perform initial setup on the Click Switch. The intuitive process was easy and there are only a couple of things to setup unless you need advanced features.\n\n' Set the IP address - I recommend setting either a static IP address or a DHCP reserved address (what I did in my firewall) so the switch will always be at the same IP address.\n' Change the password - The default password is \"password\", so change it to something better!\n\nThe Click Switch also has a web based management interface that is very usable if you prefer that instead of the configuration utility. I do.\n\nThe advanced (and just nice) configurable features include:\n' The port LEDs can be turned off so they are not distracting (Just nice and good for bedrooms too!)\n' IEEE 802.1Q-or port-based VLANs are supported for segregated traffic (i.e. voip/data)\n' Extensive QoS by WRR, strict priority, or both, Port-based QoS, IEEE 801.2p QoS, ToS QoS and DSCP based QoS. These are to help make sure time sensitive traffic gets priority (i.e. voip or video).\n' Port by port Rate limiting\n' Port by port link speed and flow control settings (including a \"disable\" setting to turn a port off if desired)\n' Port by port Broadcast Filtering\n' Port by port cable testing (good for a quick cable integrity check)\n' Multicast control via IGMP snooping\n' Port mirroring which connects two ports like a old school hub (good for troubleshooting or some monitoring)\n\nNote: the 8 port model has no LAG (Link Aggregation Groups aka Trunking). The 16 port model has up to 2 LAG group which can be nice for devices with 2 LAN ports that support static LAG. NAS devices come to mind.\n\nMost users will not need to mess with most of the advanced features.\n\nGreen Power Use:\nThe 8 port Click Switch uses a max of 20.1W of power including 15W of USB charging occurring at the same time. This means without someone charging their device power maxes out about 5W. With smart port power management most of the time power consumption should be less. Perhaps much less. This is less power than used to be common for unmanaged or \"dumb\" switches. The savings can add up if you have a bunch of these in your business.\n\nSupport:\nI did not need to contact support with the 8 port Click switch, but while testing my 16 port model I did and got excellent support. Be sure to register your Click switch within 30 days of purchase and you'll get  a lifetime warranty for a little extra peace of mind.\n\nConclusions:\nThe Netgear ProSAFE 8-Port Gigabit Click Switch has game-changing office oriented design and usability in a silent package. It is a capable smart switch which has good management and important features. The advanced features can make it possible to reliably integrate time sensitive traffic in the same switch as NAS file sharing, isolate traffic via VLAN support and more.\n\nThe switch is wire-speed which means it can move traffic as fast as it can be pushed over the individual LAN cables. In my testing this is the case as with pretty much any modern smart and many \"dumb\" switches. Getting data through a switch has become pretty much a given these days.\n\nI had moved away from Netgear switches in recent years. Other manufacturers had more attractive solutions for my clients' needs. Not so with the Click Switch.

Interestingly, Bento was the name given to a layer in Apple's visionary OpenDoc architecture launched with System 7.5 in the mid 1990s.\n\nBento is a personal (as opposed to \"enterprise\" or networked) database that's meant to be as easy to use as the Mac itself. It has a carefully-identified set of features. These run parallel to those of iWork's Pages and Numbers. It could have been called i(Data)Base to aim at a comparable niche in the market. Bento complements Pages and Numbers nicely. The criticisms that some users (and reviewers) leveled at Bento, that it lacked, for example, scripting, Automator and network support, miss the point. It was never intended for those sorts of uses - or those types of users; look at FileMaker Pro for such extended power.\n\nBento was specifically designed and released without such features in order to concentrate on the less-experienced consumer and SOHO user. Some missing areas of functionality might be useful to the non-specialist user. On the whole, though, the balance between price and feature set, not to mention features, means that Bento can be safely recommended.\n\nBento is designed to accomplish everyday tasks using a pleasing and straightforward template-based interface The very fact that it is simple, has only one window, and just the right number and design of a few uncluttered menus adds to its accessibility and effectiveness as a flexible and powerful tool.\n\nIt only takes a quick glance at the lively, comprehensive and very well supported and moderated Bento forum to see how easy it is to achieve sophisticated date calculations and many-to-many implementation; Bento's apparent simplicity can be deceptive. Bento Users is another useful site. The documentation that comes with the product is excellent.\n\nEveryday\nFileMaker has compiled a list of some of the more likely projects that Bento can handle. These include:\n\n* what FileMaker, Inc. calls \"virtually unlimited\" contact details\n* coordinating events, parties, and fundraisers\n* tracking projects, assignments, and deadlines\n* prioritizing tasks; Bento has been used successfully in a Getting Things Done task management context\n* inventories, donations, and items for sale\n* track hours worked, payments due, invoicing\n* rate service providers and sellers\n* libraries for music, movies, and media\n* store files and photos related to projects and events\n\nand, rather cryptically, since this ought to be part of any good data model:\n\n* connect related information together to see more details.\n\nThere are ample standalone products to achieve many of these tasks - Project Managers like OmniPlan and task management - the same company's OmniFocus. Bruji's outstanding BookPedia and CDPedia. There are dedicated time management and billing/invoice suites like TimeNet Pro - though none without some flaw; and iPhoto, Address Book and iCal themselves, with the last two of which Bento integrates closely.\n\nIt is what it is\nSo the criteria for MyMac's evaluation must not be, What's missing from Bento? Rather, how well does this reasonably-priced and robust Leopard-only product do what it's been designed to do?\n\nFirst and foremost, then, is a courageous - and largely successful - attempt to make database design and management accessible to those who are not specialists or experts in such software, but who still have demanding needs such as some of those just mentioned.\n\nBento's main window consists of three panes:\n\nThe leftmost pane is the Source List of all your data Libraries. Libraries are Bento's top organizational level - like iPhoto 7's \"Events.\" One Bento Library is for one set of data or project. Under these in the Source List are Bento's Collections; these are like iTunes' Playlists - subsets of the data in the Libraries. Then Smart Collections behave just as you would expect: they're Views updated in real time and as your filter criteria - or the records that matches them - change. You might, for example, want to create a Smart Collection of all unpaid invoices - as they get paid, they disappear; or of all unsold artifacts in a craft store - as they are sold, they disappear.\n\nThe records area is in the middle and is the largest pane. Data can be presented as a form (an individual record) or table of as many records as will fit into the space. You can have more than one form for any Library (each may display different fields - in different orders). This is emphasis on the user experience again; it drives the way you work. Each view is satisfactorily editable - columns can be dragged horizontally for display; you can chose which you will view too. The principles, of course, are analogous to those in FileMaker's \"Align\" routines and fit well with the sophisticated controls that Bento offers.\n\nThe Associated fields list for each Library is on the right. Fields are created here and dragged and dropped onto the Records area. There are only three attributes for each. There is also control over how many of these three panes will appear - you can focus on what you're doing.\n\nThis is a familiar interface; and it preserves the metaphors for data handling on which Bento rests. Similarly, searching, sorting, and summaries are all swift and intuitive. Searching can be very sophisticated and saved as a Smart Collection.\n\nNote, though, that this means that there's no concept of separate datastores in Bento. All the data which you use Bento to maintain is managed in one place. You can still share Libraries with other users. Yet if you organize your data according to \"domains\" within your life (household, work, hobbies, friends, you may find it a disadvantage to access it all in and from one place by launching the Bento application itself as opposed to separately-located data files. On the other hand, this is very much in keeping with current Mac practice: it is the way that iCal, iPhoto, iTunes, iWeb (though not Pages or Numbers) all work. More evidence of the perceived target audience; for them it is assumed the task in hand is more important than file names, file management.\n\nData Types\nGiven these intentional restrictions, the substantial variety of data types (nineteen of them) which Bento handles is impressive: basic text, numbers, dates, drop-downs, Booleans, graphics, sounds, movies, ratings, addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses and more. There's also a FileMaker-like calculation field which can, for example, concatenate text and multiple fields values as well as perform simple mathematical operations. Inevitably there will be some function missing for someone, but on the whole it's comprehensive - and very easy to use.\n\nTemplates\nFor all its transparency, Bento is not a glorified Wizard. Fields can be controlled - use drag and drop. Fields are rearranged and resized with the mouse - usual Mac style. Some positioning and alignment of text is possible using a toolbar - though probably less than most people will come to want: five text sizes, no choice of fonts. One of the biggest hurdles that the marketing of Bento has to overcome is to make it plain that these are flexible means to an end - although the (new) user's first contact with the program will be the 20 templates that come with the software. These templates are shells; they are not one and the same as the data which they are used to present. If the designers of Bento have understood just what it is that a majority of users want in terms of the payoff between interface and ease of use as opposed to in depth functionality, then they have surely got a winner on their hands. The number of downloads (a quarter of a million) in the first few months since Bento became available suggests that is the case.\n\nAddress Book and iCal integration\nBy default Bento has Libraries for contacts, events, and tasks. These are the same as those in Leopard's Address Book and iCal; they are not synched. Although these Libraries can be removed - \"Disconnected\" - from Bento in its \"Home\" menu, to do so is to lose access to those applications' data. What's more, to edit in Bento - or worse delete - data that's derived from Address Book and iCal is to lose it directly from those same applications actually outside the Bento environment. Integration is tight: you could drag and drop a set of contacts from the Address Book Library right into Bento's Source list to create a Collection. This \"disconnection\" could usefully be supplemented by a preference letting you work from a duplicate and/or advising you that you could conceivably lose permanently (unless backed up) data of which you might have thought you were only working on a copy.\n\nImport-Export\nBento supports only CSV (Comma Separated Value) for import and export of data, although there are ways aplenty to convert that after or before the fact. So that's a limitation only inasmuch as you may need another utility and two steps. The importer is drag-and-drop then Wizard-based and worked very well in testing. The Wizard asks which values from the file to be imported should correspond with which fields in Bento.\n\nRelations\nThe way that Bento handles relations - the fields in other tables whose data you need to appear in the current one - is one of the program's main limitations: it's not a conventional relational database. But, again, it's an approach designed to give the greatest likely desired power with the simplest steps.\n\nIn your \"local\" Library you create a field of type \"Related Records List\"; then you indicate from which Library you want to use data. Dropping that field on your form displays a small empty table corresponding to the \"remote\" Library. You click the \"Add related records from a list\" icon at the bottom of the inset table to see actual data. Bento displays the corresponding list of records from the associated library. Changing records in the one changes them in the other. Deleting a record in the \"local\" Library only deletes it only from the Related Records List (the \"local\" dataset) and not from the associated Library. This more closely follows the practice of removing a record from a Smart Folder, Collection or Playlist. It's a way of preventing mistakes - although not entirely logical, until you're used to it. It's also another example of ease of use; accessibility takes precedence. Note, too though, that Smart Collections cannot include data from related tables. That may be a significant restriction for some.\n\nWhat is likely to be a real drawback, though, is the fact that by \"Related Records\" Bento means essentially a \"Portal\" to all the records in the \"remote\" Library. There is no concept of a \"Join\" using Primary and Foreign Keys. This means that you cannot be selective in the way you relate and view such records.\n\nConclusions\nBento is a package. A compromise. MyMac's advice is that - after reading this review - you match what it can do against your needs. Almost certainly you may have requirements which Bento seems unable to meet. But look closely. Sure, its interface is user-friendly - and more important, perhaps, Bento itself is easy to use. But this doesn't mean it's in any way crippled and \"less than\" comparable databases of this level of complexity - relational features aside.\n\nIt's much closer to Pages, Numbers, iPhoto, iTunes in feel and scope than it is to FileMaker. But prolonged use for this review has revealed that Bento can easily be made to do more than might be apparent even from glancing familiarity with the delightful sophistication of the interface.\n\nGiven some of the things that Bento can do, there's a remarkably high ratio between effort and result. Whether or not it's for you will depend firstly on whether you have Leopard. Then on your data handling requirements: total size of data set, complexity of relations and perhaps the way (or whether) you use iCal and Address Book. Then you should decide whether one of the absent features (scripting, full control over template fonts, a missing calculation, say) rules it out.\n\nFor many users the extremely pleasing appearance of Bento will be a winner. How nice to be able to work in a fully Mac-like environment using an inventory of - car parts.\n\nA balance has been struck: users with complex, evolving and intricately relational databases may still be best with FileMaker Pro. Those for whom the lure of an elegant user interface is important and/or who want a direct equivalent of Numbers, Pages and iPhoto/iTunes and/or seamless integration with iCal and Address Book should look seriously at Bento. Download the trial, use it carefully and draw on the many sources of online help, remember its very reasonable price, decide whether you'll be able to make Bento do a variety of things for you larger than the dedicated software mentioned at the beginning of this review can do - and see!\n\nPros: the interface - it's good-looking, simple and easy to use; many data types supported; integration with Address Book and iCal; templates work with many types of file; works with iPhone and .Mac\n\nCons: the interface - the changes you can make to its appearance are somewhat limited; poor relational capabilities; mass updates to records not supported\n\nMyMac.com Rating: 4 out of 5\nOriginally published at : [...]", "summary": "Mark Sealey MyMac.com Review", "unixReviewTime": 1210204800}

I googled my multitude of problems and found that several people were have the same sorts of problems and identified Norton as the root cause. At first I rejected out of hand that a company as legendary and well regarded as Norton could be at the root of my problems, but decided out of frustration to delete the program and see how it impacted the multiple problems I was having.\n\nLow and behold my problems miraculously vanished!

More on that later.  For the most part, I've never had a problem with Norton products. I always opt to buy the retail version because it is far cheaper than their renewal pricing, even their \"sale\" or \"special\" pricing.  I have yet to catch any malware while under Norton's watch although much of that is also in part due to common sense and experience gained from working in the IT field.\n\nLast year, Norton decided to change to a new subscription model.  Some aspects of it are great, such as the ability to finally protect a realistic number of devices affordably under one license. The three device limit was too limited even a decade ago, let alone now.  With Norton premium, I can protect 10 devices for a realistic price. Considering the size of my family and the number of computing and mobile devices we use, even that isn't sufficient to cover every device but at least all of the most vulnerable devices like our PC's are covered.\n\nIt appears Norton has gone completely cloud based.  I ordered the so-called retail package instead of the cloud version from Amazon. I was sent a box with a card inside that had an activation URL and a key code on it.  That's it.  Honestly, they should stop offering the retail version altogether if that's the case. At least ship the cards in envelopes or something else smaller than traditional sized software boxes large enough to hold a jewel-cased optical disk and instruction manual.\n\nNorton Security Premium works on PC's, Macs, smartphones and tablets.  I can speak from both personal experience and feedback from other users that although it technically \"works\" on Apple devices, it's pretty much worthless in OSX and iOS. It is great on Android and Windows devices, offering true protection and no noticeable performance hit. It can actually do more harm than good to Macs and offers nothing useful at all on iOS devices.  Apple owners, save your loot, seriously.\n\nInstallation is usually straightforward.  In the past, I'd simply uninstall the previous version and install the new version.  It seems that recent past versions did a much better job of removing all of the files it installed. The new Norton Security seems to be falling back into some of the bad habits of much earlier versions of Norton, leaving files behind that can interfere with subsequent installs.  I had a few hiccups with my new installation and activation that I hadn't encountered in at least the past 3-4 years. Once installed, it offers antivirus and malware protection as well as online protection, automated backup and 25 GB of cloud storage.  Basically, I only use the AV/malware portion.  It also offers child monitoring features through Norton Family but they can be had for free with a Norton account.  In fact, the Premier version of Norton Family will set you back fifty-bucks regardless of which version of Norton Security you own.\n\nNorton goes way out of the way to make retail upgrades... well, actually, there is no such thing because a new retail license is just that, a new retail license.  True upgrades have to be purchased directly from Symantec.  Despite being offered the option to enter a new product key in my recently expired subscription, it didn't work in either the online management or the desktop client. I had to create a new subscription in my account, uninstall the expired client and download and re-install the client from the new subscription tab. Speaking of tabs, Norton management provides no way to delete expired subscription tabs.  I have fifteen tabs for products dating back years and fourteen of them are expired.  Each has a button offering to renew but none has an option to delete.  It's cluttered and ridiculous looking.  I'm almost ready to create a new Norton account because I'm so tired of the messy interface.  Despite some good points like dynamic online management of specific device licenses, the entire management scheme seems very clumsy.\n\nSo that's my take.  Norton Security does a good job of protecting my PC with minimal impact on the resources.  It is pretty much worthless on my Mac and iOS devices but they don't really need quite as badly as my other devices anyhow. Plus, I have better options, at least on my Mac.  Activation and renewal seem to have gotten clumsier with the new version along with uninstalling.  Those minor headaches are no reason to jump ship.  Best of all, it protects 10 PCs for pretty much the same price I paid to protect a paltry number of three PC's as recently as a year ago.", "summary": "Solid protection but terribly flawed subscription management scheme", "unixReviewTime": 1449187200}

I think the problem is I am looking for features that the application just doesn't have?  It's also not very stable and I can tell you that it's not my system.  I built my system myself and it's fully loaded with a Phenom II triple-core processor, 4GB of RAM, Windows 7 and all the bell and whistles lovingly maintained by myself.  Yet, this hangs/crashes most of the time I try to use it.\n\nFirst, starting with the photo suite.  I had a really hard time figuring out how to get my photos imported into this program.  Why can't it just use the Windows 7 libraries I'd already set up?  Same for videos?  I didn't find there was a whole lot I could do with the photos once I got them up and running (after several crashes -- maybe it doesn't like they are all on my home server on the network?).  Microsoft Live Essentials is free and it works much better and I can do a lot more with it.\n\nSecond, starting with the video suite.  I never really got this working.  It just kept crashing trying to load in movies.  I can load in the same movies into Roxio and Windows Movie Maker.  I had to give up.  I really wanted to test the editing features here.\n\nThird, DVD/CD burning.  I wanted to burn an ISO to a DVD so I could install Ubuntu on a new system.  I never found the option for doing so.  Is there one?  I had to use Roxio instead.  I never got around to trying to take some home movies and make a DVD out of it.  Again, crashing/hanging.\n\nFinally, WinDVD.  I'd heard all kind of good things about WinDVD, especially the Bluray support.  Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work with Bluray?  Maybe it does and I haven't figured it out?  Nothing seems to be intuitive here or it's so simple the features just don't exist?  Windows Media Center comes with Windows 7 and it can play DVDs.\n\nSo, now it's been installed for quite a while on my PC and I never use it.

Useful for sketching, for composing, for testing out ideas, for putting together test pieces. Allows you to discover new processes and try new mediums.

Since the 2003 and 2004 version of this software program I have experienced SEVERE slowing down of my computer, hanging up of my computer when trying to shut it down, and prolonged start up times ALL of which were cured when I took this bloated software off my computer.\n\nI'm not a software designer or a computer expert but am reasonably adept and skilled on the computer and can for the most part fix nearly every problem I encounter. I don't understand exactly WHY removing Norton solved my problems but I can tell you this: My computer has NEVER run so well and with so few problems. No crashes, no hanging up on shut down or start up, and lightening quick responsiveness once again.\n\nThe problems caused by this Norton program flummoxed until I finally isolated Norton as the culprit. I googled my multitude of problems and found that several people were have the same sorts of problems and identified Norton as the root cause. At first I rejected out of hand that a company as legendary and well regarded as Norton could be at the root of my problems, but decided out of frustration to delete the program and see how it impacted the multiple problems I was having.\n\nLow and behold my problems miraculously vanished! I couldn't believe it! My daughter who had problems on start up worse than mine balked too at removing this program from her laptop but also discovered that the removal of Norton solved HER problems as well.\n\nThis new product has dropped the antispam and ad blocking functionality available in previous versions. You do have the opportunity, however, to buy these separately should you be so foolish.  The new interface, to my way of thinking, is not as good as prior versions.  Installation itself can be an adventure in frustration as it was for me.  Worse, taking the damn thing off presents unique problems as well.\n\nI told one of my friends what I'd discovered and he too deleted the program only to see all of his multiple problems disappear! He told me that he simply couldn't believe how good his computer was once again functioning. My uncle called me yesterday. He resisted taking Norton off his computer because he thought I was exaggerating the problems caused by Norton. He finally took Norton off when another of his friends told him the same thing. He told me he should have acted sooner thereby saving him all sorts of problems and heartaches.\n\nI've replaced Norton System Works with Trend Micro's PC-Cillin and Zone Alarm both of which are highly regarded.

It is hard to imagine what is going through their heads. These fools figure they can sell junk software forever. WRONG!! They are destroying their franchise. I will not put ANY Symantec software on my computer.  They are quirky, resource hogging, intrusive garbage which are nearly impossible to completely uninstall from your computer.

One thing that bothers me is that the user guide is an included PDF, so I will have it as long as I have the Corel Painter CD, but the tutorials are made available as YouTube videos.

Maybe the larger and much more expensive PhotoShop programs do a little more, maybe they are a little easier to use, or maybe the Nay Sayers just hate Canadians.  How would I know?  I don't even own anything from PhotoShop except Elements 7.\n\nI started editing photos using Picasa, the free download from Google.  That was okay then - for my level of expertise.  Later, I improved my results a little by using PhotoShop Elements 7.  It was a lot more difficult to use than Picasa, but the results were worth the extra effort.  Both accepted Canon RAW formats.\n\nNow I'm using Coral Paint Shop Pro Ultimate Photo X2 - and the other smaller programs included for free.  I am amazed that good User Guides, and excellent Video Instructions, are included at no additional charge.  I did purchase a book for Coral's Photo X3, but just to see if it's worth the upgrade to me.  It is.  I'm saving up (or waiting for the price to drop when X4 comes out).\n\nOf course all these new potentials are kind of overwhelming at first.  But I can use just the easy parts or, if inspired by a one of my pictures, I can go to whatever level I'm willing to expend the effort to use.\n\nWhat's all this griping about complexity and crashing.  Access to many solutions (that must be complex) is desired.  As far as crashes, does anyone really know why any given program crashes?  They all crash.  Get used to it.  Take precautions. SAVE YOUR WORK FREQUENTLY.  As for the sometimes complaint of running slow, my top of the line Canon Pro9000 Mark II prints slow, especially with high resolution Canon RAW photographs.

Dubose", "reviewText": "The necessary evil when it comes to computers these days.  With some many products on the market, which  one do we choose.  If you anything like me, you have multi pcs in your house and they all need protection.  So AVG Internet Security, when it comes to this I think of couple of things.  Will it really protect my systems, how much will it slow down my PC. I've always looked for a balance of both.  These products will either bring your PC to a halt while its protecting you or will not slow your machine at all and provide minimum protection.  So Let give AVG a try.  Since we all know about these products I will get to the point and let you know exactly what you need to make your own decision and A/V products.\n\nInstallation is a breeze, though it requires a system restart. During installation though you have the option to install their toolbar, which has some security benefits.  From looking around at some independent antivirus labs, they gave it a pretty good score. It had good malware detection, the linkScanner blocks exploits (love this feature for my babies), malicious sites. Antiphishing component less accurate than IE alone so I wouldn't use this feature.  I would let IE handle this.  Free identity theft recovery service,  includes tune-up utility which will only run once, you will have to pay extra for this feature (which stinks!  you can perform a single tune-up for free or unlimited tune-ups by purchasing the $29.99 product.  I had assumed that those who purchased the full suite would also get full access to the tune-up tool. I assumed wrong. Even if you've bought the suite full access to the tune-up tool requires a separate purchase. Do go ahead and run it to take advantage of that one-time performance tune-up, but make sure to do so when you can spare some time to try the other features during the 24-hour trial period. Accurate spam filtering.  Small effect on system performance (which is HUGE for me).\n\nAVG's security suite offers three things the free antivirus doesn't: a so-so firewall, an accurate spam filter.  The paid version is a bite more stable than than the free version.  There's so much protection in the free product that it's hard to justify paying for the suite.  AVG Internet Security 2011 is a good security suite, but on a practical level, I feel it really needs to be revamped and simplified. The antispam and firewall settings in particular include way too many settings that users simply should not touch. And the main window that tracks fourteen distinct security components could be streamlined to better inform the user.\n\nA huge portion of the suite's components are available in the free antivirus, and the value-add components don't impress. The firewall is so-so,  the antispam is very good, but many users don't need antispam. Surprisingly, the tune-up feature requires yet another payout for full functionality. And for the market sub-group who want parental control in a suite, AVG is a no-go.", "summary": "For the Price I expected better.", "unixReviewTime": 1316649600}

All the reviews say it's terrifying, and I'm really not into that. But, since I got it as a Christmas present, I gave it a try. And I will be the first to tell you that it's NOT terrifying, and it's actually pretty good! I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.\n\nPLOT - 5/5: Nancy goes to visit her friend Sally MacDonald at Moon Lake because Sally says some terrible things have been happening at her lakeside cabin. When Nancy gets there, though, Sally has left out of fear. So Nancy decides to stay and solve the mystery of the ghost dogs who show up at night and attack the cabin. I thought this was a really good plot. Unlike in some other ND titles, I really wanted to solve the mystery and find out where these dogs were coming from. And trust me, the dogs weren't the least bit scary. The plot wasn't too short or too long. Another solid plot from Her Interactive!\n\nCHARACTERS - 4/5: There was a real lack of characters in this game. There were only 3 that you could actually see. I guess they did that so Moon Lake would really feel desolate, and it worked. The three main characters were Red Knott, an anti-social bird watcher, Emily Griffen, the store owner who has a fun accent, and Jeff Akers, the lone park ranger. Overall, the characters were OK. I kind of wish there was more, though.\n\nSETTING - 4/5: The setting was pretty good. I can't say it was beautiful or anything, because although it was well done, it was just kind of creepy looking. But there was lots to explore, including a whole forest maze that was really hard to get the hang of. There wasn't much to see inside the cabin, or around the lake, but the forest was pretty big so that made up for it.\n\nPUZZLES - 4/5: The puzzles were pretty easy in this game. I could figure most of them out without a walkthrough. The maze was probably one of the hardest puzzles, and I kept getting lost. But other than that they were all short and sweet.\n\nWAS IT CHALLENGEING?: Nope. I never got frusterated, I only died like once, and I barely used a walkthrough. 2/5\n\nENDING - 5/5: The ending was actually good! I liked how they revealed who the culprit was, and catching them was very clever. Plus everything leading up to the ending was fun too.\n\nFINAL SCORE:\nPlot: 5\nCharacters: 4\nSetting: 4\nPuzzles: 4\nChallenge: 2\nEnding: 5\n= 24, divided by 6 = 4 stars", "summary": "Ghostly Fun!", "unixReviewTime": 1294012800}

This ribbon is a customizable bar with buttons.

OK, Pros & Cons:\n\nPRO\n-It plays my 4K video clips ABSOLUTELY SMOOTH, I can't believe it, first player to do so. QuickTime Pro runs like a train going uphill with square wheels when I throw 4K video at it. PowerDVD Ultra is smooth as glass, I didn't expect that (I'll list my PC specs at the bottom, that does come into play). SDtandard HD video even straight off of my 5D Mark III simply looks and plays great, and I'm pretty picky.\n-Image Quality: they claim that videos look better when played back. I was skeptical; not now. They look great and PowerDVD does leverage custom profiles if you have a wide gamut monitor, which I do. And being H.264 compliant is a plus because there's more image data available to enhanced in that compressed format.\n-The app just looks good. I know, seemingly insignificant attribute, but I like a good UX (user experience) and the default skin looks awesome.\n-BluRay support: there are three components to play a BluRay disc due to the built-in digital rights management: 1)the player has to be able to handle the bandwidth, compatibility is not enough. PowerDVD does this extremely well. 2) your monitor must be HDCP compliant, and 3) your graphics card must be HDCP compliant. That means Dual Link DVI or HDMI ports. Otherwise not even PowerDVD can play the BluRay disc on your PC.\n-Windows 8 ready! I'm now running Win8 Pro 64bit and have been hammering away at the user interface, trying to get it to crash, but PowerDVD has basically yawned at me. So far, very stable, even the added Mobile Sync Service it runs (see next line)\n-OK, this is pretty cool: PowerDVD runs a small service in Windows that connects most mobile devices to the PC when on the same network. So I figured this meant that I download an app on my iPhone and it becomes a remote, and that's true. But they've added another feature that really isn't related to running videos: my iPhone becomes a trackpad using the PowerDVD app. Even if I quit PowerDVD it still functions as a trackpad on any app! You have to start PowerDVD to get it going but then can quit it later. Because of the high res screen on the iPhone (I'm sure Droid phones work equally as well), the trackpad is quite precise! The only caveat is I haven't figured out how to right-click.\n-Last thing: Fast. Really fast. The software fires right up with no lag.\n\nCONS\n-The user interface's left-side navigation is somewhat confusing. They made it too cluttered and often you click on something that you think is the right thing and it turns out it isn't. I probably just need to get used to it.\n-Importing assets: when you first fire up the software, it's defaulted to auto-import videos and pictures from your libraries... problem is, it is SLOWWWW. I applaud Cyberlink for attempting a way to give us Digital Asset Management, but to be honest I just want to right-click a video file and have it play, and play well, and THAT is what PowerDVD shines at.\n\nI saw some other reviews where there were complaints that installing version 13 disables version 8. I won't make friends saying this, but why on earth would you want such an old version anyway? Algorithms and CODECS and integration with the latest operating systems have improved drastically in the last few years, I would ditch the old versions with glee. Just my $0.02...\n\nI can't comment on Ultraviolet and 3D, I don't work with those formats or services. I did look up some reviews on PC Mag and others who claim that 3D is handled surprisingly well, but personally I don't know.\n\nI'm psyched, I finally have a player for HD and 4K vid that looks awesome and runs like butter. Forget all of the other bells and whistles, that to me is worth the price of admission.\n\nSystem specs, for those researching and making benchmark comparisons: i7 980, 24GB ram (triple channel), GTX570 card, SSD for C drive and dual 1TB WD RE3s in RAID0 on an LSI PCI RAID card for playback of assets)", "summary": "There Are Some Quirks, but This Is the Best Player I've Used Yet", "unixReviewTime": 1372982400}

As advertised, it is quick and easy ... all except for the parts where you need to think about what you actually want, and that is your problem, not the software's.\n\nIt looks like it will work well for more complicated wills as well, but not having kids, ample assets, a business, or relatives I hate, I can't say for certain.\n\nWillmaker Plus ships with Nolo Press's \"The Legal Answer Book for Families,\" which addresses legal issues in marriage, divorce, child custody, child support, adoption, children (in general), and elder care. I don't have issues in any of these areas (and hope not to), so I can't say how useful the book is. I will say that it is clearly written, and has what appear to be helpful tips and external links, but it's not a lawyer or a law encyclopedia and will not get you too far beyond the basics.\n\nI have not yet tried the \"bonus\" subscription to Nolo's living trust, but will revise once I've had the opportunity.\n\nWhich brings me to a couple of negatives about this product. First, I registered it as instructed, but was then unable to login to retrieve the living trust. This is my fault, because I neglected to record the password. Fortunately, Nolo has the usual capability of resetting your password. Unfortunately, it doesn't work ... or isn't working at the moment. It sends me a reset link, but when I try to use it I'm told that it's expired. Annoying. [This was apparently a temporary glitch; I subsequently received a message with a working link.]\n\nSecond, when I ran through the process of installing Willmaker and creating a simple will (with plans to get a bit more baroque later, after I had spent the time to think through some issues), I was running on a PC that had recently upgraded from Win 7 to Win 10. I subsequently did a clean install of Win 10, and now I get a \"This App Can't Run on Your PC\" message. Clearly, it can run on my PC, but I need tech support to help me get it going.\n\nI will revise this review once I've heard back from Quicken/Nolo on these issues and (I hope) given the living trust and its associated resources a try.\n\nGeneral comment on Nolo: There is nothing comparable to Nolo as a source of legal advice and guidance that is accessible to the general public. They have a well-earned reputation as a reliable source of legal information. On the other hand, their online materials are not all you could hope for. Their \"free legal updates\" tend to be very skimpy, and the related blogs (where they advertise them) tend to have a handful of old posts and nothing else.\n\nGeneral comment on Quicken: These guys are not exactly a model company. Customer support for Willmaker Plus 2016 will only last until the end of the year, assuming they give it the same treatment as Willmaker Plus 2015. By insisting that you must buy a new product every year, they are pushing customers away.\n\nBottom line: If you have a big and/or complicated estate, you should probably turn to your lawyer and your tax adviser instead of a piece of software. If your financial and legal affairs are relatively simple, however, Willmaker Plus could be a good choice for you. Customer support is not marvelous, however, and if you want to revise your will next year and you want it to reflect any relevant changes in the law, you will need to buy next year's version.", "summary": "Mostly as advertised, but with some warts", "unixReviewTime": 1455062400}

So if you want to burn DVD as presentation media, you will need a program like this.\n\nNevertheless, in a world of thumbdrives, memory cards, cloud connections and networked drives, making a program primarily designed to burn your video or data to an optical disc is something of a hard sell. To combat this reality, Toast Titanium 12 for Mac offers more than just burn-to-media capabilities: the software engineers have added file converters for playback on a variety of devices, video sharing capabilities with social media, advanced screen capture, and ripping of audiobooks. Additionally, this program will allow you to burn to Blu-ray discs (something that Apple seems to be avoiding for some reason), if you have an external Blu-ray drive attached to your computer.\n\nToast is an easy to use and mostly successful program, but you will have to assess the features carefully and decide if this is something that you truly need. It is not absolutely necessary for everyone but a small subset of users out there will want a suite of programs like this, designed to burn optical discs and manipulate media.\n\nINSTALLATION\nThe program was easily and quickly installed from the supplied DVD.  (As if to prove the point, though, Amazon either will sell you the media or a direct download.)  Once you input your code and register (optional), you are ready to go.  The opening\n\nDVD/BLUERAY AUTHORING\nIf all you want to do is author media DVDs, this program will definitely do it, but it works no more smoothly than some free and shareware options (e.g. DVD Styler, DVD Flick; note that free options generally don't author Blu-ray discs.).  Neither Toast nor the other DVD authoring options have the elegance of Apple's late iDVD and what you end up with is a more pedestrian, less professional, circa-early-2000s DVD look without much in the way of eye candy or manipulation available.\n\nThe interface is the simple, old-style drop and drag interface. One nice feature, is that the program doesn't try to convert video files right away.  The media browser is light and quick on its feet.  Instead of dragging you down with on-the-fly conversion, it just quickly shows the video clips on your screen and does the conversion later, when it prepares to burn.  Toast's editing features are limited, but it does allow you some advanced manipulations.  For each clip, you can change the text of the title, add chapters, and set audio filters.  You can burn to DVD, Blu-ray\n\nI was disappointed that there was no preview before encoding.  The DVDs produced were functional but bland.  Note, as well, you can burn DVDs, HD-DVDs, and Blu-ray discs, but you need to upgrade to Toast Pro to author HD Blu-ray discs.\n\nAVCHD CAMERA IMPORT\nToast can easily import files from an AVCHD camera.  This is done exactly the same way as authoring a standard DVD, as noted above.\n\nCD/DVD/Blu-ray COPYING\nThis is easy and straightforward.  As a nice bonus, DVD compression can be activated so that you can fit media on one DVD or Blu-ray.  If you have one drive, the program will cache the data before copying.  If you have two drives it will copy one to the other.\n\nThis section can be used to rip data or media off a non-protected disc only.  Whether or not it is legal to make a for-personal-use only back up of a commercial DVD is controversial, but if you want this feature, you will have to buy another program to do this (e.g. a program like RipIt or MDRP).\n\nDATA\nYou can copy data to optical media with a simple drag and drop.  There is little advantage of this over Apple's native functionality (where you just drop files onto a disc), other than Roxio's burning options: Mac only compatibility, Mac and PC, DVD-ROM (UDF), ISO 9660, and Photo Disc formats.  Additionally, Toast allows you to avoid splitting files if spanning two or more discs, add an auto run feature (Windows only), compress the data, or encrypt the data.\n\nSadly, there is not description or ability to manipulate the compression or encryption algorithms.\n\nVIDEO CONVERSION/AUDIO CONVERSION\nAnother drag and drop interface.\n\nBasically, you plop the file you want to convert into the drag area.  Once there, you can specify which part of the clip you want and add filters to the sound.  You can then select from any number of formats compatible with file formats, iPods, iPads, iPhones, android phones, and social media (YouTube, Vimeo, and Facebook).  The file is converted to the proper format.  If you want to upload to social media, you can do this directly by logging into your account.  Toast will even post a link on Twitter for you.  (Note: if you just want video conversion, the free program Handbrake works just fine.  Toast, however, is still a little easier to use.)\n\nFor audio conversion, you can trim the track, add fades, and add sound filters.  You can convert to AIFF, Wav, AAC, Apple Lossless, FLAC, or Ogg Vorbis. The filters are standard Apple filters, but you can manipulate them easily through toast.  Note that the filter will affect the whole track--you can't do fine manipulations of track sections with this program.\n\nThe Track Trim interface is quirky.  You can start or end at at any point within a given track, but trimming is done by time and unlike video there is no playback in the Trim Track window.  Basically, you have to play the track and note the time you want it to start or end and then pop up the Trim Track window and input the times manually.  Strange choice.  You can convert any number of files in a row, but there was no way to merge them into one.\n\nVIDEO CAPTURE\nThis is an easy to use video capture program.  You can specify whole screen capture or capture just a section of the screen.  You can select 'mic' to record your voice.  If you don't it will simply record audio from your computer.  To start, hit record.  To end, hit shift/command/1 (or press the stop/pause button).  The file is saved as a .mov file that can be further converted using Toast.\n\nIn a short test, it performed admirably.  I did try to record streaming video from the web.  This worked reasonably well for short periods of time, but for a >5 minute video the program crashed.  I'll experiment with this some more, but after two crashes, I was a little disappointed.  This could be an OS X Yosemite quirk, however, so I'll try again a little later, as there's bound to be an update.\n\nNote that QuickTime now performs video capture, but for whatever reason Toast is just easier to use.  There are, of course, more advanced screen capture programs, but this one is just fine and\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOnce upon a time, a program like this was essential, but a program that heavily focuses on optical media is now more peripheral.  If you really do need to author DVDs and Blu-ray discs this isn't a bad way to go.  If you just want to manipulate certain kinds of media, you can do a lot with native Apple apps and a number of free or shareware programs out there that might cost you a lot less. For the right user, this program will definitely work.", "summary": "Competent, but at times quirky, software for media manipulation and DVD/Blu-ray authoring", "unixReviewTime": 1414972800}

I had a friend who had more than one of those grrrrr moments with QuickBooks 2010, so for the neophyte to the program this is a real plus. If you've been working with the program for years it will be of no consequence. If you are satisfied with the last couple of QuickBooks versions, I wouldn't recommend upgrading, but otherwise you might want to consider the 2012.\n\nTwo other things, in addition to the actual content, sold me on the viability of the program. One was the access to instant online assistance. I wanted to check out a question I had and when I went to the QuickBooks site there was instant access to a tech. The program is easy to use, but if you do have more complicated FAQs, you can get up to an hour's worth of time with a QuickBooks expert during your first month of use (888-222-7276) . These aspects are perfect for the \"beginner.\" You may also wish to take a look at QuickBooks Pro 2012 to see which program best fits your needs.\n\nI wouldn't say this program is perfect, but there are several new features that are helpful to the average QuickBooks user.\n\n* The calendar feature. You can see invoices that are due on any particular day and and information that was entered. For example, you can see what needs to be done or what has to be done including emails, faxes, and appointments. You can select what you want to see from a drop-down menu from one thing to all transaction. These are details in a panel below the calendar.\n\n* The document center. It's now much easier to attach documents than in the last version of QuickBooks and at no cost (it came out in 2010). You can add a document from your computer, scan one, or drag one in. For example you can drag in a picture copy of a check to go with your invoice. These do need a separate backup that is not provided.\n\n* The Lead Center (under customers in the drop-down menu). You can add your lead information (lead name, status, company name, main phone). You can add many things such as Facebook, Twitter, Skype, phone numbers, etc. When you want to contact them you can put them in your calendar. There is also a place you can make notes on the lead. If they become a customer, you can just click in the corner and the information will go into your customer base. You can also import your other leads.\n\n* Batch Timesheet Entry Function. Timetracking must be enabled, time data needs to be turned on for all employees you want included, and you need to use the Weekly Timesheet Function. This function is a bit tricky because of the prerequisites and necessary similarities in pay. For example, the employees need to be working on the same job and be putting in the same number of hours. There are online tutorials that are very helpful when you wish to implement this extremely useful feature.\n\n* A list of memorized transactions. There is a detailed list of what you may or many not choose to be entered into your program. You can choose when you want to enter them.\n\n* To Do List. These can be arranged by type (calling, faxing, emailing, appointment). They can also be prioritized and there is a notes section to use.\n\n* The ability to export reports to Excel so that they can be formatted is a very nice feature. You can update an existing spreadsheet. The information can be pull from QuickBooks into Excel.\n\n* Wildcard Search. When you go into the customer center you can narrow down and select certain customers. For example, if you want to find a list of active customers, but don't know a particular name you can do a keyword search. If you know the customer's name is Joe just enter it in and his information will come up. You don't even need an exact match to get a hit.\n\nLike anything, it depends on what you are looking for and the reason you need it. If you want a place where you can centrally organize your records and have them ready come tax time this is probably a program that will do just that. If you want online billpay included, don't bother because it isn't here. I love many of the new features and so do many of my friends. If you have a small business, I think you might wish to add this one to your list. The learning curve is not steep, the program is fun to play around with, and there are many online tutorials in addition to the expert help from QuickBooks. If what you need is in the program, I'd highly recommend it.", "summary": "There are several new features is QuickBooks 2012 that will make you take a closer look at the software ...", "unixReviewTime": 1323302400}

The first thing I liked is the desktop has very few changes and I can continue to use it just like was in Windows 7. That was quite comforting. I had created a disk image and recovery disk in case I wanted to go back to Windows 7. Within 10 minutes I knew I wouldn't go back.\n\nThe Start Screen offers fun full screen or split screen applications. It extends Windows into the world that has become familiar to me when I'm using my iPod Touch. I think Microsoft is doing exactly the right thing by blending the touch screen world of apps with the traditional wide spread Windows application environment. When I buy a convertible tablet/laptop I'll have the best of both worlds, a touch screen tablet, and the ability to run all of my applications like MS Excel, Quicken, TurboTax and others.\n\nI don't have trouble with the learning curve, I think within 20 minutes I was able to do everything I wanted including finding things like the Control Panel.\n\nMy complaints so far are a couple of little things but they bother me...\n\nFirst when I bring the computer out of sleep mode it doesn't come up in the login screen where I can just type my password. It comes up in a new screen showing a digital clock and some information like a mail message all on a user selectable background. I have to click Return to get to the password screen. This may seem little but I just don't know why it is important to have this other screen. At least they could allow me to disable it but I haven't found that option if it exists.\n\nSecond the new File Explorer has some nice features but they removed a feature that I used all the time and there is no decent way to get the same function back. When viewing photo thumbnails in the Windows 7 Explorer I was able to see the thumbnails, a large image of the photo, and at the bottom of the screen some details from the file such as the camera aperture setting. That details bar on the bottom is gone. You now have an option to view the large photo OR details but not both. This is a big disappointment to me.\n\nThe rest of the changes, and there are a lot, will just take some time to get used to but as I said just staying with the desktop is quite similar to the Windows 7 environment so it is easy to use.\n\nNow that I have Windows 8 Pro for only $39.99 upgrade price I will be ready to buy a convertible tablet and have the same OS on both platforms.

What's more, the user interface applies to all of their language modules so learners of multiple RS language modules will be comfortable and at home with the \"dynamic immersion\" approach.\n\nAt best, the RS Mandarin will train you to be conversational in Mandarin. It will not allow you to recognize and write Chinese characters easily- that is an entirely different discipline better served by other instructional approaches. It is possible to speak and not be able to read the characters at this stage.\n\nMandarin is hard language to speak for most westerners. The 4 primary pronunciation tones (see Wiki's Pinyin article for an excellent overview) sound subtle to western tongues and are very hard to pronounce for the typical English speaker. This is because the way the mouth (lips, tongue, breathing) moves in pronouncing Mandarin is completely different to speaking English. My wife, an American from the South who speaks English with a somewhat relaxed and dragged out accent, has incredible difficulty in discerning the tonal differences, let alone pronouncing them accurately. Discerning and learning these tonal differences is crucial to successful conversational Mandarin. If you remember the 70's-80's Kung-Fu movies, they sometimes have a Westerner as a sparring combatant and they will sometimes speak some Mandarin in between the flying punches. To the Mandarin speaker, it always sounds really funny because they have typically messed up the tonal inflections. For example, \"ma\" can mean mother, horse, to scold, to wipe, a question, measles, etc., when used with the correct tone and context. So, to avoid speaking \"Kung-Fu Mandarin\" (comical and embarrassing in a business meeting, but at least it gets them smiling), it is essential to listen to the Mandarin speakers on the RS software very very carefully and practice repeatedly. That said, the speakers on the RS software have clear excellent accents but the microphone pronunciation feedback tool is not tight enough and will tolerate tonal mis-pronunciations.\n\nIf you are learning Mandarin alone, it would be very helpful to still seek a native Mandarin speaker. It helps to observe the mouth when pronouncing the words (I wish RS would have avi's of the speaker's mouth up close as a pronouncing aid). It also helps to be corrected immediately to avoid entrenching bad habits. And if you are finding an instructor, get an educated person that speaks with a proper accent. You want the Beijing news reader quality. China is a large country and speakers from different parts of China have very different accents. For example, speakers from HK or Canton will often speak (if they even can!) Mandarin that is heavily tinged with a Cantonese accent.  No point learning that. Should you be discouraged? No!!! If you are in China or get Chinese cable programs, you will notice some westerners on the language and outreach programs.

A.", "verified": false, "reviewText": "Overview\n\nThis is a great array for someone looking to expand their home storage network or possibly someone with a SOHO setup that needs plenty of storage. I used this array to combine many different drives I had laying around from past system builds as well as to give me a central place to go for over 15TB of storage.\n\nUnpacking\n\nThe array arrived well packed with two layers of boxes and internal Styrofoam.\n\nInstallation\n\nYou will definitely want to buy the optional rackmount mounting rails. The railkit costs approximately $32 more but was worth not having to sit the array on top of another rackmount device. There is no way the front brackets will hold the weight of the array empty let alone full of hard drives.\n\nHardware\n\nAll hardware was included. eSATA cables, SATA cables, power cables, drive trays, and drive tray mounting screws were included. The chassis is reasonably high quality metal, and I believe the power supply is a standard ATX power supply which is always preferred over some custom form factor so that if the OE PS dies you can get another one from anywhere. The array has plenty of fans, so far I have 12 drives in the array and no cooling issues.\n\nThe array is surprisingly quiet even when fully populated with WD Caviar Greens. The fans are barely noticeable to include the power supply fan. The indicator lights on the front are sparse but do provide basic information such as which drive bays are filled, which drives are active, and which internal RAID controller is active. A nice to have would have been a LCD screen with temp and other environmental info but at this price point its not surprising that its lacking.\n\nOne HW feature that I found totally cool was that you can bring your own eSATA port multiplying RAID controller card if you wanted, disable the RAID controller in the array, and use all of your own features with your own RAID controller card.\n\nSoftware\n\nThe CD that came with mine was useless, trying to read it locked up two different laptops so I ended up downloading the latest software right from their website. The GUI interface for their drives and software is terrible, incredibly cheesy, and felt like something developed in the 90's, but it did install without a hitch and instantly recognized the attached array. Configuration of the RAID went without a hitch.\n\nI did all of my configurations from a server running Windows Server 8 BETA x64 so I can say its not only Windows Server 8 BETA compatible its also 64bit compatible driver software.\n\nA nice feature is that the HD's SMART monitoring information is available via the array's driver software.\n\nFeatures\n\nThe amount of storage options this unit provides is awesome. I was looking for a budget eSATA rackmount enclosure with at least 8 drive bays and this unit definitely performs above and beyond my expectations. It offers all the usual RAID levels but the best part is that internally it is comprised of 3 separate RAID controllers which are accessible via 3 separate eSATA ports on the back so if you wanted to you could connect 3 different servers to this array. Also, if you choose to connect a device to the array that does not have a port multiplier eSATA port, you can configure the internal controller of the array to do the port multiplication for you and present a single logical storage volume to the connected device.\n\nDuring my burn-in testing of my 2TB WDC Green RAID array I saw sustained writes of approximately 86MB/s and reads of approximately 98MB/s for a RAID 5 array of 4 1TB WDC Greens.\n\nThe Bad\n\nThe only bad thing about this array is the incredibly cheap hard drive carriages. You have to be very careful when mounting, inserting, or removing hard drives from this array. The carriages are very fragile, thin, plastic and will easily crack or break if handled roughly.  Once the drives are properly inserted into the array you should be ok.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is a great budget minded eSATA RAID enclosure for anyone seeking a ton of drive bays, HW RAID controllers, and storage flexibilty for less than $1000.00.

I run a Macbook Pro (previously a 17\" from 2008, now a 15\" with Retina Display) mostly because they're well done and because of Parallels (and now VMware Fusion) allow me to run Windows at the same time without having to dual-boot it.\n\nAll the major functions work well and as expected. Once set up, you're able to run the host OS with the VM OS at the same time and, as you'd expect, performance is based on how well your machine is ready to handle two OSes (memory, CPU, HD space, etc.).\n\nInstall:\n\nOne thing to note. My new MBP is on Mountain Lion (wonder if the next release is going to be Cougar or Sabertooth?) and apparently version 4 out of the box (I've had this for about a month now so they might have fixed this with the current stock) won't install. You have to go to the support site, register (for obvious reasons) and you can download the proper installer (4.1. X). You need to register since the installer is a full installer, not a patch. Once you're registered it's currently under Support & Downloads > Product Downloads > All Downloads > VMware Fusion (right column mid-way down). The link is here but bear in mind this might change:\n\n[...]\n\nOnce you've got that downloaded, it'll install just fine.\n\nRetina Display + Windows 7 (and others?):\n\nAnother problem I had was screen resolution. Retina displays, if you aren't aware, effectively mean you've got double the original/standard resolution (basically twice as many pixels). That's what gives the displays the clarity (more pixels per square inch = better resolution). Unfortunately, this apparently doesn't translate well into Windows in fullscreen mode, at least as of this writing. There are a couple of workarounds so it's not the end of the world and it appears that working in windowed mode (and in a sense in Unity since Unity's got to scale to the Mac OS anyway). Not the end of the world, as I said but definitely something that will need to be worked around until they patch the software.\n\n[...]\n\nUnity/Windowed Mode Switching:\n\nThis is a minor gripe if only because it felt a lot easier in Parallels. Switching between Fullscreen, Unity and Windowed Mode is a bit odd. It takes some getting used to (you'd think a couple of well-placed tip bubbles would've been part of your initial experience with the app). They've got two different buttons in different places. It took me a little bit to get used to. Again, minor but you'd sort of think it might be a great design concept to just put them together and in a consistent location so you can just find it fast and do what you need to do. In addition, once you switch to Unity mode, you basically lose the Windows desktop. You'll have to pull up the Windowed Mode to find stuff, including taskbar items. There's a start menu in the Mac OS site with Fusion but I don't see a usable taskbar (I might be missing it). Again, this is just a pet peeve and might not amount to anything for you.\n\nAll in all, it does what it's supposed to do and appears to do it well. I haven't tried 3D graphics/gaming with it yet so I can't really speak to that. Compared to Parallels, honestly, they both have all the same major features. I feel like Parallels did a better job of handling the \"mixed mode\" between the two OSes but I don't have a recent version (last version I used was 4 or 5). However, if you're wondering in general if Fusion will work for you, I can say it will. VMware's been doing VMs for a very long time. A decent amount of cloud infrastructure is running on VMware (though, obviously, not Fusion).\n\nSo, while I can't give you a good Parallels versus VMware comparison with current versions, I can say VMware should deliver what you need if you want to host Windows on a Mac. Just remember a couple things: a) you need to own a copy of Windows to run a VM with it, and b) you should have enough resources on your Mac to give up some to run a VM--there's no magic here...VMs run on whatever resources you allocate to them so giving them 1 CPU with 500MB of RAM and 10 GB of hard disk will mean it'll run fine if all you want to do is check e-mail. At minimum, pony up for more RAM and a nice sized hard disk, especially if you're going to run Windows 7 (I recommend allocating the min requirements depending on the version you're running). You can still run on less than minimum resources, it'll just be a slow ride.", "summary": "Does the job well, though retina display can pose a problem", "unixReviewTime": 1344988800}

It has been around since the early 1990s as a GUI (Graphical User Interface) front end for PKZIP, the data compression utility that had been authored by the late Phil Katz. I note this as two people asked me about ZIP files in the last couple months. So much for the brief history lesson.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/WinZip-18-Pro/dp/B00GDF83SM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">WinZip 18 Pro</a>&nbsp;is the latest version of WinZip, and is a full-featured product, with a lot of good functionality. It does an excellent job opening and extracting ZIP, Zipx, 7Z, LHA/LZH, RAR, BZ2 and about all of the other major compression file formats of which you can think. It makes fast work of converting Microsoft Word docs (and other Office files) to PDF format, and it's easy to create them as read-only PDF if you want to avoid file alteration by other parties.\n\nThis version offers more that the older&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/WinZip-17-Standard/dp/B009RG41HQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">WinZip 17 Standard</a>&nbsp;and other variations in that it makes it easier to protect your privacy and share files in email messages, in social media, and on the cloud. It has been redesigned to support new add-ons, and cloud navigation makes it simpler to protect, manage and share your files online. An updated Zip engine makes even smaller ZIP and Zipx files.\n\nNow you can display photos within ZIP files without extracting them by using WinZip's internal image viewer, and you can use the 'Photos' button to rapidly transfer photos from supported cameras and iPhones, then rotate and compress them into picture shows for sharing. Among the new features, you can use direct access to cloud services. These include Google Drive, SkyDrive (now Cloud Drive), and Dropbox, which I've tried successfully. You can also access other cloud services such as  Box, CloudMe and SugarSync, though I have not tried these. You can also send links to your cloud files via instant messaging, email and social media with the Cloud Links feature.\n\nIf you have a large number of digital images on your hard drive, it will reduce your .JPG files by about 20 to 25% with no loss of photo quality or data integrity. Photographers with a large number of images should note that WinZip may (or may not) cause some issues with image management/viewing applications such as Adobe Photoshop Lightroom or Nikon ViewNX 2, so run some tests before you try to compress all of your images. I have not tried compressing RAW images, as keeping them intact is a personal thing.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/WinZip-18-Pro/dp/B00GDF83SM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">WinZip 18 Pro</a>&nbsp;is available here on CD-ROM or as a PC download for Windows 7, Vista and Windows 8.x.

I notice it with my high definition screen and surround sound versus other programs.  My DvDs seem to look and sound better also all features on the blu-rays seem to work where they don't on other programs.\n\nCons: It's getting better, that or my computer is getting faster over the years but they add A LOT of features and options for opening media that most people won't use. They need to program it with extensions or something so it's not a complex mess of a million features and options.\n\nNotes:\n-The high price across blu-ray is because how overly complicated they make it and the companies that support it have to constantly update and maintain their software for the life of the product. (Anytime the studios or blu-ray forces a change the companies have to patch or update their software in order to work with the new blu-ray methods)\n\n-Blu-rays have software on them that run through the program and check via internet or a local database.  This complex system is costly when it comes to players and software that plays them.\n\n-Companies have to price the cost of maintenance for the lifetime of the product.  (Blu-ray pushes out updates every couple months, calculate that over years and it adds up the price to keep the player/software in compliance.)\n\n-Blu-rays are constantly adding new features (lots of these features requires money and licensing, this is why most blu-ray companies will have yearly versions.  (Same with players, (newer models) with the new features) This complex costly system is why most companies don't include blu-ray support or they don't provide any of the top notch features, quality or sound.\n\nIs it right for blu-ray and the studios to do this? I myself think it's not fair but we have to pay the price and deal with it till the digital market gets into full swing with higher quality.\n\nSupport:\nThis company does a decent job at support but with so many strict blu-ray standards if you have an issue sometimes it has nothing to do with their software.\n\nTHEY HAVE A PROGRAM CALLED BD / 3D ADVISER, ON THEIR WEBSITE (RUN THIS BEFORE YOU BUY THE SOFTWARE!!!!)\n\nI recommend checking the following first:\n-CHECK YOUR BLU-RAY firmware for updates (need to go to the support page for your blu-ray drive)\n-Check if your Video Drivers are up to date.\n-Check if you're using a HD connection, HDMI, DVI, etc to your screen if it's a desktop.\n-Sound drivers are up to date\n-For windows the required .net is updated and patched.\n-Internet connection (for advance features)\n-If your sound is dull make sure your surround sound or speakers are using HD digital or optical connection.", "summary": "This software gets a lot of hate and misunderstanding and I understand why but let me ...", "unixReviewTime": 1386806400}

It has always been a better choice than the other options out there, especially since some of those have become fat, sluggish media suites and have forgotten their roots.\n\nNero has also fattened up, but several of its components are still very usable and useful. Why then does this product rate only 1-star?\n\nDespite all of the positive features, and there are many, there is at least one feature that makes this product totally unacceptable with a warning of Do Not Buy. Note that this feature may not apply to everyone, and there are lots of users who will never face this situation. But for those whom it affects, it is a disaster that you will have no control over, and it can utterly destroy your media library.\n\nHere is what happened to me  when I opened the Media Home feature of the software it automatically searched my drive and ALL connected drives and automatically (and without my permission) converted numerous files and resaved them, overwriting my original file. This starts happening immediately, and as a typical user I have no idea what was happening at first. I started poking around in the options menu and learned that the program is set to change file names and formats by default and you have to manually turn that feature off.\n\nSo, in real terms, is this a deal-breaker? Yes. The first time I started Nero Media Home it started searching my attached backup drive and converting irreplaceable media files, some of which I had collected over as long as 15 years, into their acceptable format. Every one of them became a 291kb Nero format file, never to be opened by any other app ever again. So despite Nero advertising that their media player will play anything I tried to open those 291kb files (which is impossibly small to contain audio, video or photo information) and the app informed me that the file could not be opened. That it is corrupted and unusable. And I was left with countless worthless media files.\n\nI immediately uninstalled the entire software suite when I saw what was happening and threw it in the trash. Please understand that you may buy, use and love this app and this may not affect you. Only those of us who have an archive of media files that Nero decides to convert on its own and without permission will consider this software to be unacceptable. If you're not sure, its a big risk to take. Too big!\n\nTo be fair, someone who said they represent Nero responded to my review basically saying what I described is impossible and that I should contact tech support but they didn't give me a service ticket number or escalation contact. However I already ditched the software so thats not much help. I'm surprised at their denial that there's a problem. That type feedback from them seems to be consistent throughout the other 1-star reviews (which seem to have a trend of getting not-helpful votes from \"someone\") while, as others have pointed out, it seems most of the 5-star reviews are only a few words long about how they love the product but those reviews lack any useful details why they love it so much. I did re-write my review to assure my experience is described honestly and accurately, whether Nero chooses to accept that fact or not, and as a previously happy long-time Nero user who has to this point said many positive things about them, I'm disappointed.\n\n[IMPORTANT UPDATE]  after upgrading to WIN10 I thought I would give this software another chance, after all how could they keep selling it if it was so bad? I realize that most people only have a handful of photos, videos and songs on their computers these days and most people won't care if Nero decides to optimize their files. I installed Nero under controlled conditions (I unplugged all of my external drives first and made sure I didn't have anything important on my main hard drive. Sure enough the same thing happened to me as the first time I tested it. As soon as I connected a drive with pictures, videos and songs on it, Nero went to work to optimize them. This time I knew how to stop it before it destroyed everything and I took the time to take screen-shots before I uninstalled Nero (I was using a newer copy of the same version as I previously threw away).  Why would I care if my photos are turned into low-res JPEGs? Well, I purposely work with my files in both RAW and PNG so I can edit multiple layers in a non-destructive mode. Once the files are reduced to low-res JPEGs they are useless to me. Also  I have in excess of 50,000 photos on my hard drives. Nero wants to put them all into an album for me. That works for people who have maybe 100 photos on their computer. The last thing in the world I want is a photo album with 50,000 pictures in it.  BTW, once installed it is IMPOSSIBLE to remove just the MediaHome app by itself, so you cant just keep an app that may be actually useful like the burning ROM app.", "summary": "Using this suite can be a major risk to some people", "unixReviewTime": 1434844800}

It didn't win me back over.  I find the iolo System Mechanic interface easier to navigate, and their software doesn't cause any problems.

(I build my own PCs.)  It's an AMD Phenom II 965BE-based machine running Windows 7 Professional.  I allowed Norton Utilities to make some of its suggested changes.  Then various programs stopped working.  Norton deleted several .dll files that it contended were extraneous.  However, programs needed them.  Adobe Reader stopped working, among others.  I had to repair several program installations after allowing Norton to savage my system.

Norton, on the other hand, wants to treat SSDs like mechanical hard disks.  Bad news.  Norton badly needs to improve their software to address newer technologies.\n\nThe Norton software doesn't seem as resource intensive now, but it just doesn't compare to other products I've used recently in terms of general trustworthiness.

It works but Intuit keeps changing the interface each year which drives me nuts. Its the same problem with Quicken, changing the user interface and often making it worse. The 2007 version of TurboTax seemed to be one of the harder versions to use in my opinion. Usually I want to make a quick pass through my taxes to see roughly where I stand. The 2007 version made this quick pass very difficult because it was insistent on making me enter data when I just wanted to skip screens. I'd have to go back about 4 or 5 years to find a version that I thought was best. It will be interesting if the beta testers are right and they improve it this year.\n\nTurboTax is supposed to be able to import data from Quicken. I gave up using that feature several years ago because the linkage between the two programs was a royal pain. If I did the import on one computer then tried to finish my return on a second computer it wouldn't work at all. I was forced to continue using the first computer. Further TurboTax was fussy about how I entered my data in Quicken and to get it right I had to keep going back to Quicken to make changes and reimport.

I expect something along the lines of Apple's iMovie, and hopefully better.\n\nI installed this on one of my Windows 8.1 computers, an Asus laptop with a 17\" screen, 8gb RAM, and a 1.83gHz Baytrail-M processor. A speed demon this is not, and its lack of a dedicated video card seriously slows down video processing. With that in mind, it's still hard not to get frustrated when PowerDirector lags and freezes, but keeping expectations in check, I find I am more annoyed with odd little bugs that happened frequently. The worst of these bugs was the play head, and accompanying video, jumping to the end of the video timeline while the audio played where it should be. This happened over and over while editing a video, making it impossible to preview effects and transitions.\n\nBut onto the good: PowerDirector keeps things pretty simple. Import your video, then click to select and drag the clips you want onto the timeline. Once there, video is easily trimmed simply by dragging from either end of the clip to shorten the video. Place the playhead where you want to cut a video and click \"Split.\" The result is two pieces of the same video that can be moved or deleted independently.\n\nI was initially a little thrown off once I'd trimmed my video to the needed lengths: where are all the video and audio editing tools? Turns out they're hidden away, sort of. Select a video and you'll note a banner of buttons appears above the timeline section. Most notable is the Fix/Enhance. Select this and what I was looking for is here - color correction, lighting adjustments, white balance, and stabilization. Each of these gives you deeper control over the image, but, at least on my computer, they can be slow to apply (and un-apply in order to see the difference.) Here is where Premiere shines - each effect has its own on-off switch while PowerDirector only toggles all of the changes made in a given section. It's not the worst thing, but it does make things just a tad more frustrating.\n\nStabilization is handled quite well, correcting a very wobbly bit of video with very little of the sloshy effect that stabilization can have.\n\nThere are transitions galore, from the basic fade to 3D. Select one, drag it down to the point that it needs to be utilized - and this is much more fiddly than I've experienced before. It needs to be placed right at the very beginning or end to snap into place. Anywhere else and you have to go back and reselect it. There is very little forgiveness when it comes to placing transitions in PowerDirector. Zooming in on the timeline using the slider in the lower left of the program may help with this.\n\nExporting your video is done through the Produce pane, and you are offered a plethora of choices here. Many different formats and settings for each one. This could be overwhelming for a new user. PowerDirector defaulted back to the original file format here, why I don't know - I don't want it back in a format for the camera. Also available here are direct uploads to favorite video hosting sites - YouTube, Vimeo, etc. I simply exported my video as mp4, and a 12-minute video is going to need a bit over 2 hours to render.\n\nI wouldn't choose PowerDirector over Premiere, but at home, for simple video editing, it's a decent enough program. Apple iMovie keeps things simpler, but PowerDirector offers more options, but it's pretty close in approach. Were the choice up to me, I'd probably choose Premiere Elements because not only does it have a familiar interface for me, there is a lot more online user support for Premiere than PowerDirector.

In truth, there is very little difference between the looks (and featuers) of Office 97 and Office 2003 other than Outlook.  This is both good and bad.  It is good because upgrading is easier because you are already familiar with the user interface.  It is bad, because it leaves very little room for innovation which is why I'm rarely ready to rush out and upgrade my versions of Office.\n\nMicrosoft has decided this time around to not look like 2003 and I say this is all for the better.\n\nBut as an IT professional, I warn ALL of my users that upgrading does come with a learning curve and there is a difference in compatibility you need to be mindful of.  I would give anybody considering an upgrade the same advice.\n\nI would like to mention the compatibility issues.  The standard \"save\" option will save your document in a format incompatible with previous versions.  This is similar to how Access 2000/2003 does not work with Access 97 databases.  Well, they have done this all over again except that you can open and save previous formats quite easily.  Just be mindful that when you save a Word or Excel document you need to save it in the prior format if you wish to share it with others.  You may need to do this for SEVERAL YEARS because I don't see this office being adopted quickly.  However, unlike the Access 2000/97 incompatibility, you can open, work in, AND SAVE Access 2000 databases.  I wish they had done this when Access 2000 first came out.  Thank you, Microsoft!!!\n\nThe interface is now completely different, especially since the toolbars at the top of the screen are named differently.  However, I like how your icons change depending on which toolbar you are working in which puts a lot of your features at the top of your screen without sacrificing desktop real estate.  I must admit, I have had to hunt for some things before (hmmm... where would sort and pivot table be?) but I've never had to hunt for too long.\n\nLike every release of Outlook, this version has taken on a few changes.  And like every prior release, I love them!!!  Their current layout allows for viewing your Email, folders, calendar, and to-do list all on the same screen.  Navigation is quite easy and visiting your contacts couldn't be easier.  My only complaint is the notes... I wish they had done notes like they had done Contacts but they give you a little icon on the bottom of your screen that I often confuse with the \"folder list\" icon sitting next to it.  I hope Microsoft fixes that in a future patch/service pack.\n\nHere is something else I've never said of previous versions... it has actually made my documents look better.  A lot better.  Formatting of text and columns has never been easier.  I use styles quite often and they aren't the \"blah\" standard ones anymore... the styles have evolved tremendously and my documents look great because of that.  Also, there was an ability to alternate shading in Excel but if you had to change orders or copy and paste it would ruin the shading and you had to re-do the shading all over again.  Now it keeps it just the way you want it... even on a cut and paste!!!\n\nDespite the learning curve, I love this new version of Office and have no regrets switching over to it.  I think this has brought Office to a whole new level that no previous version has ever done before.  I can't believe I'm saying/typing this, but my hats off to Microsoft for coming out with a truly superior product.", "summary": "The Next Generation of Office Productivity", "unixReviewTime": 1188864000}

Software is supposed to be USEFUL.  Users don't want to have to go through a whole series of clicks to do ANYTHING. And we don't want to have a FINANCIAL program sending things to all sorts of other programs.  A VIEWER should show a USEFUL VIEW.\n\nUPDATE: I WOUND UP UNINSTALLING 2014 AND I REINSTALLED 2011.\n\nUPDATE RE REINSTALLING 2011. Just a warning about THAT. For several months I continued using 2011 and it worked the same as always. Fortunately, I have two copies (same computer), one under Win 7 and one under Win 8 -- using the same data files. I have mainly been using Win 8. A recent auto software update on the Win 8 copy CHANGED HOW 2011 WORKS. Now, for PDF's, even 2011 automatically opens the system's default PDF viewer. It's definitely a software update because I tried the copy installed under Win 7 and that one doesn't do it.  (What I'll probably have to do is uninstall and reinstall the Win 8 copy and make sure I only run it off-line so it can't reinstall the update.) (Don't blame Win 8 or the \"Metro\" interface. Both Win versions are set up with Classic Shell menu, boot directly to the desktop and look and work almost identically.)\n\nRE GOING BACK FROM 2014 TO 2011:\n\nThis is to clarify some reviews saying people who went from 2011 to 2014 can't go back.  IT DEPENDS. When I initially installed 2014, before doing that I made two complete copies of my data folder on a different hard disk as backups. To go back to 2011, I just renamed the folder that 2014 converted from \"Quicken\" to \"Quicken 2014\" and then copied one of the two backups and named that back to \"Quicken\". I reran the Quicken 2011 installer. Everything installed, and when I opened the program it even immediately found the data--it didn't even ask where it was located even though I don't store it in a default location. Although you can't CONVERT 2014 format to 2011 or open a 2014 data file with 2011, it is NOT true that once you install 2014 it is impossible to use 2011. Of course, if you \"jumped in\" and didn't bother making appropriate backups -- it's your own fault for being careless.\n\nI only use Quicken to keep my checkbook and I download the QFX files and import them from my computer, so I probably really won't need to update.\n\nTWO SUGGESTIONS FOR THE DEVELOPERS:\n\n1) Put back a viewer like in 2011, at least as an option. People don't want either to see a microscopic image or having files open all over the place in a bunch of different programs. A file viewer that can display PDF's and the common image formats--GIF, PNG, JPG, TIFF--isn't that big a deal.\n\n2) PLEASE change Find and Find and Replace to allow for TWO search parameters. For instance, for years I have paid one place $67 a week by check. It would be a HUGE timesaver to be able to put [Amount exactly 67.00] AND [Payee starts with \"Check\"]. Instead, I have to search for \"Amount exactly 67.00\" and then scroll through HUNDREDS of entries where I already changed the Payee name.", "summary": "The new attachment option is a JOKE !!!", "unixReviewTime": 1381708800}

That worked very well at each hand and each level. But for the younger crowd, they definitely wanted to show that there is more for a Mac generation, or a Ipod era as well. That is definitely the case with Windows 8. It is definitely Microsoft's latest attempt at trying to go after a younger crowd.

If you are initially learning this software, you should start off just using the \"Adjust\" tab and not use the \"Edit\" tab; the \"Adjust\" tab is simplified and suitable to novices whereas the \"Edit\" tab is meant for power users.\n\nI have always been a fan of PaintShop Pro throughout the 1990s and I have often kept updating PSP versions after Corel acquired its original developer, JASC Software, in 2004, even though I also have been updating versions of CorelDRAW Graphics Suite starting from CorelDRAW 5.  Along with recently releasing the new&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Corel-AfterShot-Pro/dp/B006WVR9GY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Corel AfterShot Pro</a>&nbsp;this year (after Corel acquired Bibble Labs and repackaged their \"Bibble Pro\" as \"AfterShot Pro\") and also the newly updated&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/CorelDRAW-Graphics-Suite-X6/dp/B007IWCQ8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X6</a>, which includes Corel's original photo-editor called \"Photo-Paint\", Corel now has three photo applications which have some overlapping functions and also unique abilities of their own.  As a photo management application, AfterShot Pro is meant to complement PaintShop Pro and compete against Adobe Photoshop Lightroom.  I previously used both of Corel's PaintShop Pro and Corel's Photo-Paint software for photo editing, and even though recent versions of PaintShop Pro run slower than Photo-Paint due to code bloat from an ever-increasing set of features, PaintShop Pro remains my favorite \"Photoshop for the non-professional-graphics masses\" application, being more feature-packed and capable like Photoshop CS than Adobe's own&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Adobe-Photoshop-Elements-10/dp/B005MMMT6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Adobe Photoshop Elements 10</a>.\n\nWhat is in the box package of this PaintShop Pro X4 Ultimate edition?\n\n Software CD (for Windows 7/Vista/XP)\n Leaflet with WinZip Pro download instructions and activation code.\n Leaflet with Blurb.com coupon code for a $33.95 discount off a photo book that you create from the Blurb.com Web site.\n Leaflet with Fotolia coupon code that may be used to download 21 photos from that site.\n 186-page User Guide\n\nThe PaintShop Pro X4 product features are described and rated below:\n\n Design & Features:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating:\n\n After Corel acquired JASC Software, they have been adding new features with each release, and even though this version runs and feels slower than earlier versions of PSP, I feel that it is a fair trade-off to allow the code bloat due to the number and complexity of features to slow the software down.  With this latest X4 version, I get a powerful set of photo and graphics editing tools that is more useful than Photoshop Elements 10.  PaintShop Pro X4 pales in comparison to the power of the full-blown Photoshop CS, but with its significantly lower pricing and learning curve compared to Photoshop CS, it is obviously meant to compete against software like Photoshop Elements, which it handily outperforms.  The rich set of tools included in PaintShop Pro range from very specific goal-oriented adjustments like the new \"Selective Focus\" tool that simulates the effect of tilt-shift lenses to tools that are very friendly to use by newbies such as 'One Step Photo Fix', 'Smart Photo Fix', and 'One Step Noise Removal'.  This \"Ultimate\" version of PaintShop Pro X4 adds even more power and value by including the award-winning Nik Color Efex Pro 3.0 photographic filters, which includes 52 photographic filters that can be applied to images to give them special effects.  Also included in this Ultimate version is a collection of \"Picture Tubes\", which are thematic collections of graphics that can be painted onto an image to add more bling to your images, frames, and borders.  To help you navigate through the plethora of tools and effects, a very useful 'Effect Browser' lets you try out the various effects, instead of accessing each effect one by one.  One thing that I noticed was that the dialog box window for the 'Effect Browser' has not been updated to match the stylish new user interface, and it still has the old Windows-expanding-folder-tree appearance of old PaintShop Pro versions.\n\n The new HDR (High Dynamic Range) \"Exposure Merge\" tool is Corel's foray into HDR software, which Adobe and other graphics software vendors are also incorporating into their tools.  HDR processing involves combining multiple exposures of the exact same shot (which is easier if your camera has an Automatic Exposure Bracketing (AEB) function) to create a high dynamic range photo which can display a higher tonal range than what the camera is capable of capturing in a single exposure.  There are various software specifically dedicated to HDR processing.  For the past four years, since version 3 in 2008, I have been using the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Photomatix-Pro-4/dp/B002CIP12U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Photomatix Pro 4</a>&nbsp;software for HDR processing.  On a relative scale specifically rating its HDR functions, I would rate Photomatix 5 fuzzy stars while this PaintShop Pro X4's new HDR \"Exposure Merge\" tool only gets 3 fuzzy stars rating.  Both Corel and Adobe still have a long way to catch up with the powerful and flexible offerings in Photomatix.  In particular, I found the \"Exposure Merge\" tool in this version of PaintShop Pro X4 to be lacking in its ability to precisely align bracketed photos and thoroughly and flexibly remove ghosting artifacts, which is something that Photomatix does a very good job at.  If you use a tripod-mounted camera to shoot bracketed photos where nothing in the scene moves the least bit, then the \"Exposure Merge\" tool consistently outputs good HDR results.  But when shooting portraits or landscapes, or shooting hand-held, bracketed photos often have misaligned objects and/or moving objects in the shots.  Even bracketed portrait shots of a person using a tripod can result in tiny movements by the person that require excellent alignment and deghosting by HDR software, and Photomatix currently beats PaintShop Pro's \"Exposure Merge\" tool in this area.  PaintShop Pro's \"Exposure Merge\" tool frequently has ghosting artifacts leftover either from movement of the camera by the photographer or movement of objects in the scene.  This ghosting is especially evident in scenes such as landscapes where various plants may be moving in the breeze or portraits where the subject has slightly moved in between each bracketed shot.  Photomatix also includes a plethora of other tone mapping, image stacking, and on-the-fly editing adjustments, including being able to define specific areas of photos to deghost and specific areas of photos where I can use the original image instead of the HDR output.  I use these Photomatix functions a lot because I always aim for very natural-looking HDR images, instead of the surreal psychedelic HDR images that are, all too often, output by people.  HDR software can be abused to create unnatural over-saturated photos that become tiresome to look at.  Using Photomatix on an image of people set against a beautiful background landscape, I can tell the software to use an original un-HDR'ed exposure of a photo for the people's faces while letting the software HDR-process the rest of the landscape, and this is very useful to me because HDR-processed skin tones can sometimes look unnatural.  PaintShop Pro's \"Exposure Merge\" tool cannot perform these functions that I described.  So a good HDR workflow would be to HDR-process your bracketed photos first using Photomatix, and then further edit the HDR output in PaintShop Pro, perhaps performing some sharpening as the last step before saving the files.\n\n The new \"Photo Blend\" tool lets you merge the best aspects of multiple photos into one photo by removing, swapping, or adding details to the final combined photo.  This is often used for group shots when you have some people with eyes open and some with eyes closed, or to remove distracting objects from a static scene such as cars and other strangers in the background, but this can also be used for fun creative purposes as well.  As with the new \"Exposure Merge\" HDR tool, this is ideally used with identically composed photos that were all shot from a tripod or a very steady hand.  When I mentioned above that Photomatix lets me specifically define and select the original un-HDR'ed exposure of a photo for people's faces, I can simulate this function in PaintShop Pro by using this new \"Photo Blend\" tool on the saved file output after using the \"Exposure Merge\" tool, but this workflow is very cumbersome and tedious.\n\n The new \"Selective Focus\" tool is pretty fun to work with, letting you simulate the effect of tilt-shift lenses (e.g. Lensbaby) by selectively blurring areas.  This is also somewhat similar to simulating a shallow depth of field when using a large aperture setting on a camera lens to get a blurry bokeh background surrounding your main subject of focus.\n\n Although adding a vignette effect was present in previous PaintShop Pro versions, this has now been expanded into a separate tool with more flexible options.\n\n A new \"Fill Light\" filter lets your brighten shadow areas in photos and a separate \"Clarity\" filter lets you sharpen or soften subtle details in a photo.  These two filters, presented together as a single tool, can be used, for example, on a portrait to brighten a dark shadowed region of the face while selectively softening the wrinkles on the person's face for portraits shot in the harsh bright glare of mid-day sun.\n\n Although Corel hopes that users perform RAW conversion using their new AfterShot Pro software (which was formerly \"Bibble Pro\" before Corel acquired Bibble Labs), PaintShop Pro still includes its \"Camera RAW Lab\" for RAW conversion, and this X4 version adds new highlight recovery options to recover details in overexposed regions of a photo.\n\n More than 20 tools have been upgraded to support 16-bit images.\n\n There is built-in one-click photo sharing that lets you upload photos to either Facebook or Flickr, or send via email.\n\n Ergonomics, Usability & Ease of Use:  Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating\n\n The user interface now features three separate, yet integrated, workflow interfaces, designated by tabs across the top of the program window: \"Manage\", \"Adjust\", \"Edit\".  The \"Photo Organizer\" in previous versions is now replaced by an \"Organizer\" palette which is available from all three workflow tabs.\n\n The \"Manage\" tab is where you browse, review, and rate images, edit metadata, and create collections of photos.  This workspace lets you review and organize your photo files.  Using the navigation palette, you can select an entire photo folder on your computer, narrow the selection according to one or more tags that you have assigned to photos, or narrow the selection according to the ratings that you have assigned to photos.  The palette also shows basic EXIF information about a photo.\n\n The \"Adjust\" tab is where you can make photo adjustments using a subset of the most common tools such as sharpening, color balance, brightness/contrast, fill light, clarity, tone mapping, noise removal, cropping, straightening, red-eye removal, or using its various built-in touch-up tools.  Edits can also be applied to batches of files.  This tab only offers a portion of the tools that are all available from the \"Edit\" tab.  Its interface is cleaner and far less busy than the \"Edit\" tab, and because of its simpler layout, it makes an ideal interface for beginning users who are just starting to learn the software.\n\n The \"Edit\" tab includes all of the entire sets of tools for photo editing, drawing, painting, and graphic design work.  By contrast, the \"Adjust\" tab offers only a subset of what can be accessed from the \"Edit\" tab.  I think of the \"Adjust\" tab as being designed for novice newbies and beginning-intermediate levels of users, who often are not exactly sure what is wrong with their photo and how specifically to correct/adjust it, and the \"Edit\" tab is designed for advanced power users like me who want to have direct access to all the tools.  If you are just starting out with graphics software, I recommend that you begin your photo editing from the \"Adjust\" tab, and then later as you become more proficient with the software, you can ignore this tab and always proceed directly to the \"Edit\" tab.  The \"Adjust\" tab is much cleaner with its presentation of tools grouped into a handful of categories on the left side of the user interface and four menu options along the top, whereas the \"Edit\" tab lets you access every possible tool in its comprehensive tool chest and eleven menu options along the top.  Overall, I think that this three-tab design strikes a happy balance that addresses the needs of both new users and power users.\n\n While the \"Manage\" and \"Adjust\" tabs are more simpler, clean, and organized in their user interface layouts, the \"Edit\" tab feels very busy and crowded, and it can be hard to find tools, especially when you are initially familiarizing yourself with all of the software's dozens of tools.  And to add to this ergonomics and usability issue, the main menu on the \"Edit\" tab divides the tools into two menu options: 'Adjust' and 'Effects'.  The \"Adjust\" tab includes a subset of options that are listed under the 'Adjust' menu option on the \"Edit\" tab.  One ambiguous example is that under the 'Adjust' main menu option of the \"Edit\" tab, there is a 'Brightness and Contrast' option that then opens up a submenu containing the new 'Fill Light/Clarity' tool.  But the 'Adjust' menu also lists a similar tool called 'Fill Flash'.  Both the 'Fill Light/Clarity' and 'Fill Flash' tools have a similar function, but neither the printed User Manual nor the online \"Help Topics\" documentation explain what the differences between both tools are.  At a minimum, the 'Fill Flash' tool also needs to be moved into the submenu below the 'Brightness and Contrast' option.  Ideally, both 'Fill Flash', which has 'Strength' and 'Saturation' slider settings, and 'Fill Light/Clarity', which has 'Fill Light' and 'Clarity' slider settings, should be combined into a single tool window containing three or four sliders, instead of confusing users as to which of these two tools to use.\n\n The software links to a variety of searchable online help and built-in tutorials.  As with some of their other recent software releases, Corel has the help documentation in this PaintShop Pro X4 set up so that clicking on the 'Help' option from the menu and then selecting 'Help Topics' starts up your browser and takes you to Corel's Web site where all of the help topics are accessible online and can also be searched.  I really wished that Corel gave the user the option, during the initial software CD installation process, to either install the entire help documentation locally on the computer or to link the software to Corel's online Web site.  After all, being dependent upon online access in order to access help information can be problematic if the user needs to search the 'Help Topics' from a place where there is no Internet access.  On September 2011, Corel released a 125-MB 'Corel_PSPX4_LocalHelp.exe' patch that does install all of the help files locally on my computer, but after I installed this patch, clicking the 'Help Topics' still always brings up my browser and opens up a new tab to display Corel's online help content.  And there does not seem to be a way to configure PaintShop Pro X4 to default to offline mode and use the locally-installed help files even when no Internet connection is available.  But you can still manually access the locally-installed help files by directly pointing your browser at the directory path where all of the help files are installed.  The main Web page for the help files is located in the directory path below:\n\n32-bit C:\\Program Files\\Corel\\Corel PaintShop Pro X4\\Languages\\EN\\Help\\wwhelp\\wwhimpl\\js\\html\\wwhelp.htm\n64-bit: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Corel\\Corel PaintShop Pro X4\\Languages\\EN\\Help\\wwhelp\\wwhimpl\\js\\html\\wwhelp.htm\n\nIf, like me, your PaintShop pro install also constantly redirects you to Corel's Web site, you can point your Web browser to this location to access the locally-installed help files.  This locally-installed help documentation page, complete with a search function, works well using either Internet Explorer or Safari browsers, but Firefox just displays a blank two-framed page.\n\n Performance, Stability, Reliability:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating\n\n Compared to previous versions of PaintShop Pro, this X4 version has pretty good stability.  During almost one year of weekly usage before writing this review, I have had the software crash or hang about 6 times total, and this includes running the software on an old underpowered Windows Vista laptop and a tiny Windows 7 Dell Mini 10 netbook.  Corel has obviously worked on adding stability with this version, along with GPU optimizations.\n\n Speed has been noticeably improved, the performance is considerably faster than previous versions, start-up time to launch the program for the first time has been improved, and these improvements are especially apparent when running PaintShop Pro X4 on an older slower computer.  When used on my 5-year old Windows Vista laptop with 2GB memory, applying most effects happens in real-time, and for some operations such as adjusting sharpening parameters on 100-MB TIFF image files, the pop-up preview window will still display a progress meter, but these progress meters only last for a few seconds on this older laptop of mine.\n\n This new X4 version of PaintShop Pro now requires only 1GB of disk space.  The previous PaintShop Pro X3 version required 3GB of disk space, which tells me that prior to X4, PaintShop Pro had become very bloated and disorganized.  So this redesign both increased performance and reduced the disk space required.  By comparison, Adobe's latest Photoshop Elements 10 requires a whopping 3GB to 4GB of disk space, even though it has less features and effects than PaintShop Pro X4.\n\n Competitive Pricing & Value:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating\n\n At the time of this review's writing, PaintShop Pro X4 Ultimate is being discounted on Amazon at a price less than $50, and its price is less than Amazon's price for Photoshop Elements 10, even though PSPX4 is a more capable and better program!\n\n Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:\n\nFor overall bang-for-the-buck combination of very affordable value and feature-packed power in a commercial photo-editing software package, this PaintShop Pro X4 currently reigns supreme, beating out Adobe Photoshop Elements 10 and all other photo-editing software that I can think of.  If you want something even less expensive, look into a freeware graphics software called \"GIMP\" which offers a ton of graphics editing power for free.  And if you have no experience with graphics software or if you do not want to spend time learning its complexities, look into the free and easy-to-use software called \"Paint. NET\".\n\nDespite the significant performance improvements in version X4 (I think that it is roughly 50% to 100% faster than X3 and also more stable), it still does have its slow areas of laggardly performance.  In particular, this is not a good software for processing RAW files, both due to its slow RAW converter and due to its limited RAW compatibility.  But now that Corel has repackaged Bibble Lab's \"Bibble Pro\" as their \"AfterShot Pro\" software, you should consider \"AfterShot Pro\" for your RAW file processing; Bibble had one of the fastest RAW converters and Corel acquired Bibble Labs to compete with Adobe's Lightroom.\n\nIf you want the deluxe photo management and editing solution, deluxe in capability, cost, and complexity, using Adobe's Lightroom and Photoshop CS are the way to go.  Otherwise, this PaintShop Pro X4 is an excellent \"Photoshop for the masses\" alternative.  If you primarily shoot in RAW, adding Corel's new AfterShot Pro allows for great RAW handling followed by photo editing in PaintShop Pro X4.  And if Corel's HDR feature in PaintShop Pro X4 has whetted your appetite for HDR processing, you should seriously consider getting Photomatix Pro (currently at version 4) since its capabilities exceed anything that Corel or Adobe has to offer.\n\nIf you are using a previous version of PaintShop Pro, is this PaintShop Pro X4 worth the upgrade?\n\nMost definitely!  As previously mentioned, if version X4's one main new feature was the addition of HDR tools, I would say to just keep your existing X3 version and purchase Photomatix for your HDR needs since Photomatix is far better at HDR processing than what Corel, or Adobe, has as their HDR offering.  But there are at least 75 new and enhanced features with version X4, and if you can purchase it aggressively discounted on Amazon, this is a must-buy upgrade.  Even if you ignore all of its new features and enhancements, just the fact that X4 runs a lot faster and more stable than X3 is a compelling enough reason to upgrade.\n\nIf you are just starting out with photo-editing, should you buy this PaintShop Pro X4 or&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Adobe-Photoshop-Elements-10/dp/B005MMMT6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Adobe Photoshop Elements 10</a>?\n\nI feel that PaintShop Pro X4 is a far more capable and feature-rich program than Adobe Photoshop Elements 10.  PSPX4 is more like the full-blown Photoshop CS version than APE10.  APE10 includes more built-in layer styles that PSPX4 does not have, although if you are just starting out, you will not miss this.  Once you become proficient in PSPX4, you can create your own styles and record them as scripts to repeatedly reuse.  Photoshop Elements has a much larger user base than PaintShop Pro, and there are numerous sites to download brushes and textures from, but it is easy to convert Photoshop brushes to use in PSP, so that is not really a problem.  APE10 has more adjustment brushes than PSPX4 when it comes to brushing on effects like dodge, burn, and saturation.  But PSPX4 has more artistic tools than APE10, useful for painting, drawing, scrapbooking, and graphic design, and PSPX4 is more useful and flexible for manipulating images other than photos than APE10.  PSPX4 requires less than half the disk space to install than APE10, and at the time of this review's writing, Amazon has it priced lower than APE10, even though PSPX4 is far more packed with features.  But... if you think that you will eventually migrate up to Photoshop CS, which is far more complex, powerful, and expensive, then starting out with APE10 will give you skills that are more transferable to Photoshop CS than becoming proficient with PSPX4.\n\nOne final note:\n\nTwo of the extras that are included in this \"Ultimate\" bundle are couple codes that allow you to download 21 photos from Fotolia and receive a $33.95 discount off a photo book that you create from the Blurb.com Web site.  However, these coupon codes have expiration dates on them, and on the package that I received, the offers are only valid through December 31 2012.  I do not know if this expiration date applies to the coupon codes of all \"Ultimate\" packages that are shipped throughout 2012 or if Corel adjusts the expiration dates for packages that are shipped out later, but that is something to consider if you are deciding to purchase this near the end of 2012.\n\nAlso, during the past 8 months, Corel has released two important service pack patch updates for this PaintShop Pro X4.  After installing PaintShop Pro on your computer, you can either download these large 235-MB executables from Corel's Web site, or from the user interface, click 'Help' and \"Check for Updates\" to download and install the service packs that way.", "summary": "Excellent, affordably-priced \"Photoshop for the non-professional-graphics masses\", with more features than Photoshop Elements 10", "unixReviewTime": 1342915200}

My interest in MapPoint was focused entirely on mapping data so I could visualize where my employees live and work. Routing information, optimizing trips, and sending data to my GPS were not the reasons I got MapPoint. I looked at the GPS connection tool and walked away confused. (Hey MicroSoft! Why not take a page from Google's book and tell us what GPS units you can actually interface with?)\n\nSo my review is focused entirely on how easy it is to use MapPoint to map lots and lots of data into it. The answer: pretty dog gone easy! I took data from an Excel file and, in less than two minutes, had push pin maps of where my employees live throughout the country. This data is easily combined with, say, health plan provider data to show gaps in medical networks, or to identify concentrations of people in rural vs. urban areas.\n\nAnother Amazon reviewer took over 3200 words in a thorough product review to say he didn't like MapPoint - especially the map displays.

Of course, when you are mapping hundreds of data elements in a tiny region, you may not be able to see all of them, but this is where MapPoint shines: you can select how you want volume data to be displayed, so that different colors denote different population samples.\n\nBut that said, how compelling is the information that MapPoint churns out of data? Of course, that depends on who is using it and for what purpose, but in my application, it produced interesting but not earth-shaking revelations. One thing that the 3200 word reviewer said that makes total sense is to download the trial version and use the heck out of it for 60 days before deciding.

But if you want to do the \"full\" installation, it took me about an hour to install all the data from the other two DVD,s which is pretty slow for a disc based install.  I've installed multi disc programs before, and they haven't taken anywhere near that amount of time.

That goes to show how much I like the software.  One of the reasons I wanted to replace version 9 was it was quite buggy.  Sometimes it would crash for no apparent reason, other times the accuracy didn't seem that great.  It also was quite a resource hog, but then again so is version 10.  However I have a pretty good computer with a quad four processor, and three gigs of RAM so it doesn't really pose a problem.  Generally when I'm not using it I shut it off anyway.\n\nI have noticed however that the accuracy and stability is a lot better than version 9. A lot of the quirkiness maybe due to the complexity of the program.  It is a full-featured program albeit with a user-friendly interface. As time goes by I will try tweaking the program a little more.\n\nI cannot comment on the included headset that comes with the software. I am still using my trusty Telex USB headset. I've had this thing for years and it works great so why change.\n\nIn conclusion all I can say is I'm happy with the software.  It is very functional, a step up from version 9, and a lifesaver for those that are typing challenged. It does require some effort on the users part, but then again so do most things that are worthwhile.  I would definitely have given it a five star rating if not due to the quirkiness.

Several months ago, I bought and used PowerDirector 12 and was impressed by how fast it authored and burned 3D Blu-rays.\n\nThis version is even faster. I have burned several 3D discs and am amazed at its speed. A short compilation video of a trio of scenes took less than three minutes. A six-minute puppet show took less than eight minutes. I am used to starting the process and then coming back hours later, hoping that everything worked. With this software, I can try multiple options and not be as concerned with time. I generally use BD-RE discs so wasting discs (\"creating coasters\") is not an issue.\n\nEditing video is similar to other programs but there is still a slight learning curve. As I learn more about this program (and I had only used PD12 for a few months so not a lot of experience overall), it appears that it will expand to meet my needs. I have downloaded some menus and templates from the Cyberlink website and appreciate the other users' contributions. I tried the EZ video option where the program will attempt to analyze the input files and select the project options. It took quite a while to process the video and the result was similar to what I would choose. Maybe I did not enable some feature but overall I did not find it worthwhile.\n\nFor 3D video, I am using a JVC Everio GS-TD1 and it works quite well. I have also tried a Fujifilm W-3 but have not been able to find the proper combination to output a usable disc. It records in 24FPS and there might be some setting I am not choosing correctly. The JVC works pretty much with defaults. 2D video is completely straightforward and I have used multiple sources successfully. All that is required is to choose the proper output path.\n\nAs far as resources, I am running this on an i7 PC under 64-bit Windows 7.

During installation you are asked to agree to the Privacy Policy of the Moovie Live service. Unfortunately the long privacy policy is shown in a very small window that only shows six lines of text at a time. You can choose to Skip instead of Accepting the policy but you won't have access to this service which brings up details about the movie you are watching. The DVD also includes free trials of two other programs from the same company and a PDF version of the user manual (in the UG/enu/ directory).\n\nWhen you run the program for the first time, you enter the product key (which you can find on the DVD sleeve) to activate the software. You are then prompted to register, but you can skip registration if you like. Then the program shows a reminder to download the latest patch from the Cyberlink website which is 90MB! The patch is like installing the program for a second time! When you visit the Upgrade option again (Setup, Upgrade button) the patch is still shown. Check the file name - to make sure you don't get stuck in an infinite loop of upgrades. This is not like Windows Update that automatically does not show already installed updates!\n\nThe program has a number of settings and customizations on both playback and the software in itself, but you cannot customize everything. The DVD playback options and adjustments are many.\n\nThe user interface itself is on the sluggish side, and switching from classic to cinema mode takes a lot longer than one would think. It's as if they are starting a separate program?\n\nThere are a few annoyances with the program: smaller options windows that come up within the application are hard to separate from the main PowerDVD window... The software starts on a latest movie splashscreen which has nothing to do with your actual DVD. This is the \"Moovie Line\" feature which you can turn off in the settings. One would think that a program named PowerDVD would prioritize the playing of DVDs but I digress... Of the silly things the movie industry does, you only get five region-code changes for BluRay playback. This is just stupid. Why does the movie industry work so hard to get their customers to hate them?... At times the user interface feels more like a website instead of an actual program, and that's not a good thing.\n\nI find 3D with current technology more of a gimmick, so I don't really care for 3D at the moment. I did not contact customer support so I can't comment on them.\n\nYou can control the program with apps on your smartphone or tablet. The PowerDVD Remote app is available for free on iTunes and the Android Market. After you have the Power DVD software running on the desktop computer, you launch the app, enter a 4-digit device code on the mobile app, and you are good to go as they link up together. The 4-digit code is under the Device tab on the Power DVD desktop software. The device code is the same for every device you connect, so you may want to write it down or memorize it, that way you can connect multiple devices faster. The app worked successfully without issue on the iPod Touch, and Google Play devices (smartphone and tablet).\n\nI actually had a iPod Touch and an Android device connected simultaneously to the PowerDVD desktop software and they both worked at the same time. I used one as a touchpad remote, and the other as a buttons remote. (you don't need two devices though, you can easily switch between touchpad control and buttons control within the same PowerDVD Remote app).\n\nOverall, I am happy with the DVD playback of this software and its many options. Having said that, I am not a videophile, so I have no strong preferences on the finer things of video adjustments and customizations. There are plenty of annoyances and irritations in the software surrounding its core functionality, and that may be enough of a deal killer for some people as a matter or principle or functionality. 4-stars for the actual playback but the rest of the stuff drags it down.", "summary": "Happy with DVD playback, but plenty of UI annoyances", "unixReviewTime": 1344816000}

The initial splash screen was easy to negotiate.  Each component has its own set up panel and is self explanatory.  There are buttons for  anti-spyware, anti-virus, anti-spam, and firewall settings.  Each menu is easy to negotiate and has a number of variable settings.  I didn't want to wait a long time for a full scan, so I opted for the more superficial, quick 'intelli-scan.'  The program did come up with a number of spyware issues that it quite easily deleted on command.\n\nOf note, after installing it in Bootcamp, the suite worked flawlessly in virtualization.\n\nRESOURCES:  Prior to running this suite, I was using Macafe's security suite.  In comparison, Macafe was a real resource hog, slowed down the machine, and asked too many questions.  What with Vista constantly asking for permissions, things were getting a little ridiculous.  The firewall seems to ask appropriate questions and allowed code to run after a single query.  Overall, I had a much better experience with this than Macafe and Trend before this.  Caveat emptor, I am no firewall maven so the efficacy of the firewall could be an issue here.  But assuming that the program performs well it works smoothly.  The experience here is a lot like running Commodo or Zone Alarm.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nOverall, it works smoothly and as advertised.  There is nothing new, innovative, or sensational about it but, after all, it is a security suite. For me, I felt that unlike my past experiences, this suite ran without slowing my computer down to a crawl.  It also was less invasive than other firewall options.  I also liked its simple, no-frills user interface.\n\nPC tools makes Spyware Doctor which is an award winning spyware remover and is part of the suite.  If the antivirus, firewall, and anti-spam features are as efficacious, this would be a great addition to any PC.  And for the price, it's a bargain at that.", "summary": "A Reasonable Security Suite for Windows", "unixReviewTime": 1230854400}

Johnson", "reviewText": "I have been using some form of Microsoft office since I have been in Middle School.  While I really enjoyed what it had to offer at first, at some point it started to get annoying, mainly because Microsoft would assume you want something some way when you really don't.  It then turned into constantly undoing what Microsoft assumed that I wanted.  A perfect example is numbered lists; I would type a number, then Microsoft in their infinite wisdom would assume I wanted to create a numbered list and simply pressing the return key would automatically enter the next number.  Sometimes I wanted it like this and sometimes I didn't, but when I didn't it became frustrating to constantly undo things.  Another thing I absolutely hate is the automatic double spacing when working with Word.  Sure there is a way to turn it off, but when I need to type up a quick document I don't always remember to do so.\n\nI have heard all the great things about Word Perfect, but since the cost wasn't worth it for me to pay to not deal with the annoyances of Microsoft.  However given the opportunity to try this out without any cost to me, I jumped on the chance.\n\nFirst off unlike Word, Word Perfect does NOT assume anything other than auto capitalizing when you type \"i\".  Other than that, no automatic lists, no automatic double spacing.  It simply gets out of the way and lets you work.  There is no need to worry about having to stop in the middle of typing to undo something you didn't want done.  That alone is just about enough for me to abandon MS Office altogether.\n\nIn terms of the other software in this suite, it works just like Excel (Quatrro), and PowerPoint (Presentations).  It also comes with other software, but I don't think I will be using them at all.  The main applications I will be using are the Word Perfect and Presentations.\n\nIn addition this software suite can open all Microsoft files including those the the \"x\" on the end of the extension.  So it doesn't matter if I have a doc or a docx file, this suite can open them.  One thing to keep in mind about Quattro; while it opens xls, and xlsx files, the way to enter formulas it a bit different from the way you enter them in excel.  Instead of an \"=\" to reference cells or to enter a formula, you use the \"@\" sign instead.  It shouldn't be too hard to figure out because this change is automatically taken care of when you open the Microsoft files.\n\nI really like using this Word Perfect Suite, but after using Office for over 20 years, it will take some time for me to get used to the new interface and layout, but one thing is for certain, I certainly enjoy not having to waste my time undoing things Microsoft automatically does when I'm just trying to type a document.", "summary": "Everything Office has to offer with out the annoyances.", "unixReviewTime": 1467590400}

I'm unaware of the history/reason my software, which was released just a few months ago, is already replaced -- too many errors? recall? Not sure.\n\nAnyway ... this is a decent piece of software, not great. I agree with a lot of the complaints on the Amazon reviews - no product support, virus protection lacks (lots of false positives), and reports are not terribly useful. There are also some problems registering the product - they *really* want you to buy a new box every time, for every computer, which always causes problems.\n\nMy big problem with Kaspersky is a hint of greed behind the product line -- anybody who puts excessive protections on their software, at the expense of consumer convenience, has profit (not functionality or customer satisfaction) as their #1 goal. This hunch is reinforced by their lack of support - after you buy it, they seem not to care if it works for you.\n\nBut my BIGGEST problem with this, is that anti-virus protection should be free. If Kaspersky really believes in investing energy into this product, they should make it free to consumers and charge for upgrades/advances applications (such as network and business accounts). The fact is, this is already the business model for the top rated antivirus softwares.\n\nSo here's my recommendation: Get a free antivirus. The best one right now, according to reviews of the experts, is Avast. I've never had problems with Avast (except that it wants to update too often, but it only takes a few seconds). I used to run AVG, and loved it, but the new version is too clunky, lots of crashes.\n\n*Everybody* should be running a hosts file, which Kaspersky completely ignores. The best currently is \"hostsman\" (and yes, it's free too).\n\nAnd for firewall, the most recent IT studies say that the Windows XP or Vista firewall works as well as any other. It's free, and chances are you already have it. If you're running Me, 2000, or earlier, try ZoneEdit (also free).\n\nIf you're running Vista, you may want to try some of their built-in safeguards. I tried Vista for a while, and went back to XP (too clunky). But if you're on Vista, it's got some pretty decent safeguards already, and may not work well with 3rd party software.\n\nMy bottom line is, the computer is a tool which I want to *work* when I turn it on, not spend time or energy cleaning up viruses or other crap, and I should have to spend a fortune protecting it. I haven't had a problem in 4 years (and the last trojan was because my brother-in-law disabled the hosts protection on my laptop to download a game).

I used it in the early 1990s and learned enough about it that when version 6 was released I was contracted to write half a book on the DOS version and half a book on the Windows version. I remember that the program was so buggy that within a week they sent me 6.0a, which still didn't clear up all the faults.\n\nThis was the beginning of the end for WordPerfect as the leader of the PC word processor market. Microsoft had released Word when Windows 3 first appeared, and by the time WordPerfect had released a Windows program, Word for Windows was already on its second version.\n\nWordPerfect's late arrival to Windows applications was because the company believed that Windows would not be as popular as it turned out to be. This was a belief common in the industry. Also, Microsoft established Word by introducing Microsoft Office and offered the suite of these programs at very low prices to people who installed Windows on their machines.\n\nIt's been 20 years since this happened and WordPerfect has never regained its popularity. But lots of WordPerfect users stayed loyal to the company, and today, owned by Corel, it continues. Over the years WordPerfect has improved and with the addition of the Quattro Pro spreadsheet program and WordPerfect's presentation software, it can offer a great deal of what Microsoft office brings.\n\nSome years ago Microsoft released a partial version of Office for students. Because of the popularity of Word the product went on general sale for noncommercial uses. This is the market that WordPerfect aims at, but with one important difference - a very low price. It brings the Office suite to anyone who can afford under $100.\n\nYes, you don't get the Microsoft suite but you do get a set of programs that will open and save documents in Microsoft's own format. In many ways the programs are very similar, so if you have some experience with Microsoft's suite you should have little trouble transferring to the WordPerfect product.\n\nThere are some features in WordPerfect that were groundbreaking 20 years ago. The most well-known of these is the Reveal Codes feature. Rather like HTML text has special codes which control the formatting of the following text. All word processors have this method of controlling formatting, but most hide this from you and presume you will notice the difference between, say, normal and italic text.\n\nThis Reveal Codes feature was started in the DOS days, when you couldn't see how the text would be formatted. When Windows word processors let you see exactly what you would get, this became less important, and by now I think we're all able to see the formatting rather than checking the code.\n\nSimilar features are found in the other programs in the suite. In many cases they can be invaluable to certain kinds of users especially those that have been using WordPerfect Office for a while. Although I haven't used WordPerfect I found little difficulty in using it and I would suggest that if you don't worry about knowing how to use another word processor you would find it helpful.\n\nEven though WordPerfect Office costs so little, it allows you to install it on up to three computers. That means that you get a complete installation for little more than $20, which compares well to the individual pricing of these applications in the early 1990s, when just one would cost you close to $500.\n\nSo is this right for you? If you're hoping to get employment you'll probably be better off by buying Microsoft Office Home and Student so that the transition to a work environment will be a lot smoother, because they'll almost certainly be using Microsoft Word. But if you are not worried about this degree of compatibility then by all means pay half the price of Microsoft Office and get the WordPerfect Suite.\n\nYou'll get the power of three professional-level applications along with a bunch of fonts and other programs.

Corel is a good program and fairly simple to learn and I've never had any trouble with any of their products. I just love how you can take an old torn up picture and make it look great. I do a lot of genealogy and make up family history books for people and  this program has helped me tremendously.

As a bonus, the video illustrates what you get using Roxio's 'Record Your Screen\" feature. I find it to be a very useful capability because it captures anything that's on your primary or secondary monitor, both video and sound and you can see the quality for yourself if you expand the attached video to 'full screen'. Just for fun, toward the end I am playing a previous screen recording session within the main recording.\n\n________________________________________________________\n\nRoxio was very much 'love at first sight' to me, back in the early 2000's. Even then, it managed to consolidate a number of 'media' functions into one package and it was great for as long as one's expectations were for decent, basic capabilities. Then, as the company was bought and sold, subsequent versions turned increasingly bloated, slow and bug-infested and were backed by unacceptable customer support. The last 2-3 installment were bad to the point that they wouldn't even install on my Windows 7 computers and barely worked on one of my kid's Windows 8 and so-called customer service was unable to do anything about it. I did review them at Amazon and they got well-deserved 1-star ratings.\n\nWell... here's the good news, the NXT 4 works, in the sense that it actually installed without a glitch on my Windows 7, the interface is super-clean, well integrated and efficient and everything I've tried so far works exactly as expected.\n\nRoxio NXT is a Jack-of-all-trades by design so anyone who expects Photoshop-like sophistication when editing photos is going to be disappointed. However, whatever I tried so far worked well and did for me what I expected. I didn't try 'everything' because, as the attached video shows, there's a lot in NXT but the features that interested me the most are just great. So let me give you a couple of examples.\n\n\"Capture Audio from Sound Card\", for example, would let me play some music on my computer and it's intelligent enough to determine when the song ends, then check the recording against some giant database and, if recognized, it will properly file it under the correct album, artist and song title. I works near 100% of the time for as long as you have some decent source for your music, like a music service. And, if your service has commercials, it's okay because you can set it to ignore anything that's shorter than, let's say, 35 seconds. There are many options, including 'quality' and the audio file format, even a setting to 'not record' a song if it already exists in your library. To make it short, this feature alone would make this a worthy purchase for me.\n\n\"Record Your Screen\" is what I used for the attached video. It takes everything you have on your screen and whatever sound your computer 'hears' and it dumps it all into a WMV file. Please watch the video to get an idea of 'everything' that Roxio can do. I begin the recording by simply browsing through its features. The second half were, among other things, I recorded me playing a recording of my recording my screen may not be as interesting. Note that I am using the Windows Media Player rather than Roxio's own Nero to play this because, as I noted before, Roxio's NXT 4 has 'a lot' but I do prefer other apps to perform certain specific activities and Nero's media player is far from may player favorites.\n\nWithout going any more in-depth, I would say that this version of Roxio's NXT is worth its price, even considering the reasonable likelihood of dismal customer support for which Corel, the owner of Roxio is famous. I suspect that there are other apps that can capture and properly file music. In fact I did try one or two but none, as far as I know, is as efficient and elegant as Roxio's. Same for screen capture. It's totally agnostic of 'what' it is on the screen and that makes it flexible and efficient. I also like its ability to quickly autofix large numbers (as in hundreds or thousands) of photos at once. And, since the NXT actually installed on my computer, I am happy with it and I will rate it a 4 stars, one star being deducted for Corel's terrible customer support of which I was a victim in the past.\n\nMy advice would be: just forget who makes this. I can't say much about the \"Data Copy\" section because I don't need Roxio for it so see other reviews discussing it but the Music, Video and Photo sections should make NXT a worthy app.", "summary": "On Path to Decent?", "unixReviewTime": 1455753600}

I am a fairly competent user of Microsoft Office products, having used previous versions including 2007, 2003 and 2000.\nI will review this in terms of changes that I have become aware of, and the overall quality of the product.\nWord 2010\n1. Ease of Setup:  Unlike the bad old days of putting programs on the hard drive, this program came on a single DVD disk.  As I had a previous version of Word, I was asked if I wanted to upgrade the program - which I did.  It took about 10 minutes for the process to be completed. Overall this was very fast.\n2. Program:  if you are used to Word 2003 or earlier, the user interface is quite different.  More choices appear as tabs, rather than the older style.  This certainly takes some getting used to as you will have to locate where a certain tool might be located.\n3. Visual: I believe that the aesthetic is quite nice.  The look overall of the program, once you become more familiar with the layout, is actually more simple and elegant.  It does take some adjustment from previous versions like Word 2003, but I now find this version much easier to use.  I also believe it is more intuitive for the user.\nOther programs:\nThe Office Professional Suite adds Excel, Outlook, Publisher, Access and Power Point in addition to Word.\nFrom the visual standpoint, the same tab system that is used in Word is applied here to the other programs.\nPower Point\nPower Point is a powerful program that allows the user to put together nice slide show presentations.  Here, PowerPoint 2010 adds the tabs across the screen.  This is a huge improvement over the 2007 version as it seems that the many features of PowerPoint are more easily located.  I very much appreciate that it is far easier to set up new slides in the presentation and locate all the different features that were previously more difficult to locate.  This program is a huge improvement over previous versions and I think most users will be very happy with the new more intuitive approach.\nExcel\nAgain, this version is a significant improvement over previous versions of Excel, including the 2007 version.  Instead of previous versions which made the user locate the pull down window which may have held the required options, Excel 2010 has tabs that only require the user to go to the logical place where the desired option would be located and do the required task.\nI believe that this version of Excel is probably the easiest and most intuitive version I have ever used of this powerful program.\nOutlook\nAs above, I believe that this version of Outlook is far better and easier to deal with than previous versions I have used.  Set-up is much easier with a far more guided experience than previous versions that seemed to depend on the user know certain bits of information.  Here, the set-up program just asks for the desired e-mail address and password, and it seeks to set up the information itself.  This is a little but appreciated update, because on my previous 2003 version, set-up was so frustrating that I had to try over multiple sessions.\nOverall, I believe that this is a superior version of Outlook and I look forward to giving more updates as I go through more of this program.\n\nConclusions:\nI believe that Office 2010 is a tremendous improvement over previous versions.  If you are using Office 2003 or earlier, than I think this is a major improvement and a necessary purchase.  If you have Office 2007, then I believe that this is not such a vast improvement that you must upgrade this version.\n\nOverall, I was not initially impressed with the vast suite of programs.  Yet, on more continuous use, I believe that Microsoft has vastly improved the Office canon.  Believe me, at first you will curse and scream in agony over the choices that have been made.  Where is my favorite tool or feature that was supposedly upgraded you will as over and over.  You will certainly consider yourself to be stupid for making the purchase.  But, if you stick with these programs, you will eventually use it and believe it makes a great deal of sense and begin to become proficient with the programs.  In other words, there is a significant learning curve with these programs.  If you understand this and give it time, I believe that you will, like me, learn to appreciate what has been put into the Office suite.", "summary": "A significant learning curve, but a great improvement over previous versions.", "unixReviewTime": 1290988800}

This forced surprise upgrade fees when people were doing their taxes because of the removed forms (which where included in previous years). Fortunately Intuit ultimately relented thanks to the consumer outcry. Not only that, I'm not happy with Intuit's Congressional lobbying efforts to prevent simplification of filing your taxes (guess why?).\n\nUnfortunately so far my experience with H&R Block has been disappointing so far but hopefully that will change. If not then I'll be back to TurboTax next year.\n\n1. Upon installing the product, it recommended that I create an account at hrblock.com. Upon doing this, I quickly discovered that they prevent pasting into the password fields. I greatly despise this because it's terribly annoying and it encourages insecure (weaker) passwords because you can't paste more complex ones in (it can also cause problems for password managers). I discovered a great Chrome extension in the process though, called \"Don't f*** with paste\", but this wasted my time and made me question H&R Block's poor security choices. I want REAL security, not the illusion of it from not being able to paste my complex password into the password field. If they do this then what other poor security choices could they be making? Good security choices need to be at the forefront when dealing with people's financial information and social security numbers and this does not reflect well on that.\n\n2. ONLY ONE DAY after I bought it (the Amazon download), the price was lowered. No problem I thought, I bought it yesterday and Amazon will refund me the difference because Amazon will do the right thing. THEY DIDN'T REFUND ME and gave me some strange excuse about their \"effort to provide the most competitive prices on our digital software and video games\". In their \"effort to provide the most competitive prices\" they couldn't give me a competitive price because I bought it one day earlier? Really? It doesn't really seem like they're serious about that \"effort\". Anyway, the end result is that I'm disappointed in both H&R Block and Amazon. Usually Amazon impresses but not this time... so beware about this issue and don't expect any refunds should the price drop from when you bought it, even if you bought it just 1 day before.... or at least buy it somewhere else where they give you price protection instead of excuses (if you care about this). UPDATE: In their email response declining a price match I answered 'No' to their 'Did I solve your problem' question and they said 'Please give us another chance to help you.' so I emailed them and gave them another chance. This time they gave me some promo credit for 'Amazon Digital Software and Video Games Download'. I would have preferred a refund or credit good toward any purchase but at least it's something. I'm still disappointed due to the hassle and that the credit is pretty worthless because I buy so little digital software and video games from Amazon, and this experience just makes me want to never buy downloaded software items again from Amazon.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, I can say that I did not (yet) run into any issues downloading the product and installing it on Windows 10. Coming from TurboTax the interface doesn't look as polished but I am more concerned about function than looks. Importing from my 2014 TurboTax file seems to have worked well. No errors or bugs found (so far anyway).\n\nI plan to update my review as warranted.\n\n*** UPDATE 2016-04-05 ***\n\nWell, I'm filing my mother's taxes first because they are easier. I did the update. That seems to have worked well. However, I get to the end and want to print a the return for filing (I'm actually going to e-file but I want to see what the printed return is). So what does H&R Block give me when I print an official return for filing? Answer: A bunch of pages that say \"Not For Filing\". Not good.

Right now, though, it is the faster and most fabulous Windows OS I have ever used, except it doesn't have Word for free like the Vista on my Dell laptop.\n\nOkay, I'm reviewing the free download from Microsoft, which anyone can get for any device with home versions of Windows 7 or 8 on it.  Months ago, I reserved Windows 10 for my Toshiba Satellite laptop with Windows 7.  After reserving it, my Toshiba started having problems, especially on start up.  It could take me sometimes 10 minutes to get online! Firefox froze constantly, Chrome was only slightly better, and IE would hardly ever work at all.  I suspected the problems were due to Windows 10 either being downloaded or tested out on my laptop in the background. At one point, I even stopped the automatic Windows Updates so I could see what was being installed.  Unfortunately, I forgot I stopped automatically updating and when I went to Windows Updates this week, saw that I had countless critical updates.  I also had only one choice to choose--Install Windows 10.  They didn't even send me a notice it was my time to do so, after I had been waiting for the notice for months.\n\nWell, I hit the install button, left my laptop plugged in and went about my day.  When I came home and checked the download in the late afternoon, it said it had failed.  The error code suggested the laptop lost connection to the internet.  Thus, I started again and the download amount immediately went to 49% . . . but then it went down to 0%.  I then decided to try to do individual installation of all the critical updates for Windows 7, pushed cancel, and discovered I no longer could view the individual updates.  My only choice was to choose installing Windows 10 again, which I did, and my download amount immediately became 90%.  It then quickly went to 100%, the installation started and finished in no time, and I, at long last, had Windows 10.\n\nIt started off with some settings questions that seemed like nothing but spying to me, so I chose \"off\" for all of them.

Every September when they were updating the suite I would buy the next one. Typically for Norton, in the first months after the release, the software would suck because they were releasing it before it was ready.\n\nThrough the years, the software got worse and I started looking for alternatives and for a while I went with different packages.\nAs of this year I heard only good thing about the Norton Suites and I decided to try Norton 360. I also use Norton Internet Security which I like better. Norton 360 is a well rounded application suite which has extra features in addition to the Internet Security programs (firewall, antivirus, identity protection, etc). The most important additions are the Backup and the PC optimization. In my case I don't use the Backup part because it does not suit my needs but I can see that some people will use it and like it. Symantec offers the options of backing up online (2GB of space is free, for more than that you have pay), to an external HDD or to an optical drive. On the other side, I find the PC Optimization application almost useless. I did not see any difference in performance and that stopped me also from buying Norton System Works for my computers without 360 (System works includes the optimization tool).\n\nOverall since the previous versions, they improved one important aspect of all the suites: SPEED! Before, installing Norton programs on your machine was like condemning the PC to a slow death, not you can barely notice the software is there.\nAnother complain I have is regarding the Antivirus part. At times, the antivirus is paranoid also reporting false positives. While this is not necessarily a bad thing (better safe than sorrow), it will not let you customize the action it takes. In the previous versions and on the enterprise editions (I use Symantec antivirus at work) it would allow you to change the way it behaves if it finds a threat (for ex. quarantine the file instead of deleting it). Now, the program will delete the file automatically without even asking. That is unacceptable in my book. The user should have the right to decide what to do. Norton Internet Security behaves the same way and I hate it.\n\nOverall, it is a good suite for family PC(s). If you don't need the backup, save your money and go with the Internet Security suite instead of paying more for the 360!", "summary": "Norton 360 V3 - It could be better but it works ...", "unixReviewTime": 1253232000}

This latest program loaded on a Windows 7 PC with no problems, and easily updated online when prompted by the installation software. It offers a free, three-month subscription to Ancestry.com, and makes little sense to use Family Tree Maker without Ancestry.com to support it, since Ancestrys archives can find more data on your ancestors -- birth, military and marriage records and so forth. However, the user should remember that Ancestry will want the users credit-card information and, if the user doesnt opt out or upgrade in three months, Ancestry will automatically subscribe the user to a new quarter (current price $50.85).\n\n(I find that it sometimes helps to log into your account at Ancestry.com online -- that is to say, through a browser -- and then open FTM).\n\nFTM comes with a helpful, 300-page booklet, a Companion Guide that explains FTMs features, functions and options.\n\nIve used previous versions of FTM and find this version to be a little easier to view trees and add data for individual ancestors. I still need to open the individuals file to add things like military service, occupation and so forth if the data is on paper or family memories. You can flip back and forth between the tree and the person, but Im still a little cramped by the trees showing a persons direct ancestors and descendants, and those only through one spouse visible at a time. If the person had two or three spouses, with children, its still a little difficult accessing what are separate (and separately invisible) branches.\n\nThe merge feature from Ancestry records to your FTM family tree is a very convenient way to combine info on family members, especially if Ancestry points to possible entries in public records. FTM shows this with a leaf symbol on the family members page in the family tree, and clicking on it will bring up a list of Ancestry links to marriage and other public records. This will add to existing family members information and also point out previously-unknown children, siblings, parents. This is a big improvement but the FTM buyer should figure on an investment in Ancestry.com as well.\n\nRecommend.

Well, that may be over simplified. Norton has revamped their retail security lineup with the home line simplified to pretty much Norton Security with or without backup.\n\nThis application comes with licensing for 10 devices: Windows, Mac, IOS (iPhone/iPad) and Android. This should be enough for many families but maybe not all. You do not get the same features on all devices. I have Windows and IOS so I'll share my experience with these.\n\nWindows Setup:\n\nWindows Installation was faster than with older versions of Norton and was pretty painless for me. I did have to restart my Windows 7 Pro desktop. The controls available are pretty basic and there are lots of on/off controls to customize how Norton works. What is missing in this incarnation of Norton Security is the ability to white-list specific directories or files. This caused some consternation for me, but more on that near the end.\n\nIn operation on Windows I feel Norton Security with Backup is less \"noisy\" than previous versions; I don't feel like I'm constantly being marketed to death. Unlike previous versions of the retail product I didn't perceive my PC running noticeably slower with it in operation. This is a very good thing! The initial full scan turned up a couple of minor items missed by my previous antivirus, but none of these were active viruses. Instead they were inactive left over pieces of already removed viruses.\n\nApplication Compatibility Problems:\n\nApplication Compatibility Problems:\nI use VirtualBox to run a virtual machine on this PC. When I installed Norton Security Virtualbox was unable to start my virtual machine instance. Virtual box seems to have problems with most recent Symantec antivirus products (including&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Norton-Small-Business/dp/B00JKZPTPC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Norton Small Business</a>). I was stuck until I upgraded VirtualBox to a version which is newer than the latest official release (as of Oct. 1, 2014). This virtual machine is critical to my business so I was happy to finally resolve this. This is the only application compatibility problem I've come across so far.\n\nNOTE: As of Late February Virtual Box seems to work fine again with the mainstream releases IF you disable Norton Security during installation. This might be a good practice when installing trusted applications on systems with Norton Security.\n\nBackup Use:\n\nThis is Norton Security *with* Backup. The software supports backup to the Norton cloud and to local devices. It includes 25GB of cloud storage for the 1 year term of the license. I did not use the cloud option and setup backup to a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/WD-My-Passport-Slim-2TB/dp/B00EO3031A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">WD My Passport Slim 2TB</a>. Backup completed with good speed. There is reasonable control over what gets backed up. It is a nice backup tool. I feel it's important to note that Windows 7 Pro and newer have a good built-in backup tool that is free, easy to use and will backup to a local device or network share.\n\nNorton Security with Backup provides a cloud option and is even easier than the windows Backup. Is it worth the extra cost over the non-backup version? Not for me on a Windows PC with local backup media. It could be desirable for a lot of folks, especially those wanting cloud based backup.\n\nMobile Support:\n\nI have tried the IOS app on my iPhone and it is a disappointment to me. It has a few features which do not include any virus protection:\n1) locate your phone: this placed my iPhone 4S a mile way from its actual location!!\n2) it can ring your phone: I can just dial the number\n3) it has a \"scream\" function: makes your iPhone put out an annoying siren like noise\n\nIf the \"scream\" actually sounded like a scream this app would at least have some entertainment value. If you have more devices than the 10 allowed in this product, don't waste one of these with the IOS app! The IOS support is pretty poor.\n\nI have read that Android devices have better support against malware, but I don't have an android device to try this out.\n\nConclusions:\n\nThis incarnation of Symantec's Norton line of retail/home security products is pretty good. It finds things other antiviruses on this computer did not and does not seem to slow things down. I had one application that had a problem, but nothing else. Backup is pretty decent. Mobile support for iPhone/iPad is poor. The user interface is simple, but hides away some advanced controls like white listing of applications, files or folders. It is probably a good tradeoff for most home users.\n\nBecause it's a great product for most people, but I had an application problem and the IOS app is poor I'm giving it 4 stars.", "summary": "NEXT GEN Norton, DECENT Backup, MAY Break Some Applications, VERY LIMITED IOS App", "unixReviewTime": 1413244800}

In addition to much more efficient anti-virus engines, each of them has added more functionality and loosened up their offerings to provide the option to secure your entire household with one license if you choose to purchase the 3-user version.\n\nThere is also a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/1-User/dp/B001DSNIXY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">1-User</a>&nbsp;version for those looking for limited systems, but they are so close in price that it usually makes more sense to get the 3-user version.  Keep in mind that once you install the 3-user version on one machine, the clock starts ticking.  So you have to use it for 3 users concurrently.  You cannot install it on the same machine for 3 years in a row.  Like most anti-virus products, the license includes virus definition updates for only one year.\n\nUnfortunately, there are still some shortcomings that make these programs less ideal for power users.  As time goes on, more and more home users are starting to fall into that category.\n\nOver the past year I have been testing a variety of security suites and anti-virus programs for a work-related project.  This includes multiple versions of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Norton/dp/B001E0RZ3U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Norton</a>&nbsp;for both home and business environments, McAfee,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Trend-Micro-Antivirus-Antispyware-2009/dp/B001CPJHGU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Trend Micro Antivirus + Antispyware 2009</a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Bitdefender-Internet-Security-2009/dp/B001C31OZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bitdefender Internet Security 2009</a>&nbsp;and others.  I also continue to use some of the freeware alternatives on a few of my personal machines, including AVG and Avast.  I do not want to outline or rank all the programs here.  I only want to provide a context for how I came to some of these conclusions regarding McAfee's relative strengths and weaknesses.  Some of the strengths make this a good program for hands-off home users, but more demanding users may want to look elsewhere.\n\nThe biggest improvement that McAfee has incorporated into their product is a much more efficient scanning engine that is more resource friendly than prior versions.  In terms of *online* scanning of files, this program runs faster than most alternatives.  It also uses less memory, at least for the anti-virus engine.\n\nBut in terms of system impact, there still appears to be a performance hit from using this product for certain situations.  Certain types of internet applications just seem slower.  It also adds a noticeable delay to the startup time.  I tested clean install images with updated service packs before and after installing this program.  I speculate that some of the other elements of the program, such as the anti-phishing and anti-spyware, may be using other processes in memory and slowing down performance only for applications that trigger them.\n\nIronically, it seems like those components do not work as well as the included alternatives in competing programs.  Testing these out in a lab environment, the McAfee program was one of the slowest to detect spyware and phishing risks for known vulnerabilities.  There are some additional features that can compensate for that on the enterprise version of the product, but on this one you just have to accept that it is slightly slower at detecting those things.\n\nThe \"Total Protection\" version of the product also includes a network aware component that may appeal to SMB customers.  That program is supposed to detect rogue network devices and similar risks, but I have seen poor to mixed results with it.  I suspect there is overhead in this program for those features included in Total Protection version of the product that haven't been activated here.  I can't be 100% sure, but considering how much faster the anti-virus engine runs it is one possible reason why there is still a slowdown of system performance for certain situations.\n\nOne other thing that I noticed was that the newest version of Norton Internet Security has a much more detailed application firewall.  For those that use many complex internet applications that require custom settings, that program offers more granular control for those willing to dig down into the settings.  The basics are all covered here, but it is not as easily reconfigured.  On the same token, the default setting of the program requires constant confirmation for the system to adjust security settings for your applications.  It is possible to limit these warnings, but the configuration is not set ideally out of the box.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe strengths of the program are the improved easy to use interface and faster anti-virus scanning.  This 2009 version will definitely use less system memory than prior versions, at least directly.  It seems easy to punish McAfee and Norton for their past sins, but both products have improved slightly in that regard.  But you still have to decide if you really need some of the cleaner interface and faster scanning of these products, since there are free products that will do the same job and save you the annual subscription cost.  Also make sure that you know what features are most important to you.  If you need more control of your application firewall settings, you may want to explore the alternatives.\n\nGood luck with your software purchase.\n\nEnjoy.", "summary": "McAfee Internet Security - Improved, But Know Your Needs", "unixReviewTime": 1238025600}

There's much to like in this program; however, I've installed the upgrade on two different machines (the Small Business version on a Dell Dimension 8200 desktop, and the Professional version on an IBM T40 Thinkpad); upon intallation IE6 immediately began generating run-time errors.  I've been using IE since it was first introduced and never had experienced a single run-time error; now I get them constantly.  In checking the Microsoft support sites for both Office and IE, I found I'm not alone in experiencing this phenomena.  It's extremely annoying, and the standard response from MS is: \"it's probably due to spyware\".  Well, I've been running Spybot and AdAware for over a year, and my machines report no spyware (the Thinkpad is only a week old), but the problem persists (and didn't exist until I installed this upgrade).  I can only conclude that any spyware causing these problems must be embeded in the upgrade!\nSo, beware of the potential for IE6 run-time errors if you install Office 2003.  Also, if you use Act! (or a similar program) that runs on top of Outlook, you'll find that a supposed new security feature in Outlook requires you to manually permit Act to retrieve e-mail from Outlook every time new mail arrrives.

The key words aren't, in deference to the Windows 8 fanboys, \"only option\". The real fighting words are \"that sucks.\"\nSome people do not feel that way, but then again they think every trend is a good one-and I saw some trends during my time in school that have me ready to deliver TKOs to innocent objects when I think back on them, and the same is true with Windows 8.\nAs it was with Vista, and they share important qualities. They were ever more refined implementations of a certain highly distasteful vision of computing. One that Steve Jobs did both infinitely better and equally horrid at doing simultaneously given the appropriate tools.\nFor this to work, it has to work better than s***. Which, despite a Start butt on, as opposed to what you get with Windows 7, is NOT the case. It's flat, colorless, atrocious, and despite all that I would be willing to put up with it if I could get the right PC to run it on.\nThe key is on it you spend all your time in the Metro UI and don't play music since the default Windows Metro music playing application is more limited in function than a hood ornament on a fancy vintage car-and also only venturing to the desktop when you need to change a desktop only located setting, and using free apps as much as you can.\n(If I am going to pay money for apps, Apple will get my money because they're full-featured desktop applications with their only disadvantage being they're distributed like apps.)\nI don't want 16-color display on a monitor supporting millions of colors, and that's why I compromised and went for 7. I gave up on the third-generation Core i3, gave up on integrated Bluetooth, but don't have Vista 2.0 or 2.1 related headaches either in the user interface or in the background processes carrying out intense extracurricular activities.\nInstead I have Vista 1.1, which has a halfway tolerable amount of extracurricular activities and a UI that makes Windows Vista Ultimate and Windows 8 Pro or even Enterprise look like bloated unruly pigs.\nIt's not that Windows 8 sucks, it's that the vision that caused it to come to pass sucks, and not even in theory but merely in practice.\nOddly enough, I do like Metro on an Xbox-and don't give me the crap about how Windows 8 turns your computer into an Xbox. Because you have top-flight for the era graphics hardware in a gaming console and you often have graphics that are crap when it comes to games in a PC because they're different devices. With different target markets when comparing low-end PCs to gaming consoles.\nAnd it also works well on the Windows RT Microsoft Surface (the Surface Pro has full PC power, and so that comparison falls flat, as it does with all the other permutations of laptops and desktops), but on phones, laptops, desktops, and full PC or even Atom ULCPC tablet systems Metro does not work-you want Windows 7 and Microsoft won't allow it because they want to increase the level of Vistafication and force you to accept it or push you off the Internet.\nI'm about to go off the Internet before I'll adopt Vista 2.0 in the guise of the Windows 8 family, but then again I want to confirm what I have been reading.

This was the same with the iPad 3. I want to be clear that I have no affiliation with Rosetta Stone, am not a product tester for the company, and purchased this for home use.\n\nListed below are some details about our experience, from set-up to working with the reading program. You can jump through the first few paragraphs and go directly to the section where we played the various games if you want the details about that.\n\nBefore that, I want to briefly note some first impressions and a general summary of the program itself. Am I glad that I purchased it? Yes. Do the kids want to use this and do they enjoy it? Yes, but only if I'm nearby to add extra feedback and encouragement. Does Rosetta Stone Kids Reading do what it is designed to do? Basically, yes....because I found that it helped teach the kids some basic reading skills - , all the way from \"pre-reading\" (identifying letters, shapes, colors, etc) to understanding how to spell and understand certain words, put them in proper order in a story, remember the key points of a story - both while the story is read and afterwards, etc.\n\nThose are some of the benefits. .. and they're significant...but there is some room for improvement. It would be nice if the \"Lingos\" or the little character avatars had some varied responses instead of the same basic and chirpy \"Uh-huh!\" when a child picks the correct word or shape. Also, I wouldn't use this as a \"stand alone\" program for reading but as a very useful added resource. It is excellent practice but kids will probably still need other resources to build better skills.\n\nThe Rosetta Kids Reading may be  particularly helpful for kids who learn better by listening to words read aloud (auditory skills). And of course visual learning is an inherent part of the program.\n\nSo what about the games and exercises contained in this program?\n\nRosetta Stone Reading starts with simple sorting of shapes, colors, and letters for pre-readers, and eventually works up to reinforcing such advanced skills as learning compound words, distinguishing the different meanings of words which look the same (a kid can be a child or a baby goat, a pen can be an enclosure or a writing tool , etc. ), reading simple stories, selecting specific words out of a set of mix-up letters, etc.\n\nI felt it  was vital for me to be there to assist both children as they worked - especially as they learned how to follow the general instructions, manipulate various letters and shapes, and type words on the keyboard. At that point, they could have handled many of the games alone but they remained much more interested when I was there to provide additional encouragement.\n\nWhat I didn't like: The annoying repetitive sounds and phrases made by the various avatars  (known as Lingos). The kids and I wished there was some more variety in what they said. After each game was completed successfully, the Lingos did the same dance, with some minor variations. There could have been more variety there as well.\n\nAs noted above, every time an activity was completed successfully, the same enthusiastic \"Uh-huh!\" was heard. No variation, no change of tone. This got old - quickly But on the plus side,  the instructions were easy to understand and each step was clear. And a series of gold stars flashed when the exercises were completed successfully, providing quick feedback and some extra encouragement.\n\nBecause set-up is easy and well described online, I won't go into detail about that. It is intuitive and user friendly. Profiles can be set up for as many as 4 different kids.\n\nI  can't describe every bit of the 10 levels, 50 games and 600 activities but hope that explaining some of the games we played will at least give a general sense of some parts of the program. I'm going to describe both easy and more advanced games.\n\nOne of the easiest beginner games was called Letter Match Up. At this level there are 8 activities and each one has to be completed successfully to unlock the next one. As the name implies, Letter Match Up requires kids to choose the 2 letters which are the same, selecting them out of a group of 4 letters. After the correct choice is made, the letters' names are spoken aloud by the \"avatar\".\n\nMore advanced games included Story Scramble and Sight Word Workout. In Story Scramble several sentences are shown and the child has to put them in order. In Sight Word Workout, there are a jumble of letters, with only a couple forming actual words. Children are asked to move a box over the word which is said by the Lingo avatar. Words like \"your\"  or \"does\" and similar ones are used several times in one game so that kids get a chance to practice seeing the same word more than once.\n\nSight Word Workout also asks kids to spell simple words by typing the letters on the keypad. These become more advanced as the game progresses and more difficult levels are unlocked. Kids are also asked to spell longer words. We did play around with some other games, including one which created compound words by putting two separate words together. One example: putting the word \"lip\" and \"stick\" together to create lipstick. Later on, the meaning of each word was explained.\n\nPlease feel free to ask any questions and I'll be glad to answer and fill in any possible gaps in the information I provided.", "summary": "I tested this on Mac Air and the iPad (3rd generation) Worked perfectly, solid reinforcement of reading skills", "unixReviewTime": 1415404800}

Their free antivirus has pretty good reviews, though I'd not tried it myself. If I had it to do over, I'd probably try the free version before installing this full suite to see if there were problems with any of my applications.  I had a lot of problems with Magic Jack and this program.\n\nIt installed very easily.  It did offer to install a browser toolbar - the Avira SearchFree Toolbar.  This tool bar promises that it stops companies from recording your web activities, and makes sure you get safe sites when you search.  These features are also in the free antivirus product.  I generally do not trust browser toolbars, and due to the nature of my Internet activities, I really need my browser to load a lot of windows fast and be as fast as possible. It would just be overhead.\n\nI put this on 3 different computers - the older XP, which is a 32 bit system that is fairly responsive normally when surfing or doing light activities, just slowed down to a crawl.  Furthermore, that computer runs Magic Jack - that's really about it's only purpose in life, and the updates and scans constantly turned off Magic Jack leaving me without a phone.  I've used other AV on that computer in the past and never had that problem.  After a week, one look at my event logs showed that there were tons of new errors in my operating system and a couple of system crashes during scans and during Magic Jack load on startup that were not there before this install.  I took AVIRA off and put Trend Titanium 2013 back on that PC.  Personally, I wouldn't even try this on a PC running Magic Jack.  They just don't seem to yin-yang.\n\nThe other 2 PCs that I tried this on were running Windows 7 and were 64 bit systems.  Again installation went well.  Both PCs had ample resources.  However, one is mainly used for gaming, and started having too much lag time, so it was uninstalled from that PC.  The other one, which is mainly used for light graphics, surfing, and web work, is still doing fine with it.\n\nSo, I do think there's better options out there.  This suite does have great features and would be very nice for an older parent that needs a lot of protection and that might have a fairly nice computer.  If you're maxing out your resources on your PC as it is, or doing really intensive work with one, I'd look for another vendor that has a lighter resource utilization profile.  I'd probably also try the free version first, to see if it works ok before considering a move to this full Internet Suite.\n\nI don't think any anti-virus program has installed easier though, and I like the 3 license options.

If you're looking for software that can handle a wide range of tasks, and are willing to put some time into learning how to use it, it's a very good choice.\n\nFULL REVIEW: I find I form long-term relationships with software. ;-) Personally, I don't want to invest the time in learning my way around a particular piece of software only to bump into its limitations - to find out that it doesn't perform, or is lacking important features.  So I usually narrow my options to proven software with a balance of performance and usability, but with a bias toward features and performance.  If that fits your needs, Sony Movie Studio 13 is a good option.\n\nSIMPLE VS ADVANCED:  Movie Studio does have the option to choose a Simple or Advanced interface, so it may help the transition for those looking to start by using a limited range of features, and have the ability to switch to the Advanced interface later on.  (Or not - the software is a good value even without using all the features. I know I'll never use all of them.)\n\nVERY GOOD SOUND EDITOR: SoundForge offers a nice range of features if you need to do additional editing on the sound.  You can read reviews for it at the Amazon page for&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sony-Sound-Forge-Audio-Studio-10/dp/B003L51CUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sony Sound Forge Audio Studio 10</a>.  Note that it is not a multi-track editor.\n\nBesides the video and audio editor, a lot of other features are included.  But those are the two components I use, and those alone make it worthwhile for me.\n\nTOUCH ENABLED:  It's also not a feature I use, but if you're interested in touch enabled editing, it's a new feature in Movie Studio 13, so you may want to look into reviews of that feature.\n\nCHECK YOUR HARDWARE:  Sony provides hardware requirements that are somewhat useful with respect to graphics cards (you need a reasonably good one).  I wish they'd provide better  guidance on that, and with respect to processor and RAM. As far as I can tell, they provide the hardware requirements for editing low-res video.  Sure, the software might run on that hardware, but that's not what people are buying this software to do.  I have a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/EVGA-GeForce-GTX-750/dp/B00IDG3NDY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">EVGA GeForce GTX 750</a>&nbsp;in a desktop with an i5 3450 processor (mid- to upper-level i5) and 32GB of RAM.

The installation took about an hour on my Mac Mini.  Perhaps tellingly, I couldn't tell right away that my computer was running a different operating system.  All my settings, dock, programs looked exactly the same.  Only after using it was I able to begin to see what had changed.  NOTE:  I currently have this installed on my Mac Mini only.  I want to wait several months before converting all my Macs to Snow Leopard.\n\nThe Good:\n\n-- Start up and shut down is, as promised, faster.  Likewise, Safari is much faster than even the newest update installed on Leopard.  Most other programs run faster as well.  These speed differences are noticeable, so, if you are at all impatient, you might want to upgrade for this alone.\n-- Microsoft Office 2004 AND 2008 both work as they did before the upgrade.  I use these programs frequently, and the fear that they wouldn't be compatible almost steered me away from Snow Leopard\n-- Time Machine seems to be much more stable in Snow Leopard, and this is perhaps the biggest plus of upgrading.\n-- Snow Leopard includes X-Code tools for developers.  I don't use these, so I can't comment except that they exist.\n-- Expos is a wonderful tool once put in the Dock, although not all users will need or want this access.\n-- Computers that currently run Tiger can upgrade, thus skipping an entire OS (Leopard).  If you haven't used Leopard, you'll notice a huge difference.\n-- So far, I have not had any compatibility issues with the applications I use.  Adobe Photoshop Elements requires the installation of Rosetta, one of the optional elements, but, if you don't download it initially, the computer will prompt you to install.\n-- The family pack can be installed on five computers, without having to enter long codes.  If you have two or more Macs, the price per machine is quite reasonable.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n-- At first, I couldn't install because I didn't have enough space on the hard drive for Snow Leopard because of the presence of Leopard.  I had to get rid of some old videos and unwanted photos to make room.  Once installed, I had the space available to me again.  People who have lots of media on their computers will have a tougher time than those that have less content.\n-- The difference between Leopard and Snow Leopard are small enough to make this a desirable but not necessary upgrade.  The difference is not dramatic -- not at all like the leap between Tiger and Leopard.  You'll have to weigh the cost against the benefits.\n-- The claims of \"greater stability\" are difficult to test since the original Leopard is pretty darn stable on its own.\n\nBecause Snow Leopard is not a step backward, I recommend getting it if you plan to keep your current Mac for a while since future tweaks are often dependent on running the latest operating system.  Likewise, if you have a Mac purchased just before the release of Snow Leopard, you should take advantage of the ten dollar upgrade before it disappears.  Except for those who still run Tiger,other Mac owners will not miss much in this latest OS X.\n\n-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann", "summary": "A Nice But Unnecessary Upgrade to OS X: the good and the bad", "unixReviewTime": 1252022400}

Norton has revamped their retail security lineup with the home line simplified to pretty much Norton Security with or without backup.\n\nJust ONE Please...:\nThis item has licensing for just ONE Windows, Mac, IOS (iPhone/iPad) or Android device. If you ONLY have one device this is fine, but if you have even two you are much better getting the 5 device version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Norton-Security/dp/B00MHZ6Z64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Norton Security</a>&nbsp;or 10 device&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Norton-Security-with-Backup/dp/B00MHZ71G2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Norton Security with Backup</a>&nbsp;which should be enough for many families.\n\nWhether you get the 1, 5 or 10 device license version it is the same product. Depending on the device there are differing feature sets. For example, IOS devices get no antivirus. I have Windows and IOS so I'll share my experience with these.\n\nWindows Setup:\nWindows Installation was faster than with older versions of Norton and was pretty painless for me. I did have to restart my Windows 7 Pro desktop. The controls available are pretty basic and there are lots of on/off controls to customize how Norton works. What is hard to find in this incarnation of Norton Security is the ability to white-list specific directories or files. This caused some consternation for me until I finally found it deep in the settings.\n\nIn operation on Windows I feel Norton Security is less \"noisy\" than previous versions; I don't feel like I'm constantly being marketed to death. Unlike previous versions of the retail product I didn't perceive my PC running noticeably slower with it in operation. This is a very good thing! The initial full scan turned up a couple of minor items missed by my previous antivirus, but none of these were active viruses. Instead they were inactive left over pieces of already removed viruses.\n\nApplication Compatibility Problems:\nI use VirtualBox to run a virtual machine on this PC. When I installed Norton Security Virtualbox was unable to start my virtual machine instance. Virtual box seems to have problems with most recent Symantec antivirus products (including&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Norton-Small-Business/dp/B00JKZPTPC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Norton Small Business</a>). I was stuck until I upgraded VirtualBox to a version which is newer than the latest official release (as of Oct. 1, 2014). This virtual machine is critical to my business so I was happy to finally resolve this. This is the only application compatibility problem I've come across so far.\n\nNOTE: As of Late February Virtual Box seems to work fine again with the mainstream releases IF you disable Norton Security during installation.\n\nHow About Norton Security WITH Backup:\nIf you want an integrated on-line backup solution or have more than 5 devices, you might want to consider getting&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Norton-Security-with-Backup/dp/B00MHZ71G2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Norton Security with Backup</a>&nbsp;it supports 10 devices and includes 25GB of online backup space. Windows 7 Pro has a very capable backup program that works well with USB or network drives as backup media. The difference in price it might be well spent if you need online backup and/or more than 5 devices.\n\nMobile Support:\nThe IOS app is a disappointment to me. It has a few features which do not include any virus protection:\n1) locate your phone: this placed my iPhone 4 a over a mile away from its actual location!!\n2) it can ring your phone: I can just dial the number...\n3) it has a \"scream\" function: makes your iPhone put out an annoying siren like noise\n\nIf the \"scream\" actually sounded like a scream this app would at least have some entertainment value. If you have more devices than the 10 allowed in this product, don't waste one on an IOS device! The IOS support is pretty poor. I have read that Android devices have better support against malware, but I don't have an android device to try this out.\n\nConclusions:\nThis incarnation of Symantec's Norton line of retail/home security products is pretty good overall but has some issues. It finds things other antivirus solutions on my Windows 7 Pro PC did not and does not seem to slow things down for me. I had one application with a problem, but nothing else. Mobile support for iPhone/iPad is poor. The user interface is simple, but buries the advanced controls deep in the settings.\n\nOverall Norton Security should be a good tradeoff for most home users.\n\nThe ONE device license is not a bargain. These days, who has just one device?\n\nThe software itself is a great product for most people. If you have more than 1 device get the 5 device version or the 10 device version if more than 5 or you want backup too.\n\nBecause of the minor issues and relatively poor value compared to the multi-device Norton Security versions I'm giving Norton Security for 1 device just 3 stars.\n\nHope this helps someone.", "summary": "Expensive, Next Gen Norton, Catches MALWARE Others Missed, Very Limited IOS App", "unixReviewTime": 1416700800}

If you were a teenager, it was an easy and awesome way to screw around with pictures. Anyone who saw said pictures would know you used KPT, and whether or not that was \"cool\" depended on the audience.\n\nWhy is this relevant? Well, that's kind of what PhotoDirector is. When you first launch it (and for reference, I'm talking about the Mac version) it looks kind of like an early version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Adobe-Lightroom/dp/B00CH6ATMO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Adobe Lightroom</a>, but the functionality isn't anything more than what you've already got in iPhoto -- except that PhotoDirector isn't aware of anything in your iPhoto library.\n\nThe Adjustment tab gives you a very basic color and tone adjustments in manual mode, and really heavy presets that would make any photo look obviously manipulated... poorly.\n\nThe Edit tab gives you functions like \"People Beautifier\" and \"Object Removal\", which claim to be image-aware. In practice, they're all badly-automated knockoffs of Adobe's Heal Tool. (It basically guesses at a portion of a picture to duplicate, and uses it to cover what you don't want in the picture.) Even in pictures with low complexity, the tools do an awful job of hiding themselves.\n\nIf you have visions of doing anything at all with layers, you can forget about it. Despite giving the impression of Photoshop / GIMP / PaintShop Pro types of editing, PhotoDirector is intent on holding your hand through awful presets.\n\nSlideshow is... a slideshow.\n\nPrint is the only tab that seems at least marginally useful, but even that locks you in to weird presets.\n\nSo, if you want to take your cell phone pictures and go nuts with the \"Eye Blinger\" and \"Tooth Brush\" tools to make people look like Barbie dolls with strange patchy skin tones, or think that people won't notice how the \"Body Shaper\" tool has caused the background to mysteriously warp around your curves, this is all you need.\n\nOr, if you want to take pictures of that tree in your back yard, make it sepia, and then add a gigantic watermark and copyright to thwart would-be \"art\" pirates in just a couple of clicks, I suppose you could do worse.\n\nIf you care even slightly about photography or realism in photos, stay far away from this product.

I cannot draw or make anything resembling a realistic visualized image that has been converted for other people to view. This program however allowed me to create realistic paintings that did a better job than my hand otherwise would have if someone were to give me a paintbrush.\n\nI'm not saying this should take the place of paint and canvas or that it was the paintbrushes' fault. No but this program allows someone with no talent in this art form, like me, to be guided a little better to what fits me as I try to recreate anything on the screen.\n\nFor instance the multifarious functions that allow you to change which kind of stroke to use or the method of the stroke (watercolors, paintbrush, pencil) acted a portable art studio with everything at my disposal. I previously had no real knowledge of the different types of things that I could use. This program had it all in front of me (with help menus I might add) that taught me along the way as I learned to use this program.\n\nI used just a mouse (no stylus) so my precision was probably hindered a bit, although I don't think having more control would have helped me much, remember I am not a visual artist. So in essence I'm speaking for people out there that want the bare minimum of this program in that you are buying solely the program itself.\n\nGreat aspects of program:\n- Has every brush stroke I could think of, with all sizes and shapes to use in an instance\n- Has a color palette allowing you to choose any color or mix thereof to suit your need\n- Even with a mouse, I was able to create very succinct precision, surprisingly\n- Acts as an art studio and art teacher, in that if you haven't caught on to how to make paintings through conventional means this program actually acts as a guide that may be easy to learn from then other forms\n\nObviously you know that this review is not for the professional for I am just an average everyday software junkie who has no knowledge or art or drawing or programs thereof. I can say, however, that this program was smooth to install, extremely easy to use and taught me some things about drawing on a computer I was never aware of. For that matter, it allowed me to do things with a \"virtual\" paintbrush I never thought I could do. So if there is a budding or curious artist in your, I suggest this program will get you there quicker than a complete art studio would.

I installed this version 12 on a new Windows 8 All-in-one.  It installed relatively quickly and without a problem.\n\nOne of the new features in this version is Multicam Designer, which makes it easier to put together video using multiple cameras.  You can synchronize the audio with the different camera angles, and while looking at all of videos at the same time, cut between different angles as you put together the video.  Cool!  I don't have multiple video cameras, but I can imagine you would want one that can capture excellent audio (or use a separate audio recorder), and the rest of the cameras can be video-only as long as they all shoot in the same quality/framerate/size/etc.  I would like to try this out sometime -- this is a step toward more professional video production.\n\nThere is also a new Theme Designer that will help you create nice compilations of photos and videos.  Just drag and drop them into a template and it will create a finished video for you.\n\nThey also finally included an auto-crossfade feature, where if you overlay two tracks, it will allow you to insert a crossfade from one to the other.  This was a feature from Corel VideoStudio that I missed in PowerDirector.\n\nThis version utilizes the 64-bit environment of Windows 7 and 8 better than the previous version, with quicker rendering.  I have not had any crashes yet with v12, but keep your copy up to date since Cyberlink seems to like sending out new versions before all the bugs have been discovered and worked out.\n\nSo overall, I think this software is one of the best for consumer video editing -- a step up from MovieMaker and other free software, but of course not as intense as Sony Vegas Pro or Adobe Premier Pro.  With this one, you can get a quick slide show together with music, or a simple home video edited with intro and titles, all with a 'wizard' that makes it easy - then post to YouTube or create a DVD with menus all in the program.  Or you can dabble in some editing and now even multi-camera shooting if you are an enthusiast or want to take the next step into better quality video production.\n\nI have some other reviews on other consumer-grade video editors here, if you'd like some comparisons:\nCorel VideoStudio:  http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LXHYRSL0J4LG/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm\nAdobe Premier:  http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C3QPVKONCBP1/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm", "summary": "One of the best amateur video editors", "unixReviewTime": 1386288000}

But innovation as a way of creating a false impression of progress to mask a need to perpetually carve out market share is vile, and it has long driven Microsoft's business plan and service model. But two other marks of Microsoft has been its attempt corner a portion of the market, give the consumer no real alternative, and then force them to pay through the nose, meanwhile making it harder and harder to use previously purchased versions of the product. And to complete my portrait of the Microsoft that I hated to like, Microsoft had an absolutely dreadful customer service department. Not that Customer Service was inept, but merely unavailable. And turning the old department store adage on its head, not only was the customer never right, they were most likely very much wrong.\n\nAs a result, Microsoft had over time created a way of doing business that was out of touch with the needs of the customer. Indeed, I had come to dislike Microsoft so much that I stuck with my old copy of Office 2000 for years longer thatn I had any desire to. But I was not going to pay an absurd amount of money for a piece of software that they were only going to allow me to put onto one device, and that was not going to be supported by technical support.\n\nSo imagine my shock when I found myself something of a fan of their new way of doing business. Instead of being prohibitively expensive, Office 365 is reasonably priced. You pay less than $80 for a key to unlock a download on up to five devices. Or if $80 is too pricey, you can pay just under ten dollars a month for the same five-device key. And unlike in the past, when you paid a large amount of money for a single-user key to Office Lite (the Student Edition was essentially Word and Excel, while the subscription grants you the use of more Office programs, including Outlook, PowerPoint, Access, Publisher, and One Note. What was once a prohibitively expensive suite of programs suddenly became very reasonably priced (no doubt in part because pirated editions meant that instead of paying an absurd amount of money to Microsoft, people would simply go to a Torrent site and get a free copy of Office).\n\nAnd to make everything even more impressive, Microsoft's customer service is more accessible than ever. I had a particularly difficult installation due to preinstalled trial editions of Office 365 on my new computers. Microsoft worked with me at length to make sure Office 365 installed properly on all of my devices. Not just that, but when I expressed the wish to use my Hotmail e-mail address on Outlook, they escalated the problem to a higher level tech support person.\n\nNow, that doesn't mean that this is a perfect product. I have not liked the direction that Office has taken since Office 2007. And Microsoft still fails to include a crackerjack WYSIWYG HTML editor. But all in all I'm impressed with the nontechnical aspects of Office 365. And I have to admit that it is kind of fun having at least portions of Office installed on my desktop, my lap top, my smart phone, and my tablet. In a family with multiple computer owners, it should be possible for each family member to have a full version of Office installed on their computer. I'm still not a huge fan of Microsoft, but I'm delighted to see them make their products more consumer-friendly.", "summary": "A kinder, gentler Microsoft", "unixReviewTime": 1381881600}

It is much better to learn Chinese by seeing a picture of an apple and saying/hearing \"pingguo\" than it is to look at it and think \"apple\" in English and trying to translate to Chinese.  In this regard, their method is effective.\n\nWhere this program is lacking, however, is in not teaching the Chinese characters.  It sounds strange to English speakers, but it really is true that learning the characters is absolutely essential to learning to speak the language well.  (I resisted this at first too, but luckily a college professor saved me from my wrong thinking).  I would love to Rosetta add an option in the software that allows you to learn the characters as an intrinsic part of learning the language.\n\nIf you're just trying to learn to be conversant, and don't want to learn the characters, and prefer not to be tied to your computer, I find the Pimsleur CDs to be a better option.\n\nOverall- good program - but don't fall for the hype that learning Chinese is going to be easy.

I've looked at several such programs over the years, and found most of them useless - or at least not useful to me. I've also used real computer-aided design programs, and found them powerful, but with a learning curve far too steep for my infrequent use. The Chief product, on the other hand, seems flexible and capable, yet easy to learn and use, including videos, help tutorials, a Web site that includes a user community, and automatic checks for updates.\n\nMy immediate need is to replace the LandDesigner for Windows 3.1 program I've used for almost two decades because I never found anything better for keeping track of what's planted where in our yard. Sadly, our new 64 bit Windows 7 PC is unable to run Land Designer at all, though it still works on the 32 bit version of Windows 7.\n\nHowever, now that I have the Chief program, and see all it can do, I find myself wanting to map not just our yard but our entire house and deck into it, and perhaps map out a long-discussed bathroom remodeling project. This version includes pretty much anything a homeowner could want: home design, interior design, deck and landscaping design, and even such features as 3D camera views and video walk-throughs.\n\nInstallation went well, even though the 1.8 GHz Atom D525 CPU on our new&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Acer-AspireRevo-AR3700-U3002-Slim-and-Compact-Desktop-Blue/dp/B00433SP6G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Acer AspireRevo AR3700-U3002 Slim and Compact Desktop - Blue</a>&nbsp;is below the required 2.4GHz CPU speed. I was impressed that the license agreement actually allows the program to be returned within 30 days, and for it to be installed on up to 3 computers in your home. I was also impressed by the Web site, tutorials, and videos. The included manual is tiny, but a full one is on the DVD in PDF format, if needed.\n\nNow all I have to do is actually create our home and yard design. That will take longer, so I'll update this when I've done that. Meanwhile, the program has impressed me greatly, and seems well worth the cost. For those with limited needs, other versions are available at lower cost, such as a Decks & Landscaping version.

In fact this version of the software uses a really convenient system where you register on their site to activate your software.  This way you don't need to worry about losing your software key.  Some may find that intrusive but I find it useful.\n\nI think most people are familiar with the most basic function a virus/spyware scanner performs.  It looks for pre-defined viruses/spyware and makes sure that you don't download, email or install them.  McAfee has never been at the top of the list of virus detection but it isn't the worst either.\n\nI think perhaps the feature of this version that I like most is the Site Advisor feature (something not found in free scanners).  What this does is pre-scan all the webpages you are going to against a central database and lets you know if virus or spyware problems have been found on those pages.  This is particularly useful for people who are not familiar with more advanced methods for avoiding suspect websites.  However, this feature is somewhat problematic because on two of my older systems it significantly slowed Internet Explorer 7 (though it did not slow down Firefox 3 at all).\n\nAlso useful is the Easy Networking tool that is included.  This allows you to see a map of your network and to see the status of the McAfee software on each.  It does not use anything more sophisticated than a Windows Workgroup but it makes it easier to set up and use a home network to share printers and files.  However, I recommend caution setting up a network using this tool if you also have a wireless router.  It may or may not warn you about setting up strong encryption on your router to prevent people from logging on to your home network and viewing your network shares.\n\nFinally I do like the intelligent firewall.  Vista comes with a firewall but it is pretty weak.  This version of McAfee does a decent job of letting you know when bad programs are trying to connect to the internet.  It is also adjustable so you can get a lot of warnings (if you like that) or very few warnings.\n\nOverall I feel pretty good about this software.", "summary": "Comprehensive protection for internet users", "unixReviewTime": 1222300800}

The overhead is minuscule. For example, on the computer I'm using right now to type out this review, Kaspersky is currently using 250MB of memory and 0.56% CPU. That's quiet and well-behaved considering everything it's monitoring right this second, about 100 open ports and 172 services and applications.\n\nI have not needed at any time to delve into the firewall for tweaking. I get notified in a discreet manner that doesn't hijack my screen that there's been an exception and also what Kaspersky has decided to do about it. It then allows you the easy option of overriding or amending its actions. It is also easy to modify that action permanently. One of the easiest processes in an anti-malware suite I've ever worked on.\n\nI don't use the Parental Control, but looking over its settings, once again I found the straightforward manipulation on a great user interface. So, for example, once set on a particular account (after setting up a Parent Control password to lock down access), it is possible to lock-down or modify access for everything from filesystem access to web browser and Internet access.\n\nIn particular, I really like the applications module where, for the most part, Kaspersky automaticlly sets up what each particular application has access to, from the registry to the Internet/network. Of course, each of these can be changed easily. Applications are also rated on how popular--hence, how safe--they are and in what groups (Trusted or Custom, etc.) they reside. Brilliant piece of work here.\n\nPrepare to be blown away by how tight a grip on the ubiquitous Internet ads there are. Kaspersky effectively shuts down these seemingly stubborn things so that they're literally invisible, even in such applications as you may think can get around it. I have a Twitter application that shows ads in its own window that Kaspersky shut down. Peace!\n\nThere is, as usual, an anti-spam component, a wonderfully literate Network Monitor that shows everything your computer is doing, a virtual keyboard--in case you have a hardware snooper installed locally--and something called Safe Run for Websites that sandboxes a browser window so that in that session, you are effectively corralling the visited website from infecting anything on the machine. Splendid stuff.\n\nIn short, I am very pleased with how Kaspersky has designed this bit of software. I am giving it my highest possible rating and be assured, I will be buying a renewal once my current subscription of one year runs out.", "summary": "Best In Show", "unixReviewTime": 1329696000}

I used Front Page for years and have created several very elementary Dreamweaver sites for family members. I'm in the process of trying to work more professionally (cleaner, less, and better code) and more creatively (a less stilted and more unique and appealing design). This course doesn't purport to be a web design course, it assumes that you already have a basic idea for a (relatively simple) website and it's going to teach you how to implement it. Don't expect inspiration.\n\nPOSITIVE:\n* Level: absolute beginner to intermediate.\n*  It is entirely DVD-based. The booklet (106 pages including index) that comes with the DVD just provides additional random information; it is in no way connected to the content or the sequence of the course.\n* The scope of the information presented is all that is needed for basic competence in the implementation of a simple Dreamweaver CS5 website. You do become familiar with the DW interface; the workflow; best practices; web and DW terminology; and basic website structure and creation.\n* The sequence and progression is logical and sequential. There is some reiteration of basic principles as the course progresses to clarify how something previously explained applies in a new situation.\n* The interface is very well thought out. You can go backwards or forwards easily. It has constant access to a table of contents that allows you to search (by both topic and subtopics) in case you want to navigate to a completely different topic. It allows you to bookmark (with long notes-to-self) on topics of interest you may want to keep coming back to. The interface coloring and design are neutral and un-intrusive. The screen always retains focus and the surrounding options melt away.\n* The course has the secondary purpose of preparing for the Adobe Certified Expert (ACE) test. Each main section has a practice test at the end.\n* Another asset is that the video transcript is captioned under the viewing screen (optional). This is particularly helpful if you're in in a public place where you can't turn on the sound.\n* All explanations of hard-to-grasp concepts (ex: the box model) are clearly demonstrated with visual examples. As a matter of fact, this is the clearest explanation I have ever seen of the box model.\n* I did find the booklet section on Fireworks instructive, since I have never used that program in the past. In fact, the entire booklet is very instructive and useful--it's just totally unrelated to the course on DVD.\n\nNOT SO POSITIVE:\n* Coverage of other concepts, such as content placement and positioning, are a little more basic and less detailed than I would have liked. I can't recall (or locate now) any reference to floats, whereas AP divs and frames (both older concepts) are well covered.\n* The narrator has a pleasant voice and clear diction, but is somewhat monotone and unexciting.\n* There is no \"search\" function or \"index.\" This makes it impossible to look up a term or a topic that is not specifically listed in the table of contents. I would have thought that the transcript text might have been searchable, but it isn't.\n* For my learning style, I would have preferred that the booklet function as support material for the video so I could follow along with text that directly reinforces the visual demonstration (and is easier to go back to or use as reference material.)\n* The bookmarks that you create when taking the course on your laptop are saved to that computer. If you want to change to your desktop, the bookmarks, obviously, are not there. So as a \"personal index\" these bookmarks have their limits.\n\nOn the whole, I do recommend this course. I wish I had taken it earlier, because it laid down the groundwork better than an online course that I had just taken. However, I think that, for a person who is learning-as-you-go (not just learning general theory but actually trying to apply it to a real website) it is essential to have reference material on Dreamweaver CS5, some sort of guidance on design principles, and a solid HTML and CSS anthology--all in well-indexed books.\n\nVideo and online courses teach you very well how to build their sample websites, but when you are stumped on YOUR website, you need to be able to supplement the general principles they taught you with a more on-point reference.", "summary": "Competent introduction to Dreamweaver and web principles.", "unixReviewTime": 1287619200}

Like the previous one, the software firewall and NAV do a good job most of the time.

This version is much improved in this regard than the 2001 version, but it sometimes still asks you to set up access rules for an application -- as common as IE! -- repeatedly.  I don't know what's got into its \"head.\"  I discovered that, for one, Norton can't distinguish between the DOS-style filename and Windows-style long filename, so it thinks it's two separate applications.  But there are also other cases where the behavior simply cannot be explained.\nIn addition to the firewall and anti-virus utilities, NIS 2002 comes with parent control (I didn't install this) and ad-blocking.  Ad-blocking is a joke.  It worked the first day I installed it, and stopped working after that.\nThese little things exemplify the problem with many Norton products of late.  They are basically solid, but they have a lot of little annoying \"features\" -- such as not uninstalling themselves cleanly -- that really make users both love and hate them.

I had read many of the reviews and had decided I would wait until some of the bugs have [had] been worked out. So it was with some reticence that I loaded the program onto my computer Christmas day. From some of the reviews I thought it would blow my computer up. However, with some encouragement from my daughter I decided to install it. It was surprisingly easy. I did have two [to] download the patch from the MacSpeech website. But I was prompted to do so and everything went smoothly (I have a wireless Internet connection which made it easy).\n\nIt took me about 20 minutes to do the training. It went well. However, the first few times I tried to dictate it didn't go well. At first I feared it was a complete waste of money. After working with it for a while thing[s] started [to] work better until finally it seemed to work perfectly. I did do a few of the training exercises over again, just to be on the safe side. As you can see it's doing a pretty good job. Occasionally I use the recognition menu which allows you to verbally select from a list of options. This is especially good if there is a lot of background noise. I'm actually using it occasionally right now because I find it easier to dictate while I look at the screen. The manual tells you not to do that but for some reason for me it works better.

I'm a writer, and although my spelling and typing are pretty good, I've been using Dragon Naturally Speaking Premium for the PC for years. It reads back what I wrote, which helps me catch typos and repeated words that my eyes alone might miss. Over the years, it's gotten better and better.\n\nMy dyslexic husband, though, prefers to work on our Mac, and he prefers to have me handle his editing needs. After all, what's the point of being married to a writer if you can't have her check your spelling, grammar, punctuation, and general writing style?

There's no question about that. But it doesn't hold a candle to the latest version of Dragon Naturally Speaking Premium that I'm using on my PC. To be honest, part of it does seem to be, well, him. My husband just can't seem to find a voice-recognition program that understands him. I mean, I tried Dragon Dictate, and it seemed to work okay, though not great. I'd say the accuracy with a good headset was about 92%. (By comparison, I'd give Siri a 40% and DNS Premium for the PC a 98%). For him, though, the accuracy was more like 75% with Dictate and maybe 80% with DNS Premium. Maybe it's his English accent. Maybe it's that he sort of starts and stops when he speaks. Maybe it's that he doesn't speak at an even level. I don't know. So he's decided to stick with his old system, meaning me. None of us want to be replaced by computers, but when it comes to some things... It would have been nice. I could have spent more time on my own writing.\n\nSo I like Dragon Dictate for the Mac.

When I got the upgrade, I installed it & then uninstalled it soon after. Mostly because I had no security programs available & I wasn't going to purchase anything new for Vista when the word on it was so negative. Also, it was a pain to navigate & I just didn't have the time to spend with it to learn how to use it.\n\nFast forward to August: The desktop that I put together about 7 years ago is acting up & beginning to nickel & dime me to death. First a new hard drive, then a new NIC card & then a new sound card. I decided to scrap this computer & just upgrade to something newer but inexpensive.\n\nMy choice was an HP that came with Vista Home Premium installed. Like my Toshiba laptop, this HP desktop dosnt come with an official MS Vista disk but instead has a recovery disc. Actually I have to create my own disk but it amounts to the same thing. Used to be that I wouldnt have a computer unless I had an officially licensed MS disk, but that dosent matter much to me anymore. These days I just want my computer to operate properly & with the minimum of problems. Hopefully, Vista will accomplish that.\n\nNow that I have a new PC with Vista installed, I find that I actually like the Vista OS now as opposed to when I installed it on my laptop.\n\nI do tend to be taken in by the appearance of the interface as it is cooler & more intuitive. I like the imitation of some of the MAC qualities as Ive always liked the way the MAC did some things. And even though I own a MAC & its a good computer I find that overall its a pain to navigate sometimes. Maybe because Im primarily a Windows user & I cant get used to the MAC navigation. But again, the use of some MAC ideas was/is a good idea for Windows.\n\nI haven't found all the tips & tricks to Vista yet as Ive only had this new PC for a few days. But there seems to be plenty to learn...\n\nAs far as the the requirements of Vista, I knew it was going to take more to operate than my other PCs.\nSo when I purchased my new HP I made sure that I got more than the minimum to operate it smoothly as I figure Im going to have this PC for awhile & I don't want to be frustrated trying to operate a slow machine.\nI have an AMD dual core 2.4 ghz, 3 gb ram & a 500 gb HD. I also have a 160 gb Fantom drive & just purchased 3 Sabrent HD enclosures to install an 80 gb, 160 gb & a 250 gb ide HDs that I will connect to the new computer which will probably keep my 500 gb  HD fairly clean for some time.\n\nAs for my graphics, the computer came with NVidias GeForce 6150SE nforce 430 intergrated grphics & there has been no problem running anything graphic-wise. I haven't installed any games yet as Ive been too busy but Im  anxious to see how it does.\n\nAnother reason I got a new computer is so that I could record all my old albums & cassettes ( a few hundred ) to CD. For the last couple of days Ive been doing that with remarkable ease & with great results. The intergrated Realtek HD audio system works great. Ive been using Audacity 1.3 to record the albums & tapes & MS media player to record to CD. Flawless & fast operation.\n\nI did have a problem at the beginning. When I first began to setup my new PC I put something in that vista didn't like & ended up just doing a full recovery.\n\nI think it was the HP Photosmart 3180 update driver that caused the problem as Ive reinstalled everything I had installed before except that & Vista seems to be operating just fine.\nSo my point is Vista is doing ok but watch what you put in it...\n\nI think that software & hardware companies are still trying to get it right & some of the updates & drivers are just not up to snuff. Ive got several programs, Nero6 Ultra for one that I cant use & Nero won't be updating v6 to work with Vista. You have to buy v7 or forget it. I imagine many software companies are going to use the Vista excuse not to upgrade their previous software & you will have to purchase their new products in order to use them at all.\n\nOverall, I like the program & Im enjoying learning about it. Im also waiting for the first SP update. And since Bill has decided that this is the way he wants MS Windows to be, I would suggest getting used to it. I believe it won't be too long before support for XP goes the way of '95.  'Cause Bill is the man & what Bill says seems to go!", "summary": "Ive changed my opinion...", "unixReviewTime": 1186876800}

For Norton to encourage Spammers by letting them sell their products is a very bad sign.\nBut I have been using Norton Antivirus for several years, and McAfee's online ratings aren't much better, so -- I purchased this product online.  There was a lot of confusion and I ended up with a sales basket that included the product I wanted (Norton Internet Security Professional) and also the standard (non-Pro) version I didn't want.  The website also had added automatically, without asking me, the \"download warranty\" that lets you download again for up to one year ($6.99) for both products.  I zeroed out the quantities for the three things I didn't want and went to the next page, where I expected to see only what I wanted, and a chance to confirm it before making the sale final.  But no, I was charged for all four products, including the two that aren't products at all.\nThe run-around they put me through to request a refund was MONUMENTAL, and apparently the download warranties CAN'T be refunded.  I will complain to the credit card company and get my refunds, but all this run-around is another bad sign.  Is Norton in some kind of melt-down, that they have to treat customers this way?  If so, what about all that support they're promising, if they go down?\nNext issue: within a few minutes of installing the software, Norton blocked and reported an attempted access from the Internet, called \"Default Block NetBus Trojan Horse\".  Great, that's what I was hoping to prevent.  BUT: what was that all about?  How do I know who was doing it and who do I tell, in order to get somebody put in jail?

Ranzoni", "reviewText": "I'm a cheapskate when it comes to PC applications, so I've spent much of my artistic career on bundled programs. I still draw and edit in Microsoft's generic \"Paint\" program. And when I bought a camera that included a \"Limited Edition\" of Adobe Photoshop 5.0, I loaded it up eagerly--only to find the interface clunky and disorienting. I don't manipulate my digital pictures very much, because they tend to have satisfactory hue, saturation, and values from the outset, and I'm not into gimmicks like stain-glass filters.\n\nI needed something oriented more towards free-drawing, but with more intuitive photo styling for those rare occasions. So naturally I checked out Corel's latest  budget art program, Painter Essentials 4.\n\nRight off the bat, PE4 is light years ahead of Vista's Paint program, and noticeably superior to my old Adobe program. Granted, it lacks some photo-specific options, like red-eye reduction and other assorted filters. The layer system is also a bit more primitive. But it can do everything else and then some. PE4 is more stable and intuitive than PS 5.0 LE, with big friendly icons and tool tips.\n\nPE4 is chiefly an editor. For example, graphic novelists or cartoonists can use it to digitally fill color. However, the toolset supports scratch artwork. To that end, it alternates between two tabulated interfaces: \"Photo Painting\" and \"Drawing & Painting\", which can be selected at will from the canvas. All tools are available for either mode.\n\nThese include a text box for labeling pics, and a number of shader wizards and style presets to transform photos into paintings or line drawings. Of note is the auto-painter, which accepts a number of presets for Edge, Color, Paper, and Brush types. It does require practice and discretion to make anything look good, as it is easy to overwhelm a picture with garbage. And yes,  artists can manually touch-up or alter images without any reliance on auto-painting. Finally, the user can load and save a variety of file formats beyond the default Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF), including TIFF, JPEG, bitmaps, Macintosh PICT, and Photoshop PSD. The program also seems to automatically generate backup files in RIFF.\n\nThe biggest leg over my old Photoshop, however, are the brushes. PE4 includes 95 different brushes, tips, and blenders called Art Tips, loaded into a tab labeled the Brush Box. Art Tips divide into eight catagories:\n\nThick Paint\nThin paint\nWatercolor\nPencils & Pens\nDry Media\nBlenders\nEffects\nPhoto\n\nThese implements are all presets; users cannot customize their own brush shape or paint consistency. However, they may vary the brush-size from a pin-point to a dinner plate, adjust the opacity, and alternate between free-hand and straight line strokes.\n\nI don't own a stylus and pad, so I can't review that section, but I can testify to mouse-based art. Right-clicking the cursor brings up a context-sensitive menu, though the options are limited to different brush types within the category, plus incremental size changing. The brushes are self-explanatory and they work the canvas as I expect. Strokes have built-in anti-aliasing and a decent resolution; they still look ragged and a touch pixilated on my high-def LCD monitor, but better than my old programs. Out of the box, the cursor doesn't draw as smoothly as I would like, so users will need to make some adjustments. Images print with soft edges and clear resolution.\n\nThe big downside for me has been memory leaks and CPU hogging. Particularly when trying to paste material from another program, PE4 is as slow as a dial-up connection. It shouldn't take five minutes to import a track list or Christmas message from my Word program. And I should not see my CPU running up to 80 or 90%. Simply booting the program is slow compared to my other applications, and I can't see the justification for this.\n\nAlso, PE4 should not be seen as a substitute for a document design program. There are no geometry shapes or tables or chart wizards. Just strokes, lines, and your imported images.\n\nOn the whole, the program is pretty-looking and diverse enough for my bohemian tasks. It ought to serve any low-budget artist, especially students and hobbyists. However, Painter Essentials 4 does require a patch to deal with these slowdowns and memory leaks, which can drag out the simplest project. Also, the list price of $99 is too high--the Amazon.com figure of 45-55 bones is acceptable.", "summary": "Econo-Paint for Budget Artists", "unixReviewTime": 1229472000}

Its main problem is that Windows XP is also a superb operating system, and most users will have difficulty understanding why we needed more than an incremental upgrade from XP. To the extent that the Vista interface deviates from the XP menus, I mostly have found this to be simply irritating.\n\nThe main flaw with Vista is that it deliberately did not have backwards compatibility with many earlier-version Window drivers.  Some printers and other devices flat out would not work with Vista.  This was an outrageous decision by Microsoft and it ultimately doomed the operating system with many users and businesses as word of this incompatibility got around.  Windows 7 essentially corrected this fatal mistake years later.\n\nThat having been said, Vista with SP1 is very solid and reliable. In my experience on my Notebook computer, however, be advised that it runs a LOT faster and better with plenty of DRAM. It seems to need more DRAM to run well. My new Intel dual-core Notebook came with 1GB DRAM, which was usually enough in Windows XP (except for most imaging software, which needed at least 2GB). However, I splurged and upgraded the computer to 4GB DRAM, and the difference was literally night-and-day. Vista could get doggy with 1GB. With 4 GB DRAM it literally screams on my Intel dual-core machine.\n\nOne unforgivable lapse on the part of Microsoft with Vista Home Premium is that it does not include Fax support. In this day and age, this is truly astounding. This represents a very obnoxious decision by someone.\n\nThe Vista interface is prettier. What more can I say?\n\nOne thing I think that Microsoft needs to watch is the security options. Security features are all well and good, but at the end of the day the beauty of a microcomputer is that it frees most of us, most of the time, from dependence on the IT crew in the white labcoats. XP and Vista have so many security protocols that in some instances it is rekindling this dependence.\n\nOverall, I am satisfied with Vista, and I would not hesitate again to buy a computer that came pre-loaded with it. The upgrade learning curve from XP is really not all that great.", "summary": "Flawed due to poor driver backwards compatible.", "unixReviewTime": 1217808000}

Currently I am doing videos of the musicians who roam Sosua Beach hoping to earn money entertaining beach goers.  I've been using, and like, the AVS Video Editor but as PowerDirector 12 Ultimate was so highly recommended I decided to give it a try.\n\nIt is an impressive program and offers a lot, but it is not for me since what I shoot is pretty straightforward and makes little use of imaginative effects or theme templates.  But for someone interested in including those features in their videos, this is most certainly an editor to be considered.  It has very rich collection for those using the full editor.\n\nThe alternative in Ultiamate is an easy editor where everything is done almost automatically.  This editor does an excellent job and produces  very fine videos quickly and with little effort on the part of the maker.  The problem with this is that you can get the same features in PowerDirector Deluxe with a download of far fewer GBs  and a lower price.  Because the Ultimate version is so rich in features, it is a very big download.  Why add so many GBs to Drive C, or which ever drive your programs are on, if you aren't going to make use of those features?\n\nIf all I wanted to do was to take the video from camera and turn it into a video to post on YouTube, Vimeo, etc., then PowerDirector Deluxe would be my choice.  However, because I have more control in the editing with AVS Video Editor but without the addition of features I never use, I will stick with what has proved effective for me.\n\nIn between Director Deluxe and Director Ultimate is Director Ultra.  It is more like Ultimate than Deluxe, the main difference is that Ultimate lets you combine up to videos while with Ultra you work with just the one.\n\nWhichever version you choose, you will get a top notch program with good support, including my tutorials and an actdive helpful, forum.

I edit a consumer technology website so I feel very comfortable reviewing this product. Unfortunately, I can't give Microsoft Streets and Trips more than a lukewarm recommendation.\n\nLet's start with the installation of the the software. The installer program on the included DVD-ROM is easily confused by other startup applications ... so don't try to install this software until all of your Windows startup applications (antivirus, wireless assistants, etc.) have finished loading. Even a single background application can throw off the installation.\n\nOnce installed, the trip planning software works fine, but you can do the same thing faster, easier, and for free using Google Maps or Yahoo Maps online. The overall Streets and Trips software interface isn't very intuitive so expect to stumble around trying to figure out how it works the first few times you try to use it.\n\nOnce you're able to get the GPS receiver to lock onto satellites and provide directions, things don't get much better. The spoken turn-by-turn directions aren't always clear, and because of the weak GPS receiver (more on that later) you don't always get the verbal directions when you need them.\n\nThe included GPS receiver/USB dongle is large but doesn't provide very good reception. I live in Cincinnati, Ohio (a reasonably large US city) and half the time I cannot get the GPS receiver to lock onto a satellite. My Garmin nuvi 360 handheld GPS gets better satellite reception, is easier to use, and the spoken directions are easier to understand. The only major advantage to The Microsoft Streets and Trips software/GPS receiver combo is that you can install it on a laptop so you don't have to carry a laptop and a GPS when traveling ... you can just use your laptop. Of course, that's assuming the GPS receiver actually gets a signal and can provide turn-by-turn directions.\n\nThe software supposedly gets updates for traffic conditions, but it never seems to know when there's a major construction zone ahead ... even if it's a construction zone that has been there for several months. By comparison, my Garmin GPS almost always knows when I'm about to approach a construction zone and alerts me in advance.\n\nBottom line, I really can't recommend Microsoft Streets and Trips 2009 with GPS to anyone unless you can't afford a stand-alone GPS device or smartphone with built-in GPS. Yes, I suppose it's nice to be able to navigate using just your laptop in the car, but the weak GPS receiver sort of kills that benefit.", "summary": "When it works it's OK, but might not be worth the money.", "unixReviewTime": 1247702400}

Instead of tinkering here and there with each of them I would most likely be better served just learning one system but I have found that certain things are more intuitive and easier for me with one program than they are with the other and vice versa and so I guess I will continue to use both.\n\nOverall I would say that the biggest difference between Paintshop and Photoshop is the interface. Both offer the ability to do tons of different things to your photos but, whichever software you choose, you need to be willing to invest the time to learn how to do it.

Actually Id used a couple of different versions over the years. All of them required extensive effort spent training the Dragon before you could actually use it. Often, it included problems with the Dragon understanding my accent. With this version, there were none of those issues. I read one short paragraph and proceeded with the rest of the set up instructions. I also did the short tutorial. Once that was done, I opened a word document and proceeded to start dictating to it. It had very little trouble understanding what I was saying. Because of that alone, this is definitely a five-star piece of software.\n\nNow once its installed it is a wonderful piece software use, but the installation was the slowest installation of a program I have ever done. I was installing from a DVD, and it shouldve taken just a few minutes. However its been about 15 minutes with me wondering if the computer had frozen up. While my laptop is not top-of-the-line its also not bottom of the barrel and it is new. It uses Windows 8.1 operating system. Overall, I think it took 30 to 60 minutes just to install the program. I actually cooked dinner waiting for the installation to complete. Then, I had to come in and do the registration portion. At least the registration is quick and easy.\n\nIn the long run, I guess the slow installations worth the effort because the program is a very quick to learn to use. For people who never use Dragon NaturallySpeaking for used to take me weeks to train the program before it was fully usable. With this version, it took minutes. I have not learned all of the slight nuances of using Dragon yet, but it seems very user-friendly so far. Im thrilled at the ability to continue to write without causing pain in my arm. I highly recommend this program for anyone who has difficulty using their hands or arms for typing and mouse usage. It won't completely eliminate the need for keyboard or mouse use, but it makes it much easier to compose on your computer.\n\nAll software has a learning curve. This new version of Dragon speaking naturally has a very short learning curve before you're able to start using the program. Over the next few weeks, I anticipate learning a lot of the finer details of using the program. The only downside is when your spouse continues to talk to you and the mic begins to pick it up. Right now its a little bit slower than when I type myself, but with practice, I anticipate becoming quicker. Hopefully, one of the things that I will learn to do is how to edit a completed document by voice. Im thrilled with the program though.\n\nAs for what comes in the box, there is the DVD for insulation, a small booklet, and a headset. The headset has a mic of course. Its not the best headset in the world, however, it does work well with Dragon.

Instant Immersion has some useful aspects, but it is nowhere near Rosetta Stone, despite the company's claims to the contrary.\n\nThe Instant Immersion program is made up of three parts:\n\n* COMPUTER PROGRAM.  The computer program is actually four separate modules, titled \"Talk Now,\" \"Talk More,\" \"Talk the Talk,\" and \"Talk Business.\"  Each of the four modules contains ten sections, and a typical section presents a series of vocabulary words and/or phrases, written and spoken (up to 41 vocabulary words, though for some sections only five phrases). You can listen to the words or phrases, record yourself saying them so you can play back and evaluate yourself, play some games to test your knowledge (\"choose the correct word,\"  \"choose the correct picture,\" \"choose the appropriate phrase,\" etc.) and there are even flashcards to print out.  OK.\n\nThe modules superficially resemble Rosetta Stone in that there are picture- and word-matching games to play on your computer, and a series of new words presented in each section.  However, Rosetta Stone differs in three important ways - First, RS uses the computer interaction to teach grammar, not just a list of vocabulary words (for example you have to choose the correct conjugation). Second, the RS lessons build on each other, with later lessons using and reinforcing vocabulary and grammar learned earlier. Instant Immersion only presents independent lists. Third, and most important, RS has voice recognition, whereas II only lets you record yourself and listen to the playback. According to the Instant Immersion manual, the human ear is more sensitive than a computer, so recording and playback is better. Not so. A native speaker would certainly be better at evaluating pronunciation, but a naive speaker doesn't know what to listen for.\n\n* MP3s.  The Instant Immersion package also includes a collection of MP3 tracks, arranged into 16 lessons, with the lessons being roughly between 30 minutes and an hour each. (So, a LOT of audio time). The beginning lessons are slow, deliberate, and tortuous (\"The Spanish word for ___ is ___..... The Spanish word for ____ is ____.... etc.), but things do pick up quickly, with both grammar instruction and dialog/conversation to listen to. When I used a previous version of Instant Immersion the package consisted entirely of these tracks, and this is clearly still the focus of the package. The disk also has a PDF transcript, which will help with the more complex dialogs.\n\nBy comparison, the audio tracks I got with Rosetta Stone just consisted of more of the same dialog you were listening to when using the RS computer program - useful for honing your ear and accent, but incredibly boring.  I do have to admit that some of Instant Immersion's audio lessons are more useful, inasmuch as they actually explain grammatical theory (something RS doesn't do at all, since their paradigm is to learn grammar from exposure and interaction, like a native speaker would).  Just to throw a third player into the mix, for basic number and letter drills, and for conversations, you might actually do better streaming some episodes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Plaza-Sesamo/dp/B003D8PWTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Plaza Sesamo</a>.\n\n* VIDEO DVD.  Rosetta Stone had online videos that were actually entertaining, so I had high hopes for this DVD.  It is, however, just more of the same vocabulary and games from the computer program, with slightly enhanced video clips. You can interact with the games using your DVD player remote, but otherwise I'm not sure what the point  is here.\n\n* OTHER STUFF. Rosetta Stone has online games to play over the Internet, and multiplayer activities. They have also apparently added native speaker instruction since I wrote my review. Instant Immersion has none of these things.  Instant Immersion touts a \"pocket phrase guide,\" but this is a two-page joke. II also supposedly offers a tablet app, but I have not been successful in downloading this. The app appears to be more of the same computer program.\n\nOverall, Instant Immersion is a useful vocabulary drill, but I am extremely skeptical that you could actually learn Spanish using this package (beyond \"How much?\" and \"Where is my suitcase?\")  Had the company not claimed to be a replacement for Rosetta Stone, I might have given it four stars.", "summary": "Instant Immersion vs Rosetta Stone - an actual comparison", "unixReviewTime": 1449273600}

I remember the days of when a new PKZip came out, you re-compressed everything because of better compression rates. Over time (and especially once Windows came into being) PKZip stagnated, and I eventually moved to WinRAR instead of WinZip when that came out, as the early WinZips were nothing to write home about. Later on, when PKWare introduced the new zipx format, I switched back. Have been there since.\n\nThat brings us to this one, WinZip 18. I love some of the nice small interface features here. All your modern compressors integrate with the OS well enough, but it's the little \"touchy feely\" things that make it work for me. For some reason I love the end of compression summary screen on this software. It's nothing special, but as a guy from the ancient days of BBS's, I loved seeing those minimal increases in space savings by using the latest, and this screen speaks to that for some reason.\n\nA lot of what is in this software goes way beyond simple file compression. In this day and age when Windows has \"compressed folders\" built in, they have to diffentiate themselves.  To me, that is their zipx compression routines.  These compress files a lot smaller, however, it could be viewed as a different file format.  The tried and true old school zip file is not compatible with zipx.  Given I rarely share my zip files, I use zipx exclusively on my system.  However, I have to share, I need to pick the older compression format so other programs and other people can read them. The newer compression methods (zipx) will actually compress jpg files - something that up until relatively recently wasn't possible. They do this without data loss to the image, too. But this stuff has been the last 3-4 major revisions to WinZip anyway.\n\nSome other stuff that you can do with zip files in this Pro version that you can't with standard old Windows Compressed folders is..\n\n* You can zip and encrypt file attachments in email\n* You can schedule certain files for periodic zipping/archiving\n* Password protect your zip files - Windows \"Compressed Folders\" can't do that.\n* You can preview images inside Zip archives\n* You can add watermarks\n* You can convert things to a PDF\n* You can share files to Facebook, Linkedin, & Twitter (!)\n\nSomething else v18 is a big drive to cloud based services such as Box, SkyDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive, CloudMe, and SugarSync.  The last two I've never even heard of, but they're trying to make WinZip into a file server of sorts that will take your files and send them to these services by itself.  For me personally, I have no use of that, but I can see where some would.\n\nIf you use these services a lot, Winzip could be used to automate/batch process files on your system and send them there.\n\nHowever, for me personally, I use it pretty much for local file archiving and organization.  In this day and age, one doesn't really need to save tons of space when one has multiple terabytes of storage on their system.  I use it to archive directories into single files mostly - things like old web page archives where you have 4000 files spread out over 150 sub directories.  It's easier to store in a single file, and for me that's the reason I use WinZip mostly.  Yeah, compressed folders could probably do that, but not nearly as nicely as WinZip does.\n\nSo yeah, if you're in need of archiving/moving files to the cloud that goes beyond the basics of what built into Windows functions can do, then you'd probably benefit by looking at this software.\n\nI give it four stars over five, as I'd actually prefer it to be a bit simpler, while there's a lot in here, there's also a lot I'll never use - it's got that \"shoot a squirrel with a 357 magnum\" feel somewhat.  Yeah, it can do some things, but I'll never use them.", "summary": "Very feature packed software, goes way beyond simple file compression", "unixReviewTime": 1397606400}

It is commonly referred to as the \"Operations in Progress\" bug. I sense that Acronis regards it as a \"feature,\" not a \"bug.\"\n\nThe problem is with the backup scheduler. Often security-conscious people connect USB drives only for the purpose of making full backups; then they disconnect them to keep them truly safe from power surges, fire, viruses, and other catastrophes--sometimes storing the backups in a vault or off-site. Indeed, this is considered a \"best practice\" in the IT field. So strongly is this practice recommended that a security audit of a computer site will typically call out the operation for not having at least some of its backups stored off-site. Yet, the Acronis backup scheduler always assumes that the backup should be connected. When you attempt to shut down the computer on a day that a backup is set to occur, if the external drive is not connected, suddenly a message will appear during shutdown stating: \"Operations are in Progress...Please Wait....\" And wait, and wait, and wait.\n\nThe message causes confusion because it appears to be a Windows message and is not identified as being displayed by Acronis software. Moreover, it does not state what is really going on. The message means: \"Acronis is trying to access your external USB drive and will continue to try forever.\" This freezes the shutdown process, because the software is so lame that it does not time out. Eventually, you will have to physically power down the computer.\n\nThis has messed up Windows Updates a few times, because Windows update activities often occur during the shutdown and reboot processes.\n\nOne would hope that there would be a workaround. Why not set the scheduler to \"never\" do a backup? Tried that, but strangely, the scheduler does not retain a setting of \"never\"--it actually flips back to a default schedule cycle. It's as if the person writing this code wants to FORCE the customer into having a regular backup scheduling cycle. OK, what about disabling the scheduler process through msconfig? If you do that, Acronis True Image simply won't work. It has to have the scheduling process running in order to do a backup.\n\nA web search on \"operations in progress Acronis\" will reveal the widespread irritation and inconvenience this bug has caused. Acronis has yet to come up with a solution that actually works.\n\nIt is ironic that a company specializing in a computer security product would work AGAINST the safest way of handling backups on a customer's own, variable schedule based on actual need--to disconnect and safely store the backup medium when the backup has completed. Again: the advantage of having a secure backup is eroded if the backup medium cannot be stored in a safe place away from the computer.\n\nDo such catastrophes occur? Yes, all the time. That's why we make backups! I have personally seen cases where power surges have traveled through connecting cables to peripheral equipment and have fried them all. Not to speak of fires, floods, tornadoes, theft, etc.\n\nBy contrast, Acronis has done years of backups and several restores without incident, and has a clever disk cloning operation that seamlessly clones to a different-sized disk.\n\nThe bottom line is: customers should not have to put up with this. If the code is written well, it should be simple and inexpensive to add a timeout of, say one minute. Or to change the settings to truly allow the scheduler to be turned off. The \"Operations in Progress\" message could be changed to something meaningful. Or preferably, Acronis should implement all three of these solutions. They could be distributed to existing customers as an update. But it hasn't happened.\n\nIf it has not been corrected by the time you wish to make a purchase, look for a different product.", "summary": "Intrusive bug never fixed", "unixReviewTime": 1399420800}

In the long run, Office 365 is a better deal than buying a downloadable, installable product--because you *get* a downloadable, installable product with this deal.\n\nSo what exactly are you getting here?\n\nThis package is the ability to use the latest version of Office in the browser--meaning, if you're on a machine that doesn't have Office installed, you can log into your Microsoft account (required) and use browser-based versions of all the Office apps.  This also means that the online storage place called \"OneDrive\" (formerly known as \"SkyDrive\") can be used to store up to one TeraByte (1,000GB) of stuff, anything you like, private or public or just shared out as you wish.\n\nIt's ALSO the ability to download and install Office 2013 OR Office 2016, on up to 5 machines, for up to 4 people!  That's the cool part.  In the past, you might have to buy more than one copy of Office, or be the sole user, or only put it on a desktop and a laptop.  Now I can put this on my desktop, laptop, and Surface Pro, then install it on my wife's PC and my daughter can also have a copy installed to use.  I've been running Office 2016 for the most part and have been pretty happy with the way it works.  2016 is not hugely different from 2013 or 2010, just in little ways.\n\nThis package lets you use Office for a year.  You can buy two or three and stack them to prolong your subscription (if you're afraid the price of Office will go up) or you can extend your subscription to more people (in case you have a bunch of kids and want to add mom and dad and grandma into the number of users).  I added a year using this code.  It was only easy to do because I looked online first for HOW to do it.\n\nWhich brings us to the only real drawback to Office 365:  anything to do with the browser.  The browser-based apps try to be as much like the desktop as possible, but they're still not quite the same.  OneNote is probably the closest match I've seen, while Outlook is the ugliest and least useful.  The fact that the browser-based versions run in Azure (\"the Cloud\", a.k.a., \"on the Internet\") means that they typically run a bit slower, depending on your Internet connection.  OneDrive is more annoying to manage using the browser, so I find myself using a computer to do most of the work like uploading files/folders, creating new folders, etc.  I use the browser-based OneDrive interface to download individual stuff or share stuff out to people.  The entire browser interface is trying to do the \"Kanban\" look that you also see in Windows 8's \"Metro-now-called-Modern\" apps and parts of Windows 10's look and feel.\n\nMy rule of thumb is that the browser-based Office is for small tasks on the go, but for anything substantial I go with the PC.\n\nYou also have to use the Office website to mange things like who you share Office with, or how you download.  They make it annoyingly over-complicated to download the 64-bit version of Office if you don't want to use the 32-bit.  You have to choose \"Install-->Language and Install Options-->Additional Install Options--> then pick the specific 64-bit version you want.  There's no good reason to bury the better-performing version that far down except that they hope it prevents tech support complications.\n\nThe Home Subscription is: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, and a 1TB bump-up to OneDrive, up to 4 people across 5 machines.\nThe Personal Subscription is the same, but only for one individual user, on up to 5 machines.\nThe Business version has a lot of other options *and* things to consider when choosing.\n\nOverall, I find this a much better deal than shelling out a few hundred dollars up front and knowing the next version will require me to buy it again, and I don't get the benefit of the added OneDrive storage space.  With this price, it's cheaper and I will always have the option of downloading the latest version of Office or sticking with the one I have.  The browser-based versions I consider an afterthought, or \"bonus feature\" - I wouldn't rely solely on those for everyday work.  And I would like to see managing the subscriptions and installs get a bit easier.", "summary": "Times have changed", "unixReviewTime": 1446076800}

I had paid $79 for iWork '09 because it was having some staying power as the current version, and so on a whim I thought I would go and see what 2008 vintage Macintosh computing would be like, using my iMac 2.8GHz that I reviewed under iMac MB325LL/A. So since the iMac came with a Summer 2008 version of Leopard and iLife '08, I thought I would give iWork '08 a whirl since the iMac was overheating running the '09 versions of iWork and iLife and Leopard 10.5.8, not to mention Snow Leopard or Lion, or especially Mountain Lion.\n\nWell, Pages and Numbers are lacking in features and the presentation of all three of them isn't quite as polished, but one little thing that really bugged me about the newer version of iWork, specifically Keynote '09 (some \"builds\" were only available as building in, while others were only available building out), was not the case on my copy of iWork '08. Other people's copies may be different, but iWork '08 proved that sometimes the grass is greener on the other side, even if it often isn't.\n\nSeeing as how I love Keynote (always been fascinated by presentation programs, in fact I went to great efforts to take Microsoft Office for Mac 4.2.1 off of a Workgroup Server 6150 and put it on our primary family computer of the time, a Performa 6116CD to show you how much I loved presentation software) this was a delightful surprise making iWork '08 worth what I paid for it, which was $20 plus insignificant shipping, and it may find permanent use when I permanently semi-retire the iMac, which isn't totally through with school tasks yet, just taking a school task break to help increase it's longevity as much as possible.\n\nSo in the end, for what iWork '09 really let me down on but iWork '08 succeeded on, it's every bit as 5-starred as iWork '09, because I have Microsoft Office:mac 2008 Home and Student and 2 copies of Office 2007 I can rely on for more advanced stuff.\n\nI love iWork, once it got a spreadsheet app, which means iWork '08 or later. iWork before Numbers had too gaping a hole in my opinion.", "summary": "I can't explain this, as iWork '09 is supposedly better", "unixReviewTime": 1335657600}

Lately it's been either Microsoft Word or Open Office. I've been pretty happy with both.

But.. I didn't like it. Not at all.\n\nThe first problem, and biggest, is that it crashed every time I tried to open an existing Word document. It is supposed to be capable of handling practically every format, and yet any .doc file not created in WordPerfect crashed the software.

I thought it was obnoxious, complicated and ugly. I hate looking at the screen. I hate zooming in and out. I hate changing the format. Again, maybe I'm stuck in my ways, but I don't like it. My reasons may not be the best and are mostly cosmetic, except for the crashing, which literally happens all the time - right now, for example, it just crashed for no reason. All I was doing was testing some of the different toolbars! Still, I'm uninstalling it ASAP and going back to OpenOffice, which, generally speaking isn't that great.\n\nOVERALL: Don't buy! I don't know why it crashes all the time, but it does and the last thing you want is an important document to be ruined by terrible software.

They're so easy to get immersed in, with hours of fun and detective work being spent playing them. \"Danger on Deception Island\" continues this great series on a wonderful route, and continues to be one of the best Nancy Drew games released to this date.\n\nNancy's friends Bess and George have arranged a vacation for her. Nancy will be staying with Katie Firestone, a marine biologist friend of George's, in Snake Horse Harbor, Deception Island (one of the San Juan Islands off the cost of Washington state). Nancy is immediately greeted by Katie, who was just getting back to her houseboat from getting groceries. When the two make it back to the boat, they discover that it's been ransacked and vandalized. Could this be the latest work done by an unknown group that's been robbing shops around town? Not only that, but an orphaned killer whale has recently made home in the harbor surrounding the town, and seems to be hanging around all by itself for no apparent reason.  Just who did this to Katie? Who are these vandals and robbers? And what's the real deal with this orca? It's now up to Nancy to submerge herself into the dangers surrounding Snake Horse Harbor to find the truth...\n\n\"Danger on Deception Island\" employs amazing graphics. Even though this game is a bit older, several of the graphics in this game could rival those used in games today. The suspects look so realistic that they almost look like actual actors and actresses. The graphics seen while kayaking, exploring the town, and walking on the beaches are nothing short of beautiful. Some real (or at least, realistic) photos of sea life are also presented throughout game play, which is a definite bonus. I felt like I was actually walking through a town by the beach while playing this game, instead of just playing a game featuring one.\n\n\"Danger on Deception Island\" has some of the best mini games, puzzles, and challenges that had been seen in Nancy Drew games upon its release. I especially enjoyed the mini games in Whale World (one of the explorable areas in the game). However, are several ways to die multiple times in this game (which doesn't bother me, but does some others), and one of the puzzles that involves getting a set of coordinates is very challenging and time-consuming. Aside from that puzzle, I can't complain at all.\n\nAll of the characters had their quirks, but they were a pretty well-casted bunch. Every suspect fit the story rather nicely, and they all had moments when they looked like they could be the culprit. The culprit becomes rather shocking, as there are several clues that come up and point toward another character(s) at the end of the game, until the ultimate truth is revealed. I could hardly wrap my mind around the fact that this character was the guilty party, but it was definitely a very tasteful twist (though I still would've slightly preferred the culprit being somebody else).\n\nThe first suspect met is Katie Firestone, who's a friend of George's and a marine biologist. She's pretty strong-willed, and definitely has some secrets that she's hiding from Nancy. Holt Scotto is an elderly fisherman who's running for harbor master, and doesn't particularly like Katie's defense of a policy that forces boats to stay several feet away from the whale (as he has to take the long way to get out to sea). Jenna Deblin is the owner of the Hot Kettle Caf, and thinks Katie has a lot of secrets as to what she truly wants to do with the whale (i.e. study it instead of help it). Andy Jason is the owner of Whale World, a tourist attraction that specializes in educating visitors in facts about whales, and wants Katie to sell out to him.\n\nWhat really made the characters awesome was dialogue shared between Nancy and her phone friends. The conversations had with Bess and George and Frank and Joe Hardy were all very nicely scripted. Not a single one ever felt boring. The one-time phone friends were pretty memorable in their own ways too, such as Casey Porterfield (who constantly has a hard time understanding Nancy) and Hilda Swenson (she's so... well, I'll let you find out for yourself). The phone friends in this game were much better than the phone friends in several games were, and I would definitely like to see some of the one-timers make a second appearance.\n\nThe musical score in this game was awesome, which could be said about every single game created before it. However, this game does have a bit more going for it musically, as it definitely goes out of its way to make itself unique. The game features a lot of songs that sounded like they belonged in a movie about sailors, or from a kid's special to educate children about the seas and those who travel them. I felt like it went out of its way to make itself more \"beachy\" than other soundtracks have to make themselves \"scarier\" or more \"royal\". The realistic sounds of waves, seagulls, and seals made the music all the more fitting.\n\nSo, is Danger on Deception Island the best Nancy Drew game ever? I'd say it ranks among them. There are very few complains that I can make about this game, as nearly everything about it goes above and beyond. I would love to see Nancy re-visit Deception Island in a future case, as well as meet several of the characters she met here again.

Jentsch", "reviewText": "I installed Office 2010 as an upgrade from Office 2007 on a Windows 7 64-bit PC. The installation went off without a hitch, but I would have liked to have been given a clearer indication of when I could choose which of the products were installed.\n\nMy primary use of Office 2010 is Outlook, followed by Word and Excel. Probably the best thing that can be said about Office 2010 from an upgrader's perspective is that it installed easily and it isn't a major revision to the software. However, for someone paying list price for this software title, I haven't found much reason for someone that owns the same applications of the 2007 variety to upgrade.\n\nThe interfaces of each program have been fine-tuned, and perhaps some functionality here and there is better than it used to be. However, for those of us that want to use our products to get our work done, the differences that might number in the hundreds during an exhaustive review just don't make themselves obvious.\n\nMy biggest disappointment continues to be with Outlook. Spam is by far the most egregious problem facing anyone that uses E-Mail. It sucks your productivity away, embarrasses you when an important client correspondence gets shuffled into the spam folder, and is generally annoying.\n\nOutlook's handling of spam hasn't changed since I first used Outlook 2003 so many years ago. It uses profiles that are updated periodically by Microsoft and white lists and black lists that you set up to determine the likelihood that an incoming message is spam. Back then, I found a much superior spam-fighting tool called SpamBayes that worked as a plug-in for Outlook and ran circles around Outlook's built-in solution by using Bayesian filtering to learn what constitutes spam that you receive. It got better as you used it, learning which messages were good and which were bad, and you could \"feed\" it both good and bad messages to help it learn faster.\n\nAfter all this time, Microsoft still can't do spam filtering as good as that freeware effort by a couple of individuals. Unfortunately, an update to Outlook 2007 broke the ability for SpamBayes to operate correctly, so I had to stop using it. While writing this review, I decided to check to see if development has restarted on SpamBayes, and it appears that it has, which is good news indeed!\n\nIf you are currently using Office 2007 with satisfaction, I see little need at this point to upgrade to 2010. If you need to move to Office, or buy another copy, Office 2010 seems to work much in the same way as 2010 and documents created in each seem to interoperate without any problem.\n\nIf Microsoft had just improved their spam filtering in Outlook, that would be worth the upgrade price all by itself. Spam is that big of a problem, and the cost of the package would be outweighed by the time it would save those of us who have to deal with it every day of our lives.\n\nBesides some small tweaks, where is the innovation, Microsoft?\n\nFor those that have not gone down the Microsoft Office path and are locked into its solutions, you would do well to look into the many open source and free options that are available.\n\nGoogle's GMail is excellent at spam filtering, and its interface is pretty good. It's not completely up to the integration of Outlook, but it's getting close, and the world is moving to cloud-based computing with blinding speed. Having all your E-Mail available to you from anywhere is very spoiling, and it makes using a PC-based client like Outlook seem perfectly archaic by comparison.\n\nI have not explored the other solutions, such as Google Docs for doing written documents and spreadsheets, but the little bit of time I've spent with them show them to be useful for all but the power users in many situations.\n\nMicrosoft needs to innovate to keep up. Maybe Office 2010 is the foundation that gets Office mostly right, and now they can use that foundation to start innovating again. Maybe. If they don't, they will be passed by, and people will look back at the last couple of decades and say \"remember when we used to have to use Outlook for E-Mail? Remember trying to do a mail merge in Word - yikes!\"\n\nAll that said, if you need Office, you need it. The best that I can say is that it doesn't seem to be much different from Office 2007, which wasn't all that different from Office 2003. Whether you need to spend this kind of money on the functionality it provides is completely up to you.", "summary": "Slightly spiffed up version of Office 2007, but Outlook still missing decent spam features", "unixReviewTime": 1295395200}

A few remaining commercial record companies with good lawyers are making out very well with the present arrangement; 2. owners of copyrights are able to enjoy royalties and restrict use of their songs--even to the extent of shutting-down Wikiphonia, a musician-based source of musical literature that was not merely a necessity for financially-challenged musicians but a means of keeping alive \"the Great American Songbook.\"  Instead, those songs are limited to the elite few, and musicians can obtain copies of them at $4 per page (a musician is lucky to make $40 playing a 4-hour job--requiring him to bring his own piano!

For all of 2016 my downloads--for which I pay a monthly fee entitling me to download at half Apple's and Amazon's prices--are simply not to be found.  The company has responded with detailed instructions, but it's at the point of misdirected labor and time for little to no return.  None of the downloads appears anywhere on my computer.

Unfortunately Kaspersky is greedy beyond belief and wanted more for a simple license renewal than I could buy a whole new boxed version at a local brick and mortar store.\n\nI checked Amazon and they had AV 2009 for under twelve bucks (unexplicably today they are selling the same \"old version\" for sixty bucks.

I immediately began having problems saving files because the AV software was trying to protect the file.  How can anyone work with MS Office if they can't save files?  If I turn KAV2009 off, Office works perfectly, turn it back on and the problem happens again. There is no doubt that the AV software is at fault.  How can any software manufacturer try to sell a product that doesn't work with MS Office?\n\nI've had it for about a week and simply can't live with the turtle-slow performance so even though I have almost a full year to go I have ordered another brand to replace it.

I don't really understand how the interface is supposed to work. Apparently you can only switch between workspaces if you've saved your document first, or whatever you've got loaded goes away? Or is it the workspace itself you're supposed to save? Needless to say, this is a bit of a problem for this review.\n\nThat said, this is still a pretty good program once you figure out exactly what's going on. The interface is similar to Photoshop Elements, with Manage, Adjust, and Edit workspaces that you can (somehow) switch between. As it happens, I generally prefer to use GIMP, and PaintShop compares pretty favorably to that too. There's plenty of tools; anything you need to do can probably be done here; in Adjust mode, you get a pile of filters and tweaks (iPhoto-style), while in Edit mode you get a full photo-paint interface, with a huge selection of filters and Photoshop-style layers. Basically, it's pretty much everything you might be looking for. As for the ancillary programs, I haven't really looked at them.\n\nThis is a pretty versatile program, and quite a bargain to boot. However, getting up and running in it is likely to take a while, stumbling through menus and preference panes to figure out exactly what's going on before you get your workflow going. This isn't a huge liability, but it's definitely a pain if you're, say, a reviewer with a limited period of time to learn your way through.

X9 has some very big improvements over the other editions.  For this being the Ultimate, they do charge you extra to be able to authorize Blu-ray discs, something that leaves a bad taste in your mouth.\n\nThis is a very difficult review to write as I am gearing it toward those who have never used this program before and those who like us have used previous versions and are familiar with this software.\n\nI will touch on high points and give an overview trying to keep it as concise as I can.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT FROM THIS EDITION (GENERAL OVERVIEW)\nStop Motion Capability\nStandard Definition and HD quality videos\nCan do In Depth video editing from multiple video sources\nCan add and customize audio timelines with in depth capabilities\nComes with fast flick easy editing mode (quick and easy video projects)\nScreen Capture for anything you do on your computer\nAdditional programs for creating custom text and video effects\nLots of transitions ,animations, templates for lots of creativity\n64bit program for faster rendering time\n\nNEW FEATURES WHICH WERE ADDED IN THIS EDITION\nMulti camera editor (supports up to six cameras and two additional soundtracks with multiple sync points including Audio Markers)\nEnhanced audio capabilities (Select multiple audio tracks to normalize audio)\nCan customize attack and decay (ramp in and ramp out of sound)\nThey have enhanced audio ducting to be able to work on multiple clips at same time\nIncludes new Blue Video effects (exclusive to the Ultimate version)\nCreate custom templates for Fast Flick\nCan share templates with other people\nNow supports HVEC which is H.265 video format\nSupports MSF video format (exclusive to the Ultimate version)\nImproved .MP4 and .mov performance\nOptimized for 6th gen Intel I7 chipsets\nEnhanced motion tracking\n\nCOMMENTS\nThe multi camera editor can take all sorts of video from various sources and use them in sync.  So if you took video from your cell phone and a video camera, you can sync them up with this program.  From our experience it seems to work quickly and without glitch so far.\n\nThe new audio enhancements seem to be pretty cool.  Now you can select multiple tracks and be able to normalize the audio a lot faster than before.  This makes the work flow much faster than previous versions.  Audio ducting moves at a much faster pace in work load since you can do many clips at the same time manually or automatically.  It works pretty easily without issue so far.\n\nNew Enhanced Motion tracking will track motion up to four points in the video as compared to the previous versions only able to do one.  This makes witness protection in video a lot more effective and easier to do with less room for misses and errors to better protect identities.\n\nThere are a lot of different options for outsourcing videos.  You can outsource via web (Facebook, YouTube, social media, etc), DVDs, SD cards,\nHTML5,  and portable devices.\n\nOne of the most exciting parts of this package is the 30 day membership to the Studio Backlot.  This is a fantastic boost for beginners to experienced users.  The video tutorials go into great depth explaining the features - old and new- of this program.  This is probably the most beneficial part of this package as it really takes the user to a new level of willingness to experiment and learn the program.  It really can push a user, regardless of previous experience to new heights not previously possible so quickly from this program.  Before this feature, it took a lot more time and research to try to figure out all of the capabilities of what Corel VideoStudio could do.  Now, it is all laid out for you and you can take as much time as you need for 30 days to learn with optional membership after the 30 day period is up to continue with the Studio Backlot at like $7ish dollars a month which is not too bad if you need more time.\n\nThere are other programs that Studio Backlot that you can view tutorials from as well in addition to the Video Studio.\n\nDRAWBACK\nIn previous versions, you were able to create Blu-rays.  However, in this version, you are not able to create Blu-rays until you pay $8 to unlock that feature.  Considering that this is supposed to be the Ultimate version, I found that to be very irritating.  Why should we have to pay MORE to make high definitions Blu-rays when we always could make them in previous versions I have had included.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\nIf you want to do some powerful and professional video editing, the multi-camera editing features with enhancements will make the job a LOT easier and faster.  Faster workflow and fantastic tutorials through the Studio Backlot make this an excellent program to use.  We are still very disappointed that we have to pay EXTRA for Blu-ray capability, but the program is still well done.\n\nBecause of the exclusion of Blu-ray without extra fees attached, I am giving this four stars.  They should never have kept that feature out of this version with all of the great improvements.\n\nI will update as time goes on and we are able to use this program more and I can comment with more detail and perhaps even edit comments with new information.\n\n I will also update with our computer specs for the computer we installed this on soon.", "summary": "Fantastic New Improvements For Fast Workflow, BUT Be Prepared To Pay Additional Fee For Blu-Ray", "unixReviewTime": 1460419200}

My experiences in this have been enduring constant frustration with Liquid Edition 6 and then some video editing solace with Sony Vegas.  With my recent upgrade to Windows Vista I not only was one of the few absolutely delighted with the switch I also found a nice, extremely user-friendly video editing program in the new Windows Movie Maker.  Of course, Windows Movie Maker is also rather limited.  What it does it does well. But if a person wants to go beyond that they had to take a rather big leap to the next levels of programs.\n\nWith Corel Ulead VideoStudio I find an amazing progression from absolutely basic/entry level to highly functional and flexible.  Again and again recently I have found Corel to be the master of designing programs that are both highly capable and highly oriented towards the user experience.  Meaning their programs do a lot and are always surprising how easy they are to pick up and use.  This video software is no exception. It has the user friendliness of Windows Movie Maker with substantially more capability and options.\n\nThe learning curve is very slight.  Not because everything can be picked up quick but rather because Corel has approached this program understanding that not everyone can spend the hours and hours learning about software before getting to a real project.  Instead, they have built in different modes of working.  From the really basic Wizard that is a lot like movie maker to a more robust editing context that allows for a whole lot of creativity.\n\nAnd within that more expansive creativity they have made for a very wonderful ease of use, with the layout and the functions quite easily recognizable and quite easily applied. The arcane qualities of most video software are pushed aside for very clear, very obvious tools.\n\nAt each step I found myself easing my way into more and more knowledge.  And that's another quality I've noticed with Corel. The software itself is a teacher in a way.  And not a boring one. Rather, unlike so much headache inducing software (Liquid Edition) this Corel was actually fun. Again the emphasis on the user came out.\n\nNo this is not as robust as some other programs.  But it is also significantly less expensive and significantly less resource demanding. I used it on my high quality Dell XPS 710 quad processor, 4GB, up to date video card, Windows Vista desktop (noticing it was faster than other video programs). Of course it worked well on that.  I also used it on my Dell e1405 XP laptop, bought for battery life, that has no video card, sound card, and only 1GB of memory.  It didn't run as fast, of course, but it still worked great. Surprisingly great.\n\nI'm absolutely pleased with VideoStudio and will be heartily recommending it to friends and family. I've not gotten even to the full extent of learning this program--I'm excited about applying Flash to future video projects--and yet I don't feel like I'm missing anything.\n\nThis is an ideal mid-level video software meant for people who want to step up in their production but don't want to, or need to, invest in the higher level programs. It's very user friendly, very processor/memory friendly, while offering a wonderful progression of capability for any level user--whether the absolute beginner or the master wanting to do something quick and without bother.\n\nLove this and look forward to a lot more video work in coming months and years.  Corel has made it actually fun.  And that is a huge thing for those of us who don't particularly love sitting in front of the computer all the time.", "summary": "A wonderful mid-level product", "unixReviewTime": 1214438400}

This virtual machine is incredibly easy to install and use.  It provides a set-up Wizard that takes the user step-by-step through its use, with tutorials, and through the installation of Windows or other operating system such as Linux.\n\nThe VM creates a separate machine environment in a single window; it looks like a desk top within a desk top, with Mac OS \"liquid\" buttons at the top and an exact replica (for lack of a better word) of the operating system start up screen.  Don't be fooled, however; this is not a Mac OS masquerading as Windows.  It is a complete version of the secondary operating system, with all its rules and procedures.  You can quit VM, but it will only suspend Windows.  To shut down the virtual machine, you have to click on the \"turn off computer\" button on the Windows desk top (it will not shut down your Mac, only Windows, which \"thinks\" it is its own computer).  To use Windows-environment programs, you must install them as though the VM screen is your actual computer.  At any time, you can return to the Mac environment by clicking outside the \"desk top\" screen.\n\nThis software is best for high-powered Macs.  Running two operating systems can tax your computer if it doesn't have the memory and speed to handle it.  My Mac Mini, with 2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo and 2 GB RAM, has no problem, although it doesn't have the necessary 3D graphics support, so that sometimes causes problems when running games.  And I've had a couple of Mac program crashes when Windows is trying to update itself.  Most times, however, this software runs smoothly and without issues.  The problems are minor compared to the advantages it offers, and most are due to Windows, not to VMware Fusion.\n\nEspecially for people who are making the switch between a PC and a Mac, this software offers the comfort of a familiar environment, with the ability to use the few programs made for Windows only.  The Mac OS is far superior to Windows, however, so don't make the mistake of continuing to buy Windows software just because you own VMware Fusion.

Closer runner-ups would be: essential, time-saver, productivity enhancer, precise, breakthrough - and I may be able to validate these and move them into the first tier of descriptors eventually but a couple more months of daily use may be needed.\n\nI am using the Dragon with my email (Outlook and Gmail), text messengers such as Microsoft's Communicator, producing quick drafts and with some internet Browser (Chrome) activities such as navigating inside the active tab (page up/down), switching tabs and quick Google and Wikipedia searches. Also some interaction with the Operating System such as opening/closing apps, saving docs and so on. But, of course, there's a lot more to the Dragon than what I am using it so I will provide what will hopefully be a brief overview based on my own experience.\n\nOPERATION\n\nDragon works is by listening to your spoken words and trying to make sense of what it hears. If it decides that the words were a 'command', the Dragon decides whether the command concerns the Dragon itself or whether it has to do with the Operating System or the foreground application. Then the command is executed. Otherwise, the Dragon listens to the stream of spoken words and identifies words based on context, statistics of past word usage, custom vocabulary, user-provided training, user profile data, etc., etc. Once the words are identified, the output is produced based on yet another set of rules.\n\nSETTING UP THE DRAGON\n\nThe initial setup was not exactly 'quick' but the no-nonsense thoroughness actually persuaded me that I was dealing with a serious, mature, well-thought piece of software.\n\nOne of Setup's first steps is to identify an 'audio source' and Dragon supports most audio inputs a PC supports: USB, Bluetooth, a microphone or a digital recorder plugged into the Line-in jack, sound files, a Pocket PC device used as a digital recorder.\n\nAfter the audio source is identified, the user will specify his/her age, location (US, NZ, Australia, UK, India, SE Asia...), accent (standard American, Middle America, Southern, Indian, Australian, UK...).\n\nThen, training begins. Volume and the audio equipment quality is tested, then the user is asked to read a specific test. To further enhance its word-guessing capabilities the Dragon then ask for permission to take a look at the user's text documents (My Docs) and emails.\n\nThis completes the initial setup.\n\nTRAINING THE DRAGON\n\nAs suspected, the setup is just the beginning. To improve word recognition accuracy, the user is expected to constantly fine-tune the application or rather the profile that the Dragon creates for the user.\n\nThere are user-initiated tasks such as adding-removing words from Dragon's written form/spoken form vocabulary listing, by asking the Dragon to take a look at more documents or emails, creating simple new commands that can be universal or application specific or using a full-fledged scripting language to produce more complex outputs from word commands. The user can also train the Dragon on specific words by speaking the word into the microphone and providing the associated spelling.\n\nIn addition, the Dragon has the ability to learn and improve its accuracy by periodically reviewing its past activities - there are several tasks that do that periodically while the user-focused portion of the Dragon is not running.\n\nRIDING THE DRAGON\n\nI confess that I was highly skeptical before trying this out. I expected a low word recognition rate, an unacceptable degradation in my laptop's performance and apps freezing or crashing while the Dragon was on.  I was proven wrong on all of the above.\n\nMy very first few sentences spoken into the Dragon were recognized 100% - I suppose the Dragon struggles hard to make a good first impression. Ever since, the Dragon's ability to recognize my commands as commands and execute them and to properly interpret my words stayed high enough. I am now comfortable to use the Dragon on all my casual emails (Gmail) and on my office emails (I do check before I say 'send' and I do enter the 'to' and 'cc' names manually), on all my instant text messages and on 'first draft' office documents.\n\nAgain, surprisingly, my computer did slow down appreciably with the Dragon on. This is only my subjective impression because Task Manager tells me that Dragon does take 30-60% of CPU while in listening mode. The good news is that it's easy to turn the Mic off when Dragon is not needed and then Dragon's CPU usage drops to 3-4%.\n\nAnd there is no significant bad interaction with other apps that I'm aware of. I running the Dragon on a Windows 7, dual-CPU Thinkpad T40 and I haven't detected any 'new' problems following the Dragon installation.\n\nTHE DRAGON TRAINING/RIDING YOU\n\nThe Dragon does a lot to make itself useful and helpful. There is an optional sidebar that lists the most common commands available within the current context or you just say 'what can I say?' and the available commands show up, 'Help' pops up whenever you say 'give me Help', a brief tutorial with examples covers most activities, there is a Web site... and so on.\n\nWhile the above paragraph could have fit under the Dragon Riding section and it's true that many serious apps provide that kind of help, the Dragon is unique in its training its users into gradually modifying the way their minds work. It's a gradual process but the fact that the longer the spoken piece is - the Dragon tries to make sense of what you said whenever you 'pause' - the more accurate the Dragon is at guessing what your really meant to say. In other words, the Dragon is gently training you into speaking in complete, well-structured sentences.\n\nSpeaking for myself, being the fast touch typist that I am, I tend to type first and complete my thought later - because I can quickly erase/rephrase my text. This approach does not work well with the Dragon - it's possible to correct and modify a text but it's not efficient. Like I said, I am currently comfortable with using the Dragon for quick emails and messages but not for 'serious' documents. I do notice that my Dragon-dictation skills are improving and more of my soundbytes are complete sentences.\n\nMY RATING\n\nThe Dragon is one of the few pieces of computer software within this price range that does something useful and it does it intelligently. You can't have a conversation with the software the way you would with a typing clerk or a computer operator but, as the software evolves (I am reviewing Version 11) and as our little computers get faster and more capable, the Dragon seems to be very much on the path to that level of interactivity.\n\nThe way it is now, I will continue to use the Dragon. I don't expect for everybody to love it or 'like' it because it really depends. It does require some significant time investment to make it work well and... read the 'Dragon Riding You' section above. I personally like/love this software and, therefore, MY rating is a 5-star but, if I can recommend anything, it would be 'try it before you buy it'.\n\nP.S. - I did NOT test Dragon's interaction with sound files or digital voice recorders.\n\n--\n>> Brush your teeth, it's the law! <<", "summary": "Training Your Dragon", "unixReviewTime": 1287273600}

Not bad I thought. First impressions are important and the Windows 8 upgrade setup program didn't give a good first impression. It's more confusing that the older Win7 installer for experienced user. I couldn't tell if I could install on separate partition since the only options were erase everything or upgrade everything. Later I figured out you can get the more familiar win 7 installer where it lets you choose what partition to install on and let's you erase, create new partitions but only if you rerun the win8 setup program from the dvd and reboot! Anyways, I did a dual boot install just to play it safe and keep Win7 around if needed. After finishing the install ,which didn't really seem much faster than Win7, and actually I thought it locked up at one point but it was hard to tell with the new plain square logo which doesn't even pulsate anymore like Win7 did when you booted.\n\n  After the upgrade completed, I found out that my wireless didn't work. That's right even though it said my wireless was compatible it didn't work and I just got yellow exclamation next to it. I was about to give up but I figured I just try the trick I did when Vista first came out which is use another wireless usb stick to connect to the Internet and see if windows could find any drivers for it and sure enough that worked,so much for an improvement over Win7 in that regard.\n\n  The first time you log into Windows 8 it plays a video showing you how to use Windows by moving your mouse to the edges. I thought this is pretty bad that they have to show a video just so people can figure out how to use the new OS GUI! If you don't want to waste time fumbling around trying to figure out where everything went and disappeared to learning the Win+X shortcut is essential! Actually, this is the first Windows version where I've actually used the keyboard more than my mouse since some things now take too many steps i.e. like shutting down or are near impossible to do. I got stuck a couple of times in some of the new metro apps took over my entire screen and I wasn't able to quit or get back to the desktop! Tip: if this happens to you just hit the Windows key on your keyboard. If you really can't stand the new GUI you can recreate everything just like in Win7 for the most part and stay in the classic desktop instead of the new metro start screen. Only thing that still annoys me and don't know if there is way to fix it is how slow the start icon and everything else takes to come up when you move your mouse to a corner of the screen. I know it's only a fraction of a second but it's still noticeable and that's why I just use the Windows key now to switch between things! Also, the hotspots in the corners tend to get in the way more often than not.\n\n  All the programs and games I normally use in Windows 7 seem to work just fine in Windows 8. If it doesn't you can try right clicking to troubleshoot compatibility. My WEI score is the same in Win8 as it was in Win7 so seems no performance change according to that benchmark. Seems to be way more stable than Vista or even Win7 when it first came out. Haven't had a crash or even a pause in the GUI like I used to get with those when they first came out so that's a good sign.\n\n Another thing I didn't like is that there was like a 200MB update as soon as I first logged in and unlike Win7, Win8 rudely rebooted my computer in the middle of a browsing session and didn't warn me or give me option to postpone the reboot. At least on Mac OS X there is option to restore all your windows and browser to the way you had them, even after a reboot. Some of the things I do like about it so far is that you can now read pdf files without having to install acrobat just like mac os has always been able to, and IE now comes with Flash already built in. It's always annoying having to install all those basic programs.\n\n  I really like the new task manager, it gives you a lot more info than before and Microsoft now has something that even mac os does which is very cool and needed by people nowadays with bandwidth caps, metered connections. If your right click your wireless it'll tell you how much bandwidth you have used. Now that I think about it a lot of the new stuff in Win8 seems like it's copied directly from OS X. For example, there are no games included now and Microsoft basically forces you to get minesweeper and solitare from the app store now! The icons on the metro screen are just like a cross between the widgets in OS X dashboard and launchpad. It's looks like they also copied the Xbox GUI and brought it into windows.\n\n  Smartscreen, which caught me off guard first time I tried installing something, is Microsoft's version of Gatekeeper which does the same thing on OS X. So that is one of the new security features they added to Win8. Secure boot is another but I haven't messed with that.\n\n  Biggest disappointments, from a technical point of view, is that Win8 isn't 64bit only like we thought it would be a couple of years ago. Even Mac OS X is now fully 64-bit although that upset the people that couldn't upgrade their older Macs. Also, the Achilles heel of Windows, the registry, because it's too easy to corrupt and render Windows useless, is still there along with the winsxs problem. The WinSxs problem can grow out of hand and eat up all your disk space! I've been saying since XP ,why can't they include .net into windows instead of making you download it like Java? A couple of programs I tried to run said I needed the .net 2 or 3 mainly Steam games and so I had to download another 20-200MB file for that to work and you have to be connected to net to download it since there is no standalone version.\n\n  Another big letdown is that only the server version got the new filesystem ReFS, win8 only got storage spaces, which is more software raid. Microsoft has been promising a new improved filesystem several Windows versions back. I think the hardcore power users are going to have to accept the fact that the future of both Windows and Mac OS X is going to become and more geared to the iPod and Xbox crowd with their simplistic touch GUI and interface. This is also the group I'm guessing will have a more favorable view of the new GUI changes. I guess I'd probably be way more impressed if I had a touch capable PC since a lot of the new stuff seems to be geared towards that? I mean the command line is still there somewhere but it's hidden pretty good just like in OS X. Only thing I've really seen for geeks is something that macs and linux have been able to do for a long time already which is run the operating system from an external or usb stick, called windows to go but you need enterprise version for that.\n\n  As far as improvements in performance go, I haven't really seen any performance increases or disc space savings to warrant being in a rush to upgrade. My boot times are pretty much the same as with Win7 but then again I have an SSD drive , so Windows has already been pretty fast using that. In fact, the upgrade installer said I needed to free up at least 20GB of space min to even start the upgrade! Still no less than Win7 and XP only needs 10GB. Personally, I think I'll stick with Win8 it since I need to do a clean install on my SSD anyways since I have a whole bunch of old Windows 7 updates hogging up my SSD (the WinSXS problem I mentioned above) and haven't really had any major show stoppers so far like Vista or even Win7 when it first came out.\n\n  Finally, make sure you get the free media center upgrade while you can, otherwise you can't even play dvd's without installing powerdvd or some other program! I would've probably bumped my review up a start if it wasn't for Microsoft arbitrarily removing the start button so users are forced to use the new metro start screen whether you want to or not!\n\nUpdate:Actually, they did finally add a new option to disk cleanup that few will notice that addresses the WinSXS issue:\nThis is a MAJOR improvement over Windows 7, but I bet they only did it for Windows 8 because of all the ranting about WinSxS.\nThis is a fantastic news for SSD users!\n\n  You can find Disk Cleanup by typing:  WIN Key and start typing Disk Cleanup\n  Click the Disk Cleanup's \"Clean up System Files\" Button in the middle of the screen.\n  Check the box for Previous Windows Installation(s)\n  Click \"OK\" button and click the \"Delete\" Confirmation button.\nNow, only if they included a registry cleaner I'd give it 5 stars!", "summary": "First impressions", "unixReviewTime": 1353542400}

This software, which has been getting continually worse since 2002, couldn't have possibly improved since then ... ]\n\nFor me Quicken 2008 was a forced/hostage upgrade from Quicken 2005. You \"have\" to upgrade since they've cut a deal with the financial institutions to cut off your online access with the institutions if you don't upgrade every three years. Just as found when I was hostage upgraded in 2005 from 2002, there's nothing more than a cosmetic face-lift, no meaningful fixes/improvements -- but there's even more bugs, problems and aggravation.\n\n* Product now will not connect properly to Fidelity; no problem under 2005.\n\n* Took forever to figure out how to turn off a \"reminder\" function ... that kept reminding me to pay bills already scheduled to be paid using the auto-pay function. 2005 did the same thing and it's not been fixed.\n\n*You can turn off the product registration nag screen ... if you Google to find out how. Product does not have to be registered to use it.\n\n* Un-reconciles accounts six months back every once in a while. I've been assuming that's being caused by a few bytes of bad data that occasionally comes from the financial institutions ... that the Quicken people have not properly coded so as to filter out. This bug also surfaced in 2005. Two weeks into 2008, I've seen it again already.\n\n* You can't turn off the \"free update/revision\" nag screen unless you take the update. No such nag screen in 2005.\n\n* When connecting, the completion screen used to show which accounts had new transactions to match and had convenient buttons next to each to take you directly to the account. Gone in 2008. Now I have to look through every account each time to see where transactions might have been retrieved.\n\n* Icons everywhere attempting to peddle other unwanted Quicken products. One of the 'product improvements' in 2008.\n\n* Doesn't handle stock distributions correctly (since they were not actually paid for); keeps generating error messages when you enter the correct posting of no cost incurred. Same problem in 2005.\n\n* Tricky screens/checkboxes/prompts that try to bait you into using/enrolling for QuickenDot services when you don't have to or need to. Users that did so now post complaints they can't undo it and that the QuickenDot server is constantly down, causing problems/delays when trying to connect to other accounts using a one-step update.\n\nYet another company that's grown totally complacent about product quality while wallowing in its assured-for-the-moment revenue stream. It will bite them hard in the long-run. Postings indicate similar complaining regarding the major competitor product, Microsoft Money. If history is any lesson, there's no reason to suspect that these software products will ever get better under these conditions. Some other product will have to steal their customer base before they wake up and smell the coffee.\n\nIf you are not already committed to either of those two products, take a good long look at open source software such as GNU Cash.\n\n[Update: April 15, 2008] Does now connect to Fidelity ... occasionally. When I opened the portfolio area today, the entire computer screen flashed with confusion and the product crashed. 2005 never once crashed. Still flashing but no subsequent crashes. Who knows what happened. Not me. Apparently not Quicken programmers either.\n\n[Update: July 12, 2008] Connects to Fidelity now more or less on regular basis. Software still flashes/flickers routinely. Also slow to load, apparently trying to read every single record into RAM, regardless of age. Pop-up screen this morning stating \"We've noticed you are not downloading your current Quicken Visa/MasterCard transactions, click here to ...\" I don't have one. Obviously a deceptive come-on intended to trick users into the application process for a Quicken credit card. Nice. Still constantly beg-screens me to take the latest software update.\n\n[Update: October 18, 2008] Just downloaded this week's financial transactions and Quicken wiped out four months of reconciliation on one of my credit cards ... again.\n\n[Update: January 10, 2009] Tried to change the amount of an annual repeating payment. Refused to accept the change with the error message \"You must make this change and sign on no later than six days before scheduled payment.\" Payment was set for April 4, 2009, almost three months in the future. I had to delete the payment, log on to make the deletion take effect, then enter the payment all over again for the new amount, then log on again to make that payment take effect. And when I tried to log on I rec'd an error message stating an Internet connection was not detected (a message I get rather often despite my always-on broadband). Luckily I can choose the \"Ignore\" button and it will go ahead and connect. Quicken programming staff = worthless carpetbaggers.\n\n[Update: March 5, 2009] Wanted to stop an ongoing monthly repeating payment where the next scheduled payment was already in place in my register for March 27. I edited in a change for \"how many times\" from \"unlimited\" to \"1.\" In other words, I wanted to pay on March 27 for the last time. When I logged on to the bank the first time, Quicken canceled the March 27 payment.  Now doesn't that take the cake--Quicken accounting/finance software programmers are unable to count up to one. And, as all too often anymore, the screen went wacko while I was logging onto the bank.\n\n[Update: March 8, 2009] Quicken just UNreconciled one of my credit cards (again) back to the October, 2008 close. Luckily, its a card I don't use much. I suppose this has something to do with Quicken software coders not understanding the start of Daylight Savings Time.\n\n[Update: March 27, 2009] The repeating payment change I referred to at March 5, 2009? The saga continues. When I tried to enter the NEW repeating payment, it wouldn't take. I entered it, connected to the bank and nothing happened. The payment did not show in the list of repeating payments or in the register. I tried deleting the payee entirely to start over, but Quicken wouldn't/won't let me delete that payee at all. It claims it cannot be deleted because there is a repeating payment in effect ... that would be the payment that is ALREADY canceled. Which means I can't cancel it so I can't delete the payee. To set up the new payment I ended up having to create an entire new payee to make the new payment 'take.' I had to put a dash in the middle of the account number to create the new payee since Quicken won't allow two repeating payments with the exact same account number. And I am still stuck with the old payee on file which I cannot delete at all. I had to call the bank twice just to make sure the durn payment is actually going to be made on time ... and made only once ... and for the correct amount. You would think there would be a way to force deletion of a payee. Then again YOU are thinking, Quicken programmers on the other hand are off somewhere slurping down a latte.\n\n[Update: April 2, 2009] Have an established monthly recurring payment of $[...] and would like to change it to $[...]. Enter the Online Center, click on Repeating. There it is. Click on it then select Edit. Change the amount from $[...] to $[...]. Save the change. Seems simple enough. Log on to the bank. Result: (1) Quicken cancels the next pending payment, on April 19, of $[...]. So far so good. (2) Quicken enters a pending payment into the checkbook register for $[...] dated May 19. Huh? What happened to my April payment? God only knows what will happen if I tinker with this recurring payment any further. I will write a paper check for one month ... and hope for the best. A[...]\n\n[Update: July 14, 2009] Quicken is popping up a screen telling me I am overdue on a July 10 payment to a vendor for $[...]. The register shows the payment was made and cleared on July 10. And it's reminding me to schedule another future payment ... that's already scheduled. It's the same durn thing I was talking about in bullet # 2 at the top of the review, apparently it's a zombie bug that has now risen from the dead. Still begs me to take the Quicken software update constantly.\n\n[Update: September 15, 2009] Quicken has suddenly started reminding me ... once again ... that certain bills are overdue, even though they've already been paid using the automatic monthly payment function. It asks me if I want to delete, pay or skip. I can only guess what havoc might occur if I delete or skip ... so I just keep waiting for the nag screen to eventually go away.\n\nWhen Quicken goes under, I'm going to wear a pink tuxedo to the funeral.\n\nNOTE: I have posted a copy of this review under \"Quicken 2010 Deluxe\" and I will add any further comments and updates to that post.]", "summary": "Buggy as cr@p, unless previously committed to Quicken, look closely at open source such as GNU Cash ...", "unixReviewTime": 1227916800}

First of all, this is the first Nancy Drew game to take place somewhere outside of the continental United States, which deserves recognition in and of itself (yes - Nancy's FINALLY going out of the country to solve a case!). Secondly, Nancy's suspect list has always before been equally populated by men and women, or has had two or three men to one woman. For the first time, Nancy has a case with mostly female suspects (three females and one male). I found this very interesting, and nicely thought through. Thirdly, this is one of the most challenging and frightening Nancy Drew titles, and was advertised as the most so when it was released.\n\nNot only is the game revolutionary, but it's also awesome. The storyline is very intense, and the history surrounding Blackmoor Manor is so richly detailed. It's amazing to see how much thought must've gone into this game, and I imagine it took more effort from the creators than ever before.\n\nA young woman named Linda has recently married Hugh Penvellyn, a wealthy British diplomat, and has gone over to start a new life with him and his stepdaughter in England. They live together in Blackmoor Manor, where the Penvellyns have lived for hundreds of years. However, shortly after she moves in, Linda begins to feel sickly and starts behaving bizarrely. She throws fits, hides behind a bed curtain all day, and refuses to eat healthy food. Nobody knows what's caused this change in her, and in a fit of desperation, her mom (who still lives in America) calls Nancy to ask her if she could fly out to England to find out what's happening to Linda.\n\nOnce she arrives in Blackmoor Manor, Nancy hears a sinister-sounding creature call out her name. When she looks around, she sees a pair of glowing eyes staring at her. Mrs. Drake, an elderly woman who's been taking care of the manor, answers the door, but not before the creature leaves. Mrs. Drake seems skeptical of what Nancy claims to have seen, but that doesn't stop Nancy from investigating. She soon discovers that one of the Penvellyns to own Blackmoor Manor was burned at the stake for witchcraft hundreds of years ago, and a beast she's rumored to have created had been prowling the moors for years. Could this beast have now returned? And why? And what (if anything) does it have to do with Linda? The answers to all these questions and more can only be found by solving this case...\n\nThis is probably one of the most unique plots in the Nancy Drew series.  This is the first time when she's not called in to investigate high-profile crimes, like murder, threats, vandalism, kidnapping, theft, and the like. \"Curse of Blackmoor Manor\" is also the first game to feature a family struggle that's turned into a mystery that Nancy is now called to solve. I enjoyed this plot quite a bit, and felt it was quite refreshing.\n\nBlackmoor Manor is beautifully detailed. The graphics used in this game are superb, and even though it was released way back in 2005, the gaming quality and graphics still rival many games today. I really can't complain about the graphics, save for the fact that Jane's appearance might seem a tiny bit disproportional (but she's also young, short, and sitting down on a bed, which is hard to animate).\n\nThis game featured A LOT of puzzles, but they were all very well-explained and served a purpose for being there. I liked them all, and even though others might complain, I personally cannot. I also liked exploring the manor, which is rather large and has many places and things to see. My sole complaint is that at least half of the exploration takes place in the secret passageways, and I would've liked to see more of the \"outer surface\" of Blackmoor Manor.\n\nThere were also lots of fun mini games to play, so the player can find something else fun to do in the game if they're bored with solving puzzles and want to take a break from the mystery. The character Jane has several games that Nancy can play with her. All of them have to be played at least once to progress the game in some way, but they can all be played again as much as the player wants to (Jane's always up for play!).\n\nAll of the characters were very well-developed, and all had reason for being at the manor while Nancy was staying there. They also all had something to benefit by causing the haunting and horror surrounding Blackmoor Manor, and for terrorizing poor Linda. The first suspect met is Mrs. Drake, Hugh's aunt with a self-righteous attitude and believes the British to be superior to the Americans in every way. Nigel Mookerjee is a historian who's been hired by Mrs. Drake to write a book on the Penvellyns, and is looking for something in the family history to \"spice things up\" for his book. Jane Penvellyn is Hugh's 12-year-old daughter who's been forced to return to the manor after living in the United States for awhile, and seems to miss her biological mother very much. Ethel Bosinny is Jane's private tutor who only appears every so often, and is very elusive and mysterious in the sense that she never seems to be found in the same place twice (nor can when she'll appear be predicted).\n\nThe other characters and phone friends are all pretty nicely integrated too. I absolutely loved the fact that Nancy can call Ned again (as he hadn't appeared in a game since \"The Final Scene\"), and the new method of getting hints that this game employed was very unique and fun. Rather than getting her hints from her phone friends, Nancy consults with Loulou, an 80-year-old female parrot who's residing in the manor. Loulou is very smart, and has quite a lot of funny comments to make about the case and everything involved. She's very well-scripted, and I loved talking to her because of how much comedic relief she added to the game.\n\nAll and all, the characters were great. I honestly didn't know who the culprit would be for sure until the end, but I did have my greatest suspicion leaning toward one particular person. This hunch was correct, but I was glad about that, as it employed two moves that needed to be done in culprit selection (one that'd never been done before, and one that was rarely done before). I won't say anything further, as I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't played...\n\n\"Curse of Blackmoor Manor\" had a great musical score. I liked the traditional British feel of the music, and it definitely suited the location of the mystery. Every now and then, it also got more eerie, which also added to the overall fright factor.\n\nAfter being voted into the top three overall games, \"Curse of Blackmoor Manor\" was released in the Collector's Edition Fan Favorites pack with \"Treasure in the Royal Tower\" and \"The Secret of Shadow Ranch\". Did it earn its spot there? For sure! This game brought a true revolution to the Nancy Drew games, and remains one of the best even to this date. I've been playing this game for years, and I still jump a bit whenever I see phantoms and monsters creeping about the manor, watch clips of nightmares that Nancy has, or Ethel pops up in the middle of the night. It's a fun fright that's perfect for those who're willing to face their fears and solve one of the most terrifying cases that adventure gaming has ever known!", "summary": "Only the Fearless Dare Walk These Halls...", "unixReviewTime": 1310515200}

And getting technical support from QuickBooks is almost impossible. But QuickBooks always found a way to force the upgrade and I had to upgrade from QuickBooks Pro 2006 to QuickBooks Pro 2009 because they  stopped downloading the bank transactions.

For most people, QuickBooks 2012 Pro version should be good enough and most cost effective, it works with QuickBooks payroll. Features of Premier version like creating business plan, consolidating reports from multiple company files, finding and locating inventory tasks etc. are not useful and worth extra money to me.\n\nWhen it comes to business accounting software with the ability to do payroll, QuickBooks is pretty much the only game in town. Unfortunately QuickBooks Mac version is not as robust and lacks many of the features of Windows version.\n\nFor most people, QuickBooks Pro version should work and provide most buck for the bang.

I really didn't quite understand enough ABOUT the program to really set any options, so I thought I'd just start the program.\nI was forced to watch a movie on posture and fingering.  I suppose if I'd known better I could have turned it off in options, but I'm not the type to study a program before I use it.  I just want it to work- intuitively would be nice.\nI'm impatient, and felt like I lost time out of my life I'd never get back suffering through those movies that are slow, plus Mavis just talks so slow.  Only beginning typists might need this.  I'm already a proficient typist, but I'd love to type 110wpm.\nThe skills assessment test was easy enough, though it took off points for an old timer like me that double spaced between sentences.

It would be really nice if the program had done this FOR me.  It is software and software is all about automation first, rich media second in my mind.\nI couldn't find the options menu.  It's not on the main screen that you use most.  I clicked everything, I stopped and restarted the program- how ANNOYING.

It's worth time to spend a lot of time in PREFERENCES if you are somewhat proficient and simply want to increase your speed.\nIt still took me to lesson 1, home row.\nIs it too much to ask that I be able to choose the lessons that I want to do?

The disk is a genuine Microsoft disk.  I called Microsoft tech support and asked what is a \"hybrid.\"  Below is a link to what the Professional 2007 hybrid was.  Tech Support said \"hybrid\" was a download and not a disk.  It did activate and I do have a product key.  The Tech thought I may be okay. Until the program started to reinstall every time I opened it, I had no idea that this was a hybrid version and the sealed package doesn't disclose this fact.  I fixed the reinstall problem by entering \"regedit\" in the search box (under the start button in Windows 7), right clicked to run it as Administrator, under HKEY_Current_User, Software,Microsoft, Office, 12.0, then clicked on the individual programs (e.g., Word), right clicked in the blank area to the right for \"new\", then selected DWord, renamed it \"NoReReg\", then modified the value from \"0\" to \"1\".  This took care of the Windows Installer trying to reinstall these programs every time I started using them for that day.  Now I have my fingers crossed that all is well with this Microsoft Office Professional 2007 Full Version.  Most of the businesses in our area still use 2007 and 2010, so I wanted to learn those systems; otherwise, if it were just for my personal and home business use, I'd probably go with 2013 or 365.  Buying older software from resellers is still a risky business.  Hope this info helps.  UPDATE:  My seller hadn't heard of a \"hybrid\" version either but he offered to refund my money.  So far, it's working.  I set the computer clock ahead 90 days to see if I could trigger it to stop working but the program continued to work.

Then I started the program and it loaded... and loaded.... and loaded.  It took several seconds for it to finally come up to a screen where I could do something.  While startup was very slow, I was satisfied with how the program ran from that point forward.  It appears that a lot of stuff has to load to get it started but when it is done it works fine.  The only problem I had with the program was that it hung on two occassions.  Unfortunately, it hung the system so bad that I could not even use control-alt-delete to get access to shut it down.  Nothing responded.  The second time it happened I pulled my USB drive out before powering it down and the system returned control to me!  I don't know the source of the problem but after some testing I could get it to hang consistently when the SanDisk USB drive with U3 was in the computer.  It did not do it with my Toshiba without U3.  So, maybe it is a U3 thing, maybe a SanDISK thing, or maybe the combination.\n\nThe first thing to note in the program is the very intuitive user interface.  The more advanced a program is the more cluttered the interface tends to become.  However, this Suite was fairly uncluttered given it's advanced abilities.  This is not to say there is no learning curve because there is one, but it was not as steep as I had expected.\n\nThis Suite includes CorelDraw, Photo-Paint, PowerTRACE, CAPTURE, Font Navigator and a few other utilities.  The two components that impressed me the most were CorelDraw and PowerTRACE.  The CorelDraw application competes well with Adobe Illustrator at a considerably lower cost.  It has the ability to do very advanced illustrations with multiple layers and  multiple pages.  It does a good job of page layout and allows different layers on different pages as well as master layers that are consistent across all pages.  Many professionally designed templates come with the system but it could use more.  The problem is that many of the templates are not much more than basic variations of a similar theme.  On the other hand it comes with a huge set of royalty-free photos, clip art, and fonts.  It even includes a large book of the available fonts that you can browse through to select the right one.\n\nWith strong import and export functions it can import over 100 different formats including pdf.  They have also included a link to the WhatTheFont Web site.  If you are trying to identify a font in a publication or graphic file you can copy an example and paste it into the web site.  The web site then tries to identify the font.  This is nice to have available with a simple click instead of having to open a browser, enter the web site address, etc.  CorelDraw also has an excellent preview function and live-editing that allows you to drag an image and see immediately how the text flows around it as you move it.\n\nThe other standout in the package is the PowerTRACE program for converting bitmap images to vector graphics.  I tried several logos and basic graphics with various levels of quality and found it to work very well.  Some of the conversions were not perfect but were easy enough to clean up to a really superb end product.  This was a really impressive product that performed better than expected.\n\nThe Photo-Paint product is a bitmap-editing program that has very few features that make it standout from other similar programs.  It is a solid intermediate to professional level product that does not have all the features of the high-end products but has much more than many other products.  One of the things it does really well is the support for the RAW camera format.  Other than the vendor's viewing program, this is the only program I have that supports the RAW format for my camera.  Interactive histograms also works well and lets you preview image adjustments.\n\nIn summary, I would highly recommend this program because it is priced as a middle level product but supplies programs that are at the upper end of the quality scale (CorelDraw) or upper middle level (Photo-Paint) and then throws in a great utility for those times when you need to convert a bitmap logo into a vector graphic.  It is worth the price for the CorelDraw alone so it is a great deal to have the other products added as part of it.  A great product with sufficiently high quality features that I can overlook the slow startup, and highly recommend it to anyone.", "summary": "Great program, versatile, competitively priced", "unixReviewTime": 1213315200}

Is Trend Micro 100% responsible for those results?  Probably not, as I would like that think that my common sense caution plays some role in my lack of drama.  But I'll give them credit for at least 75% of my success.\n\nEven moderately cautious users will occasionally click on the wrong link, and it's comforting to see Trend Micro step between you and a suspicious web site from time to time.  Note to those that might see this little intervention on a regular basis, you just might want to rethink what you want out of the internet (genuine information and entertainment, or ????).\n\nSo, no virus infections within the past year.  No Trojan attacks, and everything appears to be safe and secure.  This is good!\n\nBesides the basics, there are two features that I appreciate most, the System Tuner and the Trend Micro Vault.  My Vista-running PC has always been slow to boot and vulnerable to lags caused by resident software like security programs.  But what good does a security program do for you if it causes everything else to run more slowly? Internet Security Pro 3.0 doesn't create that problem.  And the System Tuner helps you tweak your resident software and file sizes to make that even less a problem.\n\nI've had problems with other security programs in the past (Microsoft, Norton and McAfee), but this has been the most trouble-free package for me by far.  Installation was simple and quick, registration went off without a hitch and my system performance is clearly better.\n\nAnd what about the System Vault?  Consider it your last-ditch defense.  If someone manages to walk off with your notebook, System Vault won't let them into the files that you least want shared.

Instead, use the individual tools or tool groups.\n--> Make changes incrementally. Reboot after making a change & re-analyze for recommendations. Evaluate.\n--> Before you make a change, do some research and understand a bit about what the change/fix is. Just because a program suggests a change/fix, doesn't mean that you should make it.\n--> SM Standard is probably sufficient. I've previously owned SM Pro and never used the additional features. However, SM Pro is non-subscription pricing but SM Standard is yearly subscription (at least as of the last I checked).\n--> Price the SM 3-PC license versions. I've found this to be one of the best values -- only problem, the clock on all the licenses starts ticking on the first install & activation.\n\nThat said, SM is a great all-in-one maintenance utility -- it's a worthwhile investment in your computer, and it just might improve your knowledge about PCs.

I wanted it to look like the eyes were following a fly that ultimately lands on its face--but the sunflower seed I took from a bag of birdseed really looks more like a nose than a fly so I decided not to spend the time adding audio right now.\n\nI'm very impressed with all the stuff this software can do.  I can add voice-overs or background music, capture frames from a pc cam, digital camera, camcorder, or images files from my hard drive. As an artist I can't wait to try their image editor which allows me to enhance, draw, paint or add text to any of the frames.  With more time I could change that sunflower seed into a fly!  The one feature I'm most interested in right now is the blue/green screen swap feature that will allow me to change the background!\n\nBottom line:  Highly recommended for creative individuals of all ages!\n\nP.S.

Toast 7 makes perfect CDs every time.  I literally have NOT ended up with a \"coaster\" since about three computers ago, over 10 years ago.  I do use good blanks, but every blank I have tried has burned perfectly.\n\n4.  With Toast 7 you can EASILY change the space between tracks from 0 to 8 seconds.  Zero seconds between tracks is essential for concept albums... Everything from Pink Floyd's the Wall to Disney's Alice In Wonderland Soundtrack, plus Classical Symphonies and Piano Concertos, and a few Tomita CDs, etc...\n\n5.

Snow Leopard is Lean and Powerful and able to run many older programs that the newer Mac Operating Systems cannot run. When I am required to install Mavericks to sync my new iPhone 5, I am going to partition a new hard drive to boot from both Snow Leopard AND Mavericks.

My motivation for getting this product was to learn how to make an animation - to see what was involved in the process and see how well I could do. As you can see by the wide variety of stars given by reviewers, there are all sorts of opinions about this product. Some say it is easy, some say it is not easy at all, some say it is too limited, etc.\n\nWell from the standpoint of an absolute beginner, I have to say I really could not expect that much from a product that wasn't intended to have a whole bunch of pro features in it. It has a good set of functions, and they are not that difficult to learn. The videos and tutorials are very helpful; I find that you just have to pay attention and think about what you are doing. It does help if you have previously used graphics software and are familiar with basic concepts, such as layering.\n\nI especially like having a character wizard, and also the bone-rigging toolset that makes it so much easier and faster to compose an animation. I am terrible at drawing and also quite impatient so I appreciate having this, and being able to use decent-looking characters instead of ones I would have to draw myself (although that option is certainly available).\n\nI would say for most people who mainly want to put together a decent animation that is not intended for professional use, this software is great. If you are looking for a bunch of more complex or powerful features, you'll have to spend the money to get those; the price of this product reflects the fact that you are not going to get anything really fancy but you do get a lot for your money. It's a lot of fun and the time taken to learn how to use the program will be rewarded with something tangible - the animation, and something intangible as well - the satisfaction of having learned the process and being successful.", "summary": "Decent product with basic functions", "unixReviewTime": 1336953600}

I've used various versions of Office for Windows, OpenOffice.org, and Office 2004/2008 for Mac, as well as iWork 06 and iWork 08. I prefer iWork 08 the best, and while Office 2008 is pretty nice, there are some issues I have with it which keep it from being my product of choice.\n\n*Performance: Office programs typically take a few seconds longer to open than iWork programs do. It takes up more ram and makes the whole computer run more slowly than an iWork program does.\n\n*Cost: What is Microsoft thinking? Charging hundreds of dollars for productivity programs (depending on the version), when OpenOffice.org (however ugly-looking and special-feature-lacking it is) is free, and when iWork, a superior product, is well under a hundred dollars.\n\n*Size: The size of all the programs and files in Office 2008 Home & Student is over 900 mb, bigger than it needs to be. iWork+iCal+Mail is less than 700 mb. And Office also has tons of visible files in the Office folder, all of which are executable and pose potential security risks.\n\n*Compatibility: Here's a funny one. I opened a Word document I made in Office 2003 (for Windows, .doc format) in both Pages (from iWork) and Word (from Office). The formatting (paragraph size, margins, etc.) was nearly identical to the original when viewed in Pages, but when viewed in Word 2008, formatting was different! This isn't always the case, though. There was a document I made in Office 2007 (.docx) and formatting was closer to the original when viewed in Office 2008 than when viewed in Pages. But still, Microsoft made Office 2003 and Office 2008, and you'd think they would know how to keep formatting the same better than Apple.\n\n*A bad copy. True to Microsoft's past, they just copied features found in iWork 08 and mushed them into Office 2008, only they didn't do a good job. Like 3D slide transitions really look 3D in Keynote, but they are almost a joke in Office. Or the thing in PowerPoint to help position graphics: it doesn't work with as many items as it does in Keynote. Or controlling PowerPoint with the Apple Remote doesn't work as well, and you can't start a presentation with the remote either.\n\n*Not intuitive. Toolbars are a thing of the past, and you have to keep a side window open for formatting and such. However, if you're viewing the formatting for, say, a chart, you will have no access to basic font formatting at that time.", "summary": "Pretty features, bad product.

Coming from a more robust version of Norton's anti-virus software to this version has proved an easy transition though not one without hiccups.\n\n--------------------\nINSTALLATION:\n\nI received the physical disk format, however, after installing the disk and starting the installation wizard the recommended method was internet download... go figure. So I went along with that route and very quickly >15min downloaded and proceeded installing my software. Strangely the first time I entered my authentication code Norton's site indicated that my code had been previously used. I tried the code again about 20 minutes later and it worked. I should mention that if you have any anti-virus software already installed you should go ahead and uninstall it anyway as Norton will prompt you to do so.\n\nNote that you will be prompted to create an account Norton/Symantec during installation.\n\n--------------------\nUSE:\n\nThe Internet Security user interface (UI) is very familiar to me. It is basically populated with some easy to identify tiles: 'Secure' (color coded to indicate threats on your machine; green = good; 'Scan Now' which brings up a sub-menu for all types of system security scans; 'Live Update' for downloading the latest security definitions and patches; 'Advanced' for configuration. The tiles also display pertinent information including CPU usage (monitoring for spikes which are an indicator of a potential rogue application) and even when the latest definitions were downloaded and installed. The UI is good, easy to navigate, and unobtrusive.\n\nI have this software installed on 3 machines - my primary desktop that has a SSD, 4-disc RAID storage array, and a networked NAS; along with two laptops all running Windows 7. I've found that Norton has done a great job on each system. Scan times vary, however, on my 300Gb SSD a full scan takes approximately 40-minutes for reference.\n\nAs I was already and have continuously used anti-virus software I didn't find any surprises on my systems after running my initial post-installation scans.\n\n--------------------\nUSAGE NOTES:\n\nIt's perhaps just my impression but it seems that software companies tend to treat their customers a bit poorly on licensing. Norton is no exception. This software is licensed to you, you don't \"own\" it rather than lease a window of operation. That's fine and something that we've all sort of become accustomed to, however, the major problem is that this software will stop operating completely once it's 365 day operating license (the day you activate the key) is up. Prior to 2010 (as far as I can remember) Norton software would at least keep functioning outside of the subscription period though obviously not getting new updates and definitions.\n\nThe bottom line, and this is true for a lot of software and particularly anti-virus software is that you're going to have a costly bill due every year whether from Norton, Trend Micro, McAfee or whatever security company. You can mitigate this somewhat by buying last years anti-virus product. As long as the activation code hasn't been used you should be good to go. Remember that your license period doesn't start on the calendar year but only after the key is activated.\n\n--------------------\nISSUES:\n\nI don't usually install a lot of extensions in my browser but for some reason went ahead with Norton's Internet Security extension. This was a mistake! I'm a Chrome user and noticed that my browser immediately become slower, and prone to frequent crashes that killed every open tab. I had nothing but issues with the browser extension so I do not recommend using it, especially if you're a Chrome user!\n\n--------------------\nCONCLUSION:\n\nNorton delivers another solid release of their seminal anti-virus software. Performance is good, obtrusiveness is kept at a relative minimum. Be wary of renewing online through Norton as you'll always pay top-dollar.

No grammar, syntax, or conjugation!\n\nI really want to say, I'm very excited by this product. I've always been intrigued by the possibility of learning Chinese, but each time I looked into the options, I quickly gave up. The other books and tapes I've looked at are difficult and \"flat\", as in uni-dimensional. You either repeat what's on the tape ad nauseum, or read what's in the book ad nauseum, you get the idea.\n\nThe Rosetta Stone Chinese program is very different. It's multi-dimensional in the sense that it gives you several ways to learn. You can use the computer-based tools to speak and get instantaneous feedback. You can use the Audio Companion CDs in your car (actually, on my iPod!) to practice while driving or whatever. Within the computer based tools are several ways to learn, including a cool Milestones test that inserts you into a real life situation where you have to speak the right answer. I was actually intimidated to try this for a few hours, because I didn't want to screw up, but eventually I tried it, screwed up, and learned more by doing so.\n\nI really like the Rosetta method of presenting you with visual images and spoken language for you to repeat, then visual \"puzzles\" for you to deduce the correct response. This is very natural once you get into it. It took me a while to get the \"rhythm\" and patterns of the language, but this method in particular helped me over that hump. That's the main reason for my 5 star rating. I couldn't get that from a \"flat\" book or tape series.\n\nThis set includes everything, including the computer headset and  microphone, so you just drop it all in and go. It worked flawlessly on my vintage 2006 Windows XP laptop.\n\nImportant: You are going to have to set aside time to learn Chinese with this or any other system. Five minutes here and there won't work. The program is broken up into lots of modules, so it is easy to focus on a small amount of related material at once, but FOCUS is the issue: I recommend 30-90 minutes at a time with no distractions (audio or visual!).\n\nThe downside: I don't think I'm  going to become fluent reading or writing Chinese from this system. I didn't expect to be able to read written Chinese, so I did not reduce my review for this limitation. Perhaps others will have more luck, because the features are there to help you read two kinds of Chinese writing, but I don't think that part is going to make me literate. I can recognize some Chinese characters at this point, but there are thousands you have to know to be literate.\n\nBy the way, if you want to get a taste of the Rosetta Stone method, go to their web site where they have an online sample of the watch-listen-try system (for Turkish!).

I've never been disappointed with the products or their service, and this AutoCAD Revit LT Suite 2013 is no exception.\n\nI installed this on a MacBook Pro 17\" with 8GB of RAM (the max allowed), and right out of the box was amazed at the lightning speed the program handled calculations, recalculations, and rendering. Whether your used to the more traditional tools of the AutoCAD LT, or more robust 3D programs, you are going to be VERY pleased with the ease at which you can harness both approaches to your work, without any tradeoff in productivity.  Besides the speed, and ease of use, one of my favorite features is the ability to add copious annotations to everything as you build.  If you share your files with collaborators (you can share files in the DWG format), the ability to annotate everything will save hours in eliminating the mistakes that are caused by guesswork.\n\nAdditionally, and no small feature, is the 1-year Autodesk and AutoCAD LT 2013 subscription, which gives you access to share your files seamlessly via the Autodesk cloud with collaborators--even those who are using other software that operates on the Revit platform. It's pretty amazing. This is an extremely handy feature because not only can you estimate costs in collaboration with others, but you can also generate schedules that are available immediately to everyone concerned, and keep everyone on track.\n\nThis program contains all and more of what you expect in a CAD program, and are too extensive to outline here.  Go to the Autodesk website to read about all the features.  My take on this package is that it's intuitive, extremely functional with a sleek user interface, and gives you the design and planning power normally found in only high-end packages.\n\nI would highly recommend this program for everyone from those who build sets for theater productions, to those who are planning the next city hall for their town.  It's great for both start-up and seasoned professional, and back by the class act know as Autodesk.

Back in July 2009 my first wife was killed in a car wreck (not her fault, someone in a much bigger vehicle literaly ran over her vehicle as she tried to make a left turn across the road).  After that tragic accident I was inspired to do some estate planning of my own and I've been on a quest ever since to try to be as prepared as possible for my family's sake.  I snagged an earlier version of this product and went through the process of answering the interview type questions as to what I wanted for my family, who should handle what roles after my death, who should get specific bequeaths, etc.  A very simple and fairly painless process.  Really the worst of it was having to think through in advance who would need the most support and who should handle the important roles if you pass away.\n\nA few short years later, just a few weeks ago, my youngest brother met his own end thanks to another tragic accident.  (Fell off a roof/ladder, into a large wooden object he was working on, fractured his skull.)  Thankfully, he was a man of deep faith, as was his wife and family, and given the fact that his last project was one of trying to put a steeple on a church, it's a safe assumption that he died doing something that he could truly feel good about.  Because of prior service (military and police) he had the foresight to have made up a will that his widow was able to use to handle his arrangements after his death, so even though it's been an emotionally trying time for her, she has had the comfort of her faith and the benefit of his good planning to help get her through it all with a roadmap he had made up well in advance.\n\nWills and estate planning aren't fun topics, at least not for most people, and yet they are vitally important things to do in life.  Quicken WillMaker Plus helps to make the process easier, which in turn helps to get users to GET IT DONE.  The software is very reasonably priced and for *most* potential users, it is really all they would need.  Even if you may have a more complex estate to deal with, by using WillMaker Plus you can get a good start on everything you should do and think of doing to handle your estate planning.\n\nVERY highly recommended.", "summary": "While I hope to never need this for myself...", "unixReviewTime": 1324512000}

And, speaking as an unhappy employee forced to use WordPerfect back in the Dark Ages, I can attest to the improvements that Corel has made in this suite of Office applications.  Here are a few of the pros and cons of this program as I've experienced them:\n\nPROS:\n\nWordPerfect X4 is easy to use, and it is easier to manage my blog with text from WordPerfect than with text written in Word 2007.\n\nSame with Quattro X4 - easy to use, fast-running.  No complaints here.\n\nWordPerfect Office X4 comes with a tutorial video that shows you how to do all manner of interesting things with your office suite.  I've only completed half of it, and I've already learned some new time-saving tricks.\n\nI've used the PDF maker to great advantage, and I'm very pleased with the results. I also appreciate not having to buy Adobe Acrobat yet again.\n\nCONS:\n\nWordPerfect is designed to work with documents from every conceivable word processor.  Ahem - isn't that a bit of overkill, or could it perhaps be managed during program installation so that my computer doesn't have to host such a big program?\n\nWordPerfect Lightning was a big problem for me.  It did not work and play well with the rest of the programs on my computer.  I finally uninstalled it because it popped up unexpectedly and interfered with my ongoing work.\n\nI have yet to try the month's free trial of Corel's Visual Intelligence, but I can report that it is a subscription-based service.  Every year you get to pay again, and, somehow, that rubs me the wrong way.  I'll buy a program (I know, I know, I'm only leasing it), but I don't want to buy the same program over and over every year.  So I consider this feature, which may in fact be very good, to be a pain.\n\nOverall, I find more pros than cons with WordPerfect Office X4.  It's not perfect, but, as a regular user for two months, I've found that it meets my needs most of the time.

It wasn't always this way, as those who have been computer users for some years will remember well. In fact, we may have all been running WordPerfect Office with its affiliated programs if it wasn't for some strange twists in computer history beginning in the 1990s.\n\nThere are a number of variants of this Office suite that can be found for sale here, but this review is specifically focused on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Office-Professional-2013-Key-Card-1PC-1User/dp/B009SPL2K0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Office Professional 2013 Key Card 1PC/1User</a>&nbsp;version. This version is activated from the Internet by entering a product key card, and is licensed for one user on one PC. It offers the current versions of Microsoft's Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, OneNote, Access, and Publisher applications.\n\nPlease note: I had previously installed the more basic&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Office-Home-Business-2013-Key-Card-1PC-1User/dp/B009SPWJ98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Office Home & Business 2013 Key Card 1PC/1User</a>&nbsp;version on a Window 7 PC notebook, and that version had worked quite well. This Office Professional 2013 version was for installation on a PC that had been upgraded to Windows 8.1, so it was initially more of an experiment than anything. Here are the highly-subjective likes and dislikes found so far with this installation of the new Office Professional 2013 suite for those looking for just the key points, then followed with some expanded details.\n\n Likes:\n\n+ Very smooth installation; simple directions, easy to follow, almost effortless\n+ Clean interface; smooth and minimalist, ribbon can be collapsed as needed\n+ Excellent Outlook integration; works well with Outlook.com, Gmail and private email\n+ SkyDrive; allows for access of files on the cloud, file sharing when needed\n+ Easy customization once installed; make it work your way\n\n Rants & Irritants:\n\n- Full ALL CAPS menu tabs; don't like having the Metro-style jammed down my throat\n\n Installation:\n\nThe setup is simple and easy to follow. Included in the small box are the directions and a 25-character Product Key card. Go to the Microsoft Office site as indicated, enter the characters from the card as noted, then sign into or create your Microsoft account. Users who already have an Outlook account (possibly converted over from Hotmail) can start with that. Then it's a simple scenario of following the on-screen directions, and the entire installation should be finished in under 30 minutes.\n\nFound the interface to be much cleaner than my older Office 2007 running on another older computer, and with the exception of the CAPS ON menu tabs noted above, it was a good improvement. Though I did not do any precise stopwatch timings, Office 365 seemed to load faster and smoother. The ribbon menu can be collapsed or expanded as needed. When you open up Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Publisher or the other components, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document, which is just an extra click away.\n\nWhat follows are some subjective notes about the various components found within this Office suite. I won't attempt to go too heavy into each of these as one could write a full review on most of the modules by themselves, but consider these as observations found from a few weeks use.\n\n SkyDrive:\n\nI like SkyDrive and have been using it for some time. This has been integrated quite well within Office Professional and the other Office 2013 variants, and it has built in resilience against jittery Internet connections. Should you should lose your connectivity while working on a file opened from a SkyDrive account, Office saves it temporarily on your local hard drive before synchronizing with SkyDrive at a later point in time. And what is good is that it syncs quite well so that you can retrieve/edit documents (or images) from other computers once you're logged in.\n\n Word:\n\nThe features for Word have remained largely the same as those in Office 2007 and those that I've found working on clients' Office 2010 installations. Documents often need to be edited after they are written, and Word 2013 makes the editing process easier with such new features such as the ability to edit PDF files. Previously, you needed to install third-party software, such as Adobe Acrobat. This was available to those of us who have been running Word for Mac 2011 where it does a respectable job, but is new to the PC version. Have not had much time to play with it, but if it works as well as the Mac version, then this will be a big help.\n\nAmong the new additions that I've found are that you can watch embedded videos right there within the document, and without having to go to a different application. If you work with collaborative documents, you can reply within comments and those replies will be displayed in threaded conversation style.\n\n Excel:\n\nOn a personal note, I have had a love/hate relationship with spreadsheet programs in general since the days of Microsoft Multiplan and Lotus 1-2-3, both of which are distant history now. That being said, Excel has been a program of choice for years now, and one that I've used to input table data into Word and as a flat file database for quite some time. Entering data into spreadsheets can be a tedious and boring chore, so the downward fill feature in Excel that allows you automatically fill the cells in each row with the same number by dragging down has been an ally.\n\nBut now there's a new Flash Fill feature that recognizes patterns in your data functions, then automatically fills in the rest of the spreadsheet, and complex formulas are not necessary. You can make it automatically format names the same way (such as last, first, middle initial) just by giving it some examples. Phone numbers can be converted to a uniform format, and restoring the leading zero to zip codes is a breeze. Look for the Flash Fill button on the Data tab and try it. It's well worth it.\n\n OneNote:\n\nThis is probably one of the most overlooked and underrated components of the Office suites. First encountered it in Office 2007, and it became a handy way to keep simple notes and such, but it was limited. The new version will allow you to embed Excel spreadsheets and see the preview within your note. When you update the spreadsheet, the preview automatically updates, as well. Searching within OneNote is better, as you can now search for words that are embedded in graphics files.\n\n PowerPoint:\n\nThere's a new, cleaner look to PowerPoint. You can start a new presentation using a theme, a template, an older presentation or a more recent one, as well as a blank one. New users should find PowerPoint 2013 to be more intuitive than older versions, and those who are experienced PowerPoint pros will find that everything seems to go smoother. I pulled up some old presentations, including one that was from the late 1990s, and found that doing a few edits was a very smooth process. The themes now come with variations, so tightening up on the look you want is simpler.\n\n Outlook:\n\nThere's an openness to this upgraded version. Outlook is a powerful module, but it will take new users a bit of time to learn to navigate among all of the functions and to understand the numerous toolbar icons, as I found out when showing mine to a colleague. I've been using Outlook under Office for Mac 2011 on a MacBook Pro, and never had an issue with Outlook on the OS X platform. I'm currently trying to sync the two versions as much as possible, and it seems to be working.\n\n Publisher:\n\nI personally use Publisher infrequently at this point. Like the other modules in Office Professional, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document.\n\n Access:\n\nThe Office Access relational database management system was a product that at one time was a favorite when I was converting over from dBase III many years ago. Speaking honestly, I have only accessed this module a few times for conversion of some older files... and pardon the pun.\n\n Annoyances & Irritants:\n\nMy primary gripe with the new Office suites has to do with the full ALL CAPS menu tabs, and I'm trying my best to see if I can learn to adapt or if I'll change it. As noted earlier, I don't like the \"new\" Microsoft Metro style being jammed down my throat without the option to change it easily. It's essentially the same one that we find on the Office pages on the Web. There is a workaround, but it must be done in each individual Office 2013 module that you use: go to File > Options > Customize Ribbon, then use the Rename button on each one of the main menu items listed in the right pane under Customize the Ribbon. Instead of changing the name, however, add a space to the end of the name, and then click OK. When you return to the Home tab, the ribbon menu items will be displayed in a title case, with only the first letter capitalized. You can also go back to the ALL CAPS default by resetting them.\n\n Suggestions:\n\nPutting this simply, if you're happy with Office 2007 or 2010, you may want to weigh your choices between the various versions here, read some of the reviews that best apply to your own needs, then decide whether you wish to keep the earlier version or go for the upgrade. This version was for installation on a PC that had recently been upgraded to Windows 8.1, and my installation went smoothly. It works well, though your results may differ from mine.\n\nPlease note: this review will be dynamic in that as I find experiences worth sharing, be they pro or con, they will be appended to this review. Other findings or additional resources may be listed in the comments, along with some links to resources that may prove to be helpful.\n\n Summary:\n\nThis&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Office-Professional-2013-Key-Card-1PC-1User/dp/B009SPL2K0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Office Professional 2013 Key Card 1PC/1User</a>&nbsp;version is for one PC, so be aware of this and check the specs before ordering.

The down side is that you still need to learn this program, and if you have not already learned a photo editing program, Id recommend you go with one of the more basic Adobe photo editing programs, Photoshop Elements, because at least then you are learning a program than many (most) others will know, and in the event you decide to step up to a more sophisticated (expensive) Photoshop program someday, your learning's can just be added to, rather than started all over.", "summary": "Edits photos just fine, not as powerful as other programs", "unixReviewTime": 1412380800}

After installation, you are asked if you want to enter the PC version or the Television version without any explanation of what each offers.  I chose the TV mode and right away I didn't like the menu structure.  For some very weird reason, the title bar at the bottom is very wide and actually covers up a big portion of the movie menu such as subtitles.  You just cannot select the subtitles on most movies I have watched so far.  It almost seems like PowerDVD has dropped back to VGA resolution on my 65 inch Panasonic HDTV. And I cannot seem to shrink that ultra wide black bar at the bottom that has the play, stop, pause, etc symbols.  On some movies I've seen so far, I can use that big black menu to select the subtitles, but most often not. I just cannot imagine why they created such a huge black menu bar at the bottom of the screen.  Now the black bar goes away after you start watching the move.  I have had cases where I got stuck in a menu loop and had to start the movie from the beginning.  So I thought maybe it was unique to the computer I had connected to the Panasonic HDTV.\n\nSo I installed PowerDVD 16 on my best computer that has a new $475 NVidia card inside and it is connected to an $800 40 inch UHD computer monitor. But this time I selected the PC mode and the menu bar at the bottom was acceptable. Then I switched to the TV mode and there was that broad black line again. It was a little more narrow than on my 65 inch Pansonic HDTV, but not by much.  I still had the same issues trying to activate the menu in the bottom on the Movie menu image - that is selecting the language and subtitles.\n\nI don't know what Cyberlink was thinking to create this monstrous thick black title bar that covers up the bottom part of the movie startup menu. I have almost every release of PowerDVD there is and this is the first time I've ever seen anything like this.  I will have to uninstall version 16 and go back to version 15.  I hope they come out with a new tweak to fix the huge black bar at the bottom of the screen or at least give me the option of selecting how big it is.\n\nBack to the PC and TV modes for a moment, they offer some imaging enhancement that is supposed to allow the viewer to view in original content, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% enhancement.  I tried to see the difference between these five settings and neither my wife nor I could detect even the slightest difference in any of these optional settings.  It wasn't until I installed this new release on my computer with a UHD monitor and even then it was subtle. Basically, it gives you the choice of several levels of sharpness.  So setting it to 0% (original) just passes the video as it was recorded. If you skip to the end of the movie when the credits start to scroll, you can finally see a little difference between 0% and 100%. The lettering is a little more crisp when at the 100% setting. At the lower settings, the lettering looks slightly soft or very slightly blurring or maybe out of focus for lack of more descriptive terms. But when watching the movie, I just couldn't notice the difference even on the $800 40 inch UHD monitor and $375 NVidia video card. My wife has 20/15 vision courtesy of Lasik surgery and she couldn't see any difference either except for the rolling credits at the end of the movie. Her eyesight is near perfect and much better than mine.  So yes, it makes the image a little crisper on a UHD television, but don't expect miracles.\n\nThe second option has to do with audio quality and has the same range of 0% to 100% enhancement. I have a very high quality Klipsch 7.1 sound system and I really enjoy it.  But here again, neither my 27 year old wife nor I could detect any difference in sound enhancement. She can hear far better than I can. There's probably some improvement, but without the ability to instantly switch between two entirely different sound systems in an AB comparison, I don't think it is possible to hear any difference no matter how good your hearing is.\n\nNow I don't want to be seen as overly critical. Thats not my intent.  Just moderate your expectations and don't expect miraculous improvements in the video and sound quality. There are definitely some video improvements  just subtle.  Obviously any enhancements are welcome. I it isn't a simple task to make these video adjustments in real time. And you cant create something out of nothing.\n\nI just recently upgraded to Windows 10 and from what I can determine, Microsoft didn't include any video players in the operating system.  So it appears you will have to purchase an application like PowerDVD if you plan to watch movies via your computer.  There are some fairly good free movie players and I have used two of these apps. One is called VLC and another one is called MPC-HC.  VLC is fairly popular, but I think MPC-HC is a little better, but not huge amount. If you just want a casual computer based movie player, the free players are not bad  pretty good in fact.  You won't get a lot of frills, but they certainly do the job. There were a couple of instances where I couldn't get PowerDVD to play a movie ripped to my hard drive.  PowerDVD is apparently a lot more legal than some players when it comes to hard drive copies of movies.  I have a large collection of legal DVDs and Blu-ray movies in ISO format backed up on several high capacity disks.\n\nThat reminds me of a new feature on this release of PowerDVD  it will now play a ISO movie file.  But it takes it quite a lot of time to buffer the movie in memory before you are able to play the movie.  If you use the free app called Virtual CloneDrive to play the ISO image with PowerDVD, it loads far faster than PowerDVD. So I still have to mount the movies ISO file using Virtual Clone.  And that will automatically invoke PowerDVD to play the movie file.  It is a little annoying to unmount a movie file, but it will release the movie when you select the next movie you want to watch.  You can find the free Virtual Clone Drive app at the RedFox website along with some other interesting apps. It used to be called SlySoft, but recently Slysoft mysteriously vanished overnight. Dont download any recent updates to the Slysoft apps if you purchased a license or youll have to pay for it again.\n\nMy wife is not a native English speaker, so it helps her to see what is being said. And a lot of times, the sound recordings in movies is virtually inaudible and impossible to understand what the actors are saying. So even though the subtitles are annoying, I place more value on knowing what the actors are saying.\n\nIf you don't think my review is useful, tell me the reason why in the comments so I can improve my review writing skills.", "summary": "New Display Options - One for PC and another for TV", "unixReviewTime": 1464048000}

WinDVD is probably the most useful of the quartet, offering basic DVD playback with some more advanced features for custom playback. The photo and video programs (PaintShop and VideoStudio) are Express versions, in other words, very basic stripped down versions. They do only a handful of basic things each, and because of that, they are relatively simple to use. VideoStudio offers basic adjustments (white balance, brightness, noise, shake), and you can trim or split the video, rotate the video, or take a screenshot. Snapshots go to the bottom of the page. DVD Factory is more featured like WinDVD, however, it has some flaws. For example, if you are making a disc with mp3s (Audio File), you can't just drop a folder/directory into it, you have to add the mp3 files on their own. A workaround is to create a Backup Disc instead of an Audio Disc, and then you can add folders.\n\nThis program follows the media library philosophy. Every file you want to work on or put on disc, you have to import into the program, using the Import function at the top of the window. Whether this is good or not, it depends on how you prefer to use it, how many files you have, and how you like to work. It can be useful if you are setting up a computer for someone who is not very computer-savvy.\n\nOverall, the program has performance issues. On a dual-core Vista computer it is rather painful, but on a basic quad-core Windows 7 computer it does better. The issues appear to be with the folder navigation and menus, I haven't had a crash during actual operations (eg burning a disc). But when you are wandering around in the menus or browsing folders, it's not unusual to get Windows 7 errors. Not cool in 2011, especially since this is intended to be beginner's software.\n\nThe programs start in full screen mode, which can be irritating if you are a multi-tasker.\n\nInstallation\n============\nThe installation was smooth on both Vista and Windows 7 but it takes a few minutes before it finishes. During the installation it has a handy slide-show that introduces various program features. The earlier Vista install grabbed the image file extensions, but the Windows 7 install did not.\n\nAfter the initial installation from the disc, it searches for updates online (in the background) and brings up a message asking you if you want to continue. The update installation takes a few minutes as well. No reboot! The Extras on the installation disc are just iTunes, Quicktime, and Flash which you probably have already on your computer and your computer probably has newer versions. There is very little to none flexibility in setup and configuration of the program.\n\nWhen launched for the first time, the program looks at predetermined places on your computer for videos, audio and images to import - without asking you first, and without offering a clean way to stop it. You can always kill the process with the Windows Task Manager (kill it once, it restarts, then kill it again). If you happen to have lots of stuff in the folders it is looking, or you are in middle of doing something else, you don't want this to hog your computer importing files. Then again, this is intended for beginners, so I guess it's a \"feature\".\n\nAlong with the four programs, there is a Windows gadget for quick launch of the four programs. This can be useful if you plan to use these often.", "summary": "Basic multimedia software suite (mixed bag)", "unixReviewTime": 1307232000}

Now the backup software that came with the drive won't work.  It's deleted other perfectly innocent files that I've scanned with Microsoft, McAfee and AVG too.

There was only one year (about 7 or 8 years ago) that I used something else because TaxCut was terrible. All the other years, it has been the best.\n\nA few years I had to use accountants because of the complexity of my taxes for those years. After the number of obvious mistakes that they made, I went back to doing it myself. I got tired real quick of having to pay a lot for my taxes to be done wrong and have them delivered to me on April 13.\n\nAlthough complete, there are a few (rare) forms missing and it would help if there was more information on-line and in the program. It is kind of awkward to have to go running off to the IRS site for a small but important piece of information. The program and the IRS are a little overeager to charge the AMT, even after the first time that it checks and says that I don't need to pay it. Also, there is something about my returns that makes the IRS want me to pay in advance quarterly, even though almost all of my income is only salary--not investments, etc.\n\nThey are making a lot of progress on the state versions. The first few years, I had to do half of the state forms myself. They have improved this every year and now it is as easy as the Federal version, even though state laws don't match up exactly with the federal version.\n\nThe error checking and other features of this program are really helpful, too. This year the e-mailing is included (it's about time!), although you can still file the paper forms or the reduced paper forms. You can always get a copy of your return or one form on paper--even halfway through the process, if you need it.\n\nI have never had to use their call-in service because of the completeness of the program.\n\nThey have a service that will send you the next year's program on DVD so that you can start it and pay them online for it. I got that and then found out that Amazon's price was $5.00 less and I received it in two days.\n\nAs an aside, I am not real impressed that the same thing happened to TaxCut that has happened to a lot of companies lately.

In \"Message in a Haunted Mansion\" they definitely did that while still making it a fun adventure game that wasn't horrifying.\n\nStory-You are going to help a family friend find out why there are so many accidents happening at the house that she's renovating.  Some people claim that a ghost is at work, while others think that something human is the cause.  It's up to you to find out who or what is sabotaging the renovation work.\n\nGraphics-Like the previous games, the graphics are 3D, and once again, they are pretty good.  Some of the characters have some awkward movements, but the backgrounds are very well done.\n\nSound-The music is spooky and definitely creates a good atmosphere.  There are also some creepy background sounds that happen from time-to-time to startle the player a bit.  As for the voice acting, the characters could have been voiced much better.  They often sound bored or confused as to what they are reading, but they are still good enough to not distract from the gameplay.\n\nGameplay-Just like the previous games in the series, this is a first person point-and-click adventure game.  It only takes place in one location (a mansion), but you are still able to explore many rooms as you search for clues as to who or what is causing the accidents.  There are four suspects to talk to in this game, and there are also several people that you can call on the phone to ask for help in your investigation.  There are a few puzzles in the game that are more like chores than puzzles, but they are a good variety of inventory puzzles and logic puzzles.  There are a few scary moments in the game where you see a shadow move or something in order to startle you, but they would happen over and over again at the same place that by the end of the game, you are just bored by them.  It does add a certain scare factor to the game the first time you see them, though.  There are also some bonus backstories for two of the characters that you don't necessarily have to discover to finish the game, but it was fun to figure out, and it adds a bit to the plot.\n\nLength-It's a fairly long game.  It will definitely take several hours to finish.\n\nOverall, it can be a slightly creepy game if you let it get to you.  But whether you get spooked or not, it truly is a fascinating mystery adventure game that is worth a playthrough.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE-There is also a version of this game available for the Game Boy Advance.", "summary": "Another good Nancy Drew game", "unixReviewTime": 1260576000}

I should add I also have free AV software. With respect to the effectiveness of the protection WebRoot offers, it does not have a reputation as solid as ESET NOD32, but it is not as bad as, for example, McAfee, and it has been passing most of the Virus Bulletin Board tests in recent years. Therefore I trust it enough, but not as much as the most trustworthy AV software like ESET, Norton, and Kaspersky. I should say I installed it on a computer (Windows Vista) that previously had Norton 360 3.0 installed on it (I uninstalled that). Allegedly it also installs on Windows XP SP2 and SP3 (which not all AV software does).\n\nWebRoot Anti-Virus with Spy Sweeper 2011 has a few features I like including proactive protection (internet, removable media, etc), it checks if your outbound email has been hijacked by hackers, and it includes the famed Spy Sweeper, of course. However, it does not have many of the special features that you commonly see with other AV software today like, for example, backup, on-line storage, spam filters, parental controls, data protection, vaults, WiFi verification, etc. It is a barebones kind of AV software. That is not necessarily a bad thing if you are just looking for basic protection, especially considering the reasonable price.\n\nI had no problems installing WebRoot Anti-Virus with Spy Sweeper 2011, which is not true for all AV software I've tried. In my opinion the installation took an unusually long time. One funny thing is that it asked for the activation code at the beginning and asked me to create an account.\n\nThe first full scan also took a very long time and I had troubles running the scan while using other applications. The first time I ran it I had a freeze up and had to restart the machine. This did not happen on subsequent scans. It did find one Spyware item that Norton apparently had missed, and it removed lots of cookies.\n\nThe WebRoot Anti-Virus with Spy Sweeper 2011 user interface is a little bit unconventional compared to other AV software, which is not a plus in my opinion. It is organized a little funny. I don't like is that the only time the \"Scan Now\" option is available is right after you launch the console. I could not get the \"Run Now\" option on the \"Scheduling\" page to work. I contacted customer support and was told to uninstall WebRoot and then reinstall it. I did not since I can live with this problem.\n\nMy favorite AV software is ESET NOD32 4.0 since its protection is so outstanding, but it is expensive. Kaspersky and Trend Micro are decent and not too expensive. Overall I would put WebRoot below them since it does not have a better reputation, seems to consume more system resources, and I've noticed some glitches. The thing is that unless commercial AV software is outstanding and offers free useful customer support (you pay mostly for the service) you might as well get free AV software. I use MalwareBytes since it can coexist with commercial AV software and has a good reputation and is good for hijacks. So overall I still recommend WebRoot but very reluctantly.", "summary": "WebRoot Anti-Virus with Spy Sweeper 2011 is OK but not great", "unixReviewTime": 1291939200}

When I switched to Mac, I started using Adobe Illustrator. CorelDRAW has always been the ONLY comparable product to Illustrator, and continues to be so with Suite X8. It's exclusively a Windows program, so if that's the environment you're working in, and you're looking to upgrade to a real graphics program, Suite X8 would be a great choice.\n\nAs with Illustrator, the learning curve is steep. This isn't one of those watered down vector art programs, this is the real deal, meant to give you powerful tools to create a variety of deliverables in unlimited formats. I won't waste space here listing the modules and what they do, since that's available in the above product description from Corel.  What I will make note of is the inclusion of AfterShot 2 as a built-in module that is exclusive with this release via Amazon.  AfterShot 2 gives you the same kind of photo editing power that you'll find in Photoshop, and most notably adds the ability to edit RAW files from nearly every known camera on the planet that will shoot in the RAW format.  If you don't know what RAW is, then you'll probably never use this feature, but for those who do, it's nice to know Corel has finally added the support for RAW images that have long been available in Illustrator.\n\nTHE PROS\n*If you're already a CorelDRAW user, Suite X8 is a worthy upgrade.  Most of the user interface is identical, with a few enhancements, so you'll know your way around.  There's a free 30-day tutorial available online to get you up to speed on the new features and functions.\n*This is a one-person license, but it's a permanent license with no other fees required.  Corel also has a subscription service if you want to \"rent\" CorelDRAW, similar to Adobe's Creative Cloud, if you don't want to pay the full retail price up front.  The subscription also includes free updates.\n*CorelDraw will export and import native Adobe Illustrator files if you're moving from that platform, or also use Illustrator files, and prefer to continue to work in CorelDraw.\n*As a vector creator/editor, CorelDRAW can match Illustrator feature-for-feature, even though it may do things differently than Illustrator, you can get the same things done. It really comes down to a matter of preference.\n\nTHE CONS\n*You have to have an internet connection to activate the software, and to allow them to check your license at least once a month.  Not usually a problem since if you're reading this, you have internet access, but I find it a bit intrusive.  Just a small detail.\n*While CorelDRAW is an outstanding vector art program, I find Photopaint to be an inferior cousin to Photoshop, and the website creator should be avoided altogether. Corel is trying to provide a \"value-added\" incentive by adding these other programs in a \"suite\" but I wouldn't buy CorelDRAW for its photo-editing capabilities.\n*This is ONLY a Windows program. I've always wanted Corel to port DRAW over to the Mac.  If they had, I would still be using it and probably never have started with Illustrator, which then eventually drew me in to all of the related Adobe products.  That said, CorelDRAW does offer a robust export/import function to use files from other programs, but it's not as seamless as with Illustrator.\n\nJust a reminder: This is NOT a program for newbies.  Even though Corel and everyone else touts the ease of use of their programs, there's a steep learning curve to programs like CorelDRAW and Illustrator when you reach this level of professional program.  But, don't be discouraged if you are new to this level.  You CAN learn the program, just give yourself time.\n\nI would have given five stars, but took a star off for the inept web creator.", "summary": "A WORTHY UPDATE FOR CURRENT COREL USERS", "unixReviewTime": 1463788800}

It will do most of the editing tasks that the full version of Photoshop does but at a fraction of the cost. This is the software program that I have my \"Digital Photography\" and \"Digital Painting\" students purchase for the college courses I teach.\n\nI've included a video that shows some of the editing features of Elements 13. If you are serious or semi-serious about editing photos this is the program I recommend. Since Photoshop Elements is based on the full version of Photoshop everything you learn can be easily translated to the full version of Photoshop if you decide to purchase a subscription for Photoshop CC (Creative Cloud).\n\nIf you already own a version of Photoshop Elements you can probably skip the video and scroll down to the bottom of this review to read my recommendations on whether or not it is worth upgrading to version 13.\n\nIf you just want an easy program to use to edit a few photos then there are much cheaper programs available. More importantly, there are many online photo-editing programs that are absolutely free! One of my favorite free online photo editing applications is Sumopaint.\n\nIf you are looking for a fun and easy to learn drawing/painting program you may want to check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Autodesk-SketchBook-Pro-7/dp/B00LI95DNG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Autodesk SketchBook Pro 7</a>.\n\nAdobe offers a free 30-day trial of Photoshop Elements 13 so you might want to download it first and see if you like it. The download is a pretty big file so just make sure you have a fast internet connection--and a lot of time for the installation process! You will need to create an account with Adobe before you can download the free trial.\n\nPhotoshop Elements has two basic components. The first is the Editor which is the program you use to make changes to your photos--or to paint digital paintings. The other component is the Organizer which is used to manage and organize your photos. Both are great programs. I currently have over 40,000 photos in the Organizer and with a click of a button I can easily find the photo I am looking for.\n\nAnother advantage of purchasing Photoshop Elements is that there is a lot of free material online that will help you learn how to use the program. There are also a lot of good books. Overall, my favorite Photoshop books are by Scott Kelby.\n\nMy recommendation to current Photoshop Elements Users:\n\nPhotoshop Elements 9-10: I think you would greatly benefit from upgrading. There are a lot of features that have been added--so many that I can't even remember all of them!\n\nPhotoshop Elements 11: If you are a serious user of Photoshop Elements I think you would benefit from upgrading. There are some nice new \"Guided Features\" in Elements 13 that are not in Elements 11. Also, all the little improvements to Content Aware, Photomerge, Recompose, and the Web sharing and mobile features add up enough to make it worth the money if you use Elements on a regular basis.\n\nPhotoshop Elements 12: There are not that many new features in Photoshop Elements 13 so you could probably wait a year for Elements 14 to come out. The best would be to look over the new features listed on this page or visit the Adobe site directly to see if any appeal to you enough to pay the cost. I keep upgrading because I use this software program in my courses and it is important that I have the newest version.\n\nI hope this review helps you decide if Photoshop Elements is something you want to purchase.", "summary": "See it in Action!", "unixReviewTime": 1411948800}

It's a powerful application for viewing videos, DVDs and Blu-rays, offering a huge arsenal of features... more features then any other video player I own. For me, it's easily my favorite player for viewing blu-ray movies on my computer as it does so perfectly, with no issues... unlike other programs I have that claim to play blu-ray movies (but don't).\n\nPowerDVD also acts as a library system for your videos as it allows you to browse all your movies and select which one to watch. It's a good idea that personally I'm not 100% pleased with. It seems to me it's in constant scan mode, searching my computer endlessly for videos. I haven't found a setting to turn this option off, so the result can be a slight lag when browsing of my movie directories, despite the fact that my computer is running on SSD storage. I also hate the fact that it's constantly searching my computer for videos without my permission as I feel like it's an invasion of privacy. This has been a problem since at least the last version, likely going back to at least version 12, so it's nothing new.\n\nBeing the most powerful and feature-filled video player I own also has it's drawbacks... all my other video apps will pop open a video clip instantly and begin playing... PowerDVD takes a bit longer, which makes it a poor choice for a quick video player.\n\nI will note that I have had no issues with file associates being hijacked by PowerDVD as several other reviewers have complained about. I don't remember the procedure for installing it, but I do always use 'custom'  or 'advanced' options, so possibly the file association issue occurs when people choose to do a quick installation.\n\nMy biggest complaint for this version is the lack of improvements. For the first time, my keyboard's media buttons such as pause and the volume control work perfectly with PowerDVD. Aside from that, for me at least, I have found absolutely no difference in how I use the program from version 13, and even version 12. It doesn't seem any faster or slower then previous versions either.\n\nOverall, PowerDVD 14 is a great program for people who want a full-featured video player. For those looking for a simple and cheap way to view video clips... this is not it. I would also recommend anyone with a copy of PowerDVD 11 or newer to check into the improvements, as there aren't a whole lot to make this a worthwhile upgrade.", "summary": "Good video player, but not a whole lot of improvements over previous versions", "unixReviewTime": 1404172800}

The best way to deal with this is simply to not buy anything from them whatsoever.

Now with my 5-year-old that just started kindergarten, I am hoping to get off to an early start and put this to use with her. I love that it works on iPad because every child I know is very familiar with them and knows how to operate them with ease. Not so much with a computer. Typing and using a mouse was a big obstacle, not to mention having to sit at a desk, especially for a child that can't sit still for very long.

Everything is very animated and colorful and it makes the entire process truly entertaining. The little \"Lingos\" are very cute and add a lot to the lessons. The way the skills transition is also very smooth and well thought out. It starts with the basics, names of letters and letter sounds, and then starts building from there, putting sounds together two at a time, and eventually putting them into full words.

It will give them a huge leg up. With public school curriculum getting more and more challenging all the time, kids are expected to be reading fluently in first grade and there's not much opportunity for catch up as the reading skill is required for all other subjects.

While I will say that everything appeared to be working properly, and all relevant numbers and calculations were being updated whenever I changed an entry, I am concerned that this may not always be the case with so many scripts that stop responding.

It is a good solid product. Back in the DOS days Norton Utilities was a godsend, correcting errors before they turned into total system crashes. Then the company was sold and everything they put out was terrible; it caused more problems than it solved. Well all of that has changed. June 2010 issue of Consumer Reports rates Norton Internet Security 2010 as their top rated pick stating, \"It is one of the best products tested for detecting web sites that host malware, and for speed in scanning a hard drive for threats\". I think that about says it all. It's the most effective, and the fastest. What else is there?\n\nI ran speed tests back then when removing McAfee and installing Norton in order to see which one had the longer boot time and once again Norton came out on top. I have not had any problems whatsoever running Norton Internet Security 2010, 2011, Norton 360 for 2012-13, and now Norton 360 2014. The price has come down some since I acquired it. It is good for up to 5 independent devices whether they be laptops, desktops, and now even covers your cell phone. I have a Windows Cell Phone and as is the case for that relative newbie not many programs are written for it including this version of Norton 360. I have seen others reporting that it slows their boot time on their cell phone.\n\nIf you are removing McAfee from your machine and you should before installing Norton be sure to not only use the Control panel add remove programs utility but also to Google how to remove it from the web because they have a downloadable utility in order to completely remove it from your system. You never want to install two different antivirus programs on top of one another. However just like when I installed 360 right on top of my 2011 version of Norton and as I suspected it automatically recognized it and did all of the chores for me including removing the old version before installing the new. I also noticed that most of my machines that I installed it in after putting in the activation code/product key it came back as being successfully installed and activated. Only on my main machine that probably received the initial install of Norton back in 2010 when I first started using it did it actually call up the online activation without automatic approval; it required that I log into my Norton account with user name and password in order to activate, but that was the only one. I checked and they all have the subscription of 366 days unless they surprise me in the future requiring a user ID and pass code as well.\n\nI see some users are having issues with Windows 8 and Norton but for Vista and 7 it is solid gold.

Indeed, I kept Office 2004 on my computer for five months after I installed this suite, so I could do side-by-side comparisons and decide which version to keep.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n* PowerPoint functionality is more robust.\n* PowerPoint themes make it simple to assemble an attractive basic presentation on the fly. While documentation and help are sketchy, applying brute force logic (and some experience with Photoshop and Quark) enabled me to make PowerPoint do some visual processes I thought that it \"should\" be able to do.\n* Word loads faster and is more intuitive. It also has more modular components.\n* PDF creation in Word is a simple \"save-as\" menu selection, which saves time compared with the print>save as PDF workaround.\n* Anecdotally, Excel and Word are much better-behaved than the previous versions, with no and few hangs, respectively. I am a light user of Excel but use Word daily; the almost-daily aggravation is a thing of the past.\n\nTHE CAUTIONS:\n* As with other Microsoft products, this suite does chew through a lot of resources. However, after trying out its svelter competition, I come back to Office for my personal use because of the convenience of using what most other folks use.\n* Despite multiple attempts and multiple unanswered electronic queries to Microsoft, I have not been able to complete the online registration/tagging that is the last step of the install. (All seems well without it, but this situation leaves me a bit uneasy.)\n* The install process is time-consuming. Allow at least two hours to install the software and then download and install multiple patches, even with lots of free space available on your hard drive.

It is clear Corel does not care one bit for it's users and is interested in making money on a program, whether it works or not.  The new text tool could work if there was a user manual or the help files explained it properly.  As it is, the only way to apply text is by trial and error, a very frustrating experience.  I have been using this program since version 8 and it seems that they have gone out of their way to make it worse.  There is a project part of the program but there is no way to get photos into the project workspace.  It just doesn't function.  I wrote to Corel about this and they said they know it's a problem.  So it seems I've paid for a program they know doesn't work and have been really shafted by Corel.  The program is very new and already there is an update that so far fixes nothing.

There were a couple times where I switched off autonegotiate on a port and a particular PC because of an intermittent link outage and I was suspecting a problem with the autonegotiate.  But in the end, both times ended up being the same RJ-45 plug at the PC end of the 60 foot CAT-5 cable.  After finally cutting it off and crimping on a new connector, my intermittent problem went away.  This was one of my gig links.  My system maxes out at 450 Mbps point-to-point so I can't test at gig speeds.  Inserting the switch did not make any difference which is good.  One time, I configured three ports in two VLANs, (i.e. port 1 tagged to VLAN 2; port 2 untagged to default VLAN; port 3 tagged to VLAN 2 and a member of the default VLAN).  I could not get it to work with my PCs but I believe my NICs were not working properly with VLAN tags because Wireshark on all three computers never showed me a tagged frame even when I ran straight cable between two PCs configured for tagged VLANs.  In any event, while going through all these configuration changes on the switch, it never locked up or acted strangely.  The unaffected ports outside my little VLAN test remained functional.

It contains fewer Office products than the Professional edition.  Check the listing here to really understand editions, as some users are accidentally purchasing the wrong one.  What you are buying here is either a 'Download' stored in your Amazon digital locker complete with license key or a 'Key Card'--plastic card with the license key printed on it that is shipped to you.  Both download and key-card involve downloading Office.\n\nAlso, Office 2013 is NOT compatible with Windows XP or Vista.  It requires you to have Windows 7 or 8.\n\nThe Short Form\nThere were some good ideas behind the improvements to Office 2013, but poor execution, a confusing bid to sell Office 365, and licensing issues (that have since been improved) have tripped up this version of Office.  You'll survive with it on a new computer, but there aren't a lot of reasons to upgrade if you already have an existing version of Office.\n\nThe Good\nIf you're a long-time user of Office, there aren't a lot of incentives in Office 2013 to make you want to jump onto the bandwagon apart from the fact that it really does load faster and respond fairly snappily, even on older hardware.  The UI is another step beyond what Office 2010 did, offering a flatter-looking ribbon, more stuff dumped into the ribbon, and yet more of those full-screen interface menus that now resemble the 'Modern UI' front-end of Windows 8 and Windows Phone.  There are little pleasantries, like files flowing more seamlessly in and out of SkyDrive, and the way the cursor tracks as you type is a surprisingly nice detail.  One of the things Microsoft has been trying to do is make your Windows Live/Microsoft/Hotmail/X-Box/SkyDrive account a one-stop shop for all things Microsoft, and so if you set up Windows and/or Office to tie directly into that, little fringe benefits like the aforementioned SkyDrive are dropped into your programs.\n\nInstallation of Office 2013 is a breeze--it is surprisingly fast, in minutes if you've already downloaded the files.  It's also slightly simpler than earlier versions, getting quickly to the \"Install now/Customize\" screen.  The first step is a doozy, though:  you might start off with an Office 365 prompt that tells you to enter in the e-mail address associated with your Office install.  Pay attention to the \"I want to use a Product Key\" link on that screen:  it flips you from, \"I'm about to accidentally kick off a 90-day Office 365 Trial\" to \"I have a license key, now where do I type it in?\".  The first time I did this I thought this was about tying Office to my Microsoft account, so I went that route and ended up getting e-mails about my Office 365 Trial, how I can use Office via a browser, etc., etc.; and after the trial, I realized my mistake because Office 'deactivated'.  I had to go back in and properly 'Activate' office with my key.\n\nThe Bad, Lumped In With The Ugly\nUnfortunately, we then come to the 'look and feel' and that's where things start to literally get ugly.  Office 2013 has a default color palette of \"One color, black text, and white all over the place.\"  There are two other color schemes, but no other way to customize the interface nor any downloadable themes.  All three options, \"White\", \"Light Gray\", and \"Dark Gray\" end up adding to the eyestrain.  The menus we lost in the Ribbon of 2007 to 2007's circular candy-button were put back in Office 2010 as colored tabs, and in 2013 they SHOUT AT YOU IN ALL CAPS.  \"FILE HOME VIEW...\" they say, and I feel like my dad just sent me an e-mail.\n\nBecause of the work I do, I often have to have two versions of Office installed at the same time.  Just like 2007 and 2010, it's possible to have a dual install, but some products are going to screw up.  My Outlook 2010 was completely removed, and MS Project (sold separately) still really hates to sit on the same machine with another version.  I now have regular licensing dust-ups, where one product or another claims that there was a problem in activating Office and starts running some sort of setup screen.  I then have to close everything, reboot, and run through activating Office again.  My fault for being weird and running two versions, but I tell you this so you know to avoid trying to keep both on the same machine--pick one or the other.\n\nThe Bottom Line\nIf you have a new PC that came with Office 2013 or you work for an organization that makes you move to 2013, there will be times when something you just got used to in 2007 or 2010 has been changed or moved, but you will otherwise get by.  If you already have Office 2007 or 2010, there's not a huge incentive to move to 2013--the pros are outweighed by the cons.", "summary": "Good, Just Not Enough", "unixReviewTime": 1374019200}

I have a lot of devices, many of those with ethernet ports. For instance, I have a PRISMIQ Media Player that hooks to the TV to watch videos and photos stored on the computer.\n\nThat device has BOTH an ethernet port for wired lans, and a PCMCIA slot to insert a wireless networking card, but it must be of a given brand and model (from a list of supported cards).\n\nI wanted to hook the device to my LAN without drilling holes on walls, and I didn't want to have to seek a special pcmcia card. So I went with one Sony PCWA-DE80. I connected to the Prismiq ethernet port and Bingo!, instant wireless connectivity to my Netgear 802.11a Wireless Access Point!.\n\nA bonus with one of these devices you can say GOODBYE to WIFI driver issues. You just need a WIFI access point next to your adsl or cable modem, and this device. Then you can hook ANYTHING with a working ethernet port to your wireless lan!. It could be  a PC or any other device (could be a game console!). You plug the Sony ethernet-to-wifi converter into the device's RJ45 ethernet port and ... instant wireless connectivity. As far as the PC or  device is concerned, it's talking to a wired ethernet, even while it's not, as the sony devices bridges wifi to wired ethernet networks!.\n\nSetup is a breeze. Just point your browser to the devices's IP address and enter your wifi configuration data (supports wep up to 128 bits), the IP address that you want assigned to it, and that's it!. Then when you plug this unit to any device with an ethernet port, that device will immediately connect to your wifi network!. I even used one of these boxes to get instant WiFi connectivity on my old lan server running IBM OS/2, an operating system that doesn't have plenty of WiFi cards supported (if any).\n\nAnother bonus: switch operating systems painlessly, don't worry about the availability of wifi drivers!. I test software for a living, so I often find myself installing several flavors of Linux on my notebook. However, availability of Wifi drivers for Linux is scarce. So, instead of having to thinker with the computer, I just tell linux to use the notebook's ethernet port, and I then plug the SONY ethernet to wifi converter and that's it. Instant connection and no need to drill holes on the walls.\n\nThe downside: It's expensive, like most Sony gear. You can probably find several less expensive \"ethernet to Wi-Fi\" converters on the market, but to my knowledge the Sony ones are the ONLY that support the 5 Ghz 802.11a standard!, all cheaper devices work ONLY in the 2.4 Ghz frequency, using either 802.11b or 802.11g. I choose 802.11a because, while older, the 5 Ghz band is less prone to interference from 2.4 Ghz cordless phones, microwave ovens (did you know your microwave oven operates at 2.4 ghz?), and wireless security cameras, all of which pollute the 2.4 Ghz frequency spectrum.\n\nThe PCWADE80 works BOTH in 2.4 Ghz frequency (802.11b ang \"g\") and also in 802.11a.

But the books provided by NOLO in the Library as PDFs, do mention the specific forms and numbers, so you can locate those specific forms. The Checklists were very useful to me as a newbie to law and forming an LLC. The checklists provide excellent guidance on what forms to use. With anything Legal,\nthere is always a lot of reading required, but it is informative, rather than being nonsensical.  Some of the other checklists include creating corporations, writing business plans, obtaining licenses, insurance, hiring workers, closing and selling business, etc.\n\nThe Library includes several PDF versions of NOLO books with tons of useful information and contracts. I looked through some of the contracts and they will definitely be useful to me. Lastly, the Contacts section creates a list/database of all your contacts mentioned in your documents for quick access. This is very convenient as well. The software is excellent if you are a beginner or intermediate user to law and legal issues. If you've dealt with these before, you may or may not benefit from this software.

By most accounts, Windows 7 is what Vista should have been.  Do we finally have a worthy successor to XP?\n\n** CLEAN UPGRADE UPDATE BELOW 10/29/09 **\n\nPROS:\n- Fast startup and performance\n- Stable\n- Nice aesthetic and functional changes to the desktop\n- Improved networking, power management & security\n- 32-bit & 64-bit versions included\n- Windows Media Center\n- Windows XP Mode\n\nCONS:\n- User Account Control still annoying\n- Upgrade can be challenging\n- Expensive\n\n** CLEAN UPGRADE UPDATE 10/29/09 **\nIt seems that a lot of upgraders have been complaining about the upgrade process, especially from XP. Most of us expected to be able to format our hard disks and be prompted for either the XP disc or product key. Alas, this is not the case. The upgrade is much more complicated than it should be and some workarounds have been discovered\n\nMethod A (simplest)\nIf you already have an older version of Windows on the hard drive, finish the Custom Install,  without entering the product key.  After installation, go to your System Properties and click the link to activate Windows.  Enter your product key and it should activate.  This has worked for me twice.\n\nMethod B (hardest)\nIf Method A doesn't work, try the registry hack.\n1. Finish the custom install without entering the product key then click Start and type regedit.exe into the \"Search programs and files\" box.\n2. In the registry, navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Setup/OOBE/.  In the pane on the right, you'll see an entry for MediaBootInstall.  Double-click on it and change the value from \"1\" to \"0\" and click OK.\n3. Close regedit and go to Start -> All Programs -> Accessories then right-click on Command Prompt and select \"Run as administrator.\"  You'll get a UAC alert, click Yes.\n4. At the command prompt, type: slmgr /rearm and hit Enter.  Reboot.\n5. Now try to activate.  If it fails, make sure there are no pending Windows Updates to install.  If there is, install them, reboot and start over from Step 4.\n\nMethod C (most time consuming)\nPerform the Custom Install and skip the product key. Once completed, run the upgrade again from within Windows 7 but this time, enter the Windows 7 upgrade key and then activate Windows.\n** END UPDATE **\n\nI had been running the Windows 7 release candidate for 3 months and the full version 2 weeks before official release date. The experience convinced me to finally upgrade my Windows XP systems to 7. This review briefly touches upon some of the key features and enhancements of Microsoft's latest OS.\n\nPERFORMANCE & STABILITY\nOne of the welcome enhancements Microsoft made was start-up time.  The shutdown time has been improved as well.  Also, in my non-benchmarked experience, Windows 7 has been at least as fast as XP if not faster.  The kernel changes and ability to run the 64-bit version probably has a lot to do with that.  Most benchmarks from around the Internet seem to support my observations.\n\n64-BIT\nI am elated to finally upgrade to a 64-bit operating system in order to take advantage of more memory support and modern processors.  I have Intel Core 2 Duo processors in both my systems with 4GB of physical RAM but XP only allowed 3.25GB for system use.\n\nDESKTOP\nAt first login, you'll notice the changes to the taskbar.  The taskbar is no longer just a place to store quick launch icons and view open windows.  It now provides functionality in the form of Jump Lists, which allow you to select your most frequently opened files or links from the apps you have \"pinned\" on the taskbar.  The clock and calendar are improved and the Show Desktop icon is now integrated in the far right corner.  Other desktop enhancements include Aero Peek, Aero Shake, Snap, new themes and wallpapers.  You also get gadget support.  All of these features combine to create a much improved and enjoyable desktop experience.\n\nLIBRARIES\nWindows 7 introduces a new feature called libraries.  Previously, your system had shortcuts to My Documents, My Music, My Pictures, etc. which had files residing in only those specific folders.  Files can now reside anywhere on your system and be organized inside libraries.  It's similar to how many music and photo applications organize files.\n\nNETWORKING\nEven as good as XP was, networking was cumbersome.  Windows 7 makes connecting two or more Windows 7 systems together easy, using HomeGroup.  This enables easy sharing of files and devices.  One downside is that HomeGroup is only supported between Windows 7 systems.  File transfer performance between computers has been vastly improved and connecting to a wireless network has never been easier on a Windows machine.\n\nSECURITY\nSecurity in Windows 7 is good and comes with Windows Firewall and Defender.  Still, you'll probably want to invest in a more comprehensive Internet security suite, like Norton's.  User Account Control (UAC) has been tweaked in order to give user accounts more flexibility in controlling their own security as well as providing more detailed information so the user can make better decisions about whether to allow certain actions.  Coming from XP however, it is still annoying.  Also, in Windows 7 Ultimate, you can encrypt entire hard drives as well as external portable storage devices, like USB thumb drives.  Though this is a welcome integrated feature, much of the functionality can be found in a popular open-source program called TrueCrypt.\n\nPOWER MANAGEMENT\nPower management has been improved overall and you should be able to squeeze more battery life out of your laptop, even when using your DVD drive.  Sleep and resume has also been improved.  XP wasn't always consistent when entering or resuming from sleep mode, but Windows 7 has been perfect.\n\nWINDOWS MEDIA CENTER\nI've only briefly played around with WMC but it looks promising.  It has some fun options for media, especially when you're connected to the Internet.  It may even be an adequate replacement for component DVR's should you choose to use it as the centerpiece to your entertainment center.  The biggest advantage for me is that Windows 7 now includes a DVD decoder.  This means that I can now watch DVD's natively.  WMC is available in all Windows 7 editions except Starter.\n\nWINDOWS XP MODE\nFor applications that ran in XP, but won't on 7, there is now XP Mode.  It isn't perfect and your system has to have virtualization support and turned on.  Go to your system BIOS to check.  If supported, then install Windows Virtual PC and Windows XP Mode. Check your hardware if you intend to use XP Mode.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\nIf you're an XP holdout, like I was, I recommend upgrading.  Vista SP2 users may have less reason to upgrade but might want to just for the changes to the taskbar and the UAC improvements.  For users who don't need to use their computers in a corporate environment, then Windows 7 Home Premium edition is a good choice.  I'm guessing most power users will choose Professional.  I suggest a clean install for best results.  If you're a Mac OS X user, there is probably nothing in Windows 7 compelling enough for you to consider switching.\n\nSUMMARY\nWindows 7 is the premium Microsoft OS that Windows users have been waiting for.  It's fast, secure, stable, visually appealing and fun to use.  Windows 7 will make your old system feel fresh and new again.  New system owners with Windows 7 pre-loaded can feel confident that they're getting the best Windows OS ever produced.", "summary": "Here Comes Windows 7", "unixReviewTime": 1256169600}

You do not need to pay the money to buy the boxed set to upgrade if you never upgraded to Leopard. This means that you can upgrade a Tiger computer to Leopard using this disk. It is up to the user to determine if they have an ethical problem with that; Apple certainly knew that this was possible when they released the software: they understand and use DRM effectively and always have. The fact it is missing here tells me that they are primarily concerned with getting Snow Leopard unto as many computers as possible as fast as possible. I am sure part of that is the desire to have Snow Leopard outperform Windows 7 which debuts in October. If you are updating from Leopard, Apple has continued to make it inexpensive for a family using more than one machine by pricing the upgrade at about $10.00 a machine (assuming you use all five). Not bad.\n\nSo what do you get with Snow Leopard? The answer is largely performance boosts, although many of those are not really applicable (yet) since few (virtually none) third party applications use the performance gains offered by Snow Leopard. Similar to Windows 7s ability to load share between CPU and GPU, many of the changes in Snow Leopard will take several years for developers to really start to use and write programs for.\n\nRelying on 64-bit architecture through the entire OS, Snow Leopard is essentially an upgrade for the future: as developers write programs that take advantage of the new, higher ceiling, end users like you and I will benefit. For now, most of the performance increases are only applicable to Apple's own software. However, that's not to say these aren't nice or useful, and in some cases very impressive:\n\n1) Opening large photos is faster in preview mode\n\n2) Quicktime uses significantly less CPU on all Macs regardless of generation. Older Macs benefit the most with as much as 40% performance gains.\n\n3) Time Machine backups take about 20% less time\n\n4) Snow Leopard itself installs faster than Leopard\n\n5) Boot times are faster with Snow Leopard by 5-10%; Shut down times are slightly faster as well.\n\n6) File compression is also faster by 10-15%\n\n(These are somewhat simplified. If you want the exact numbers you can find them online: Google \"Snow Leopard Performance\")\n\nOf all of these, the performance increases afforded to older first generation Macbooks are the most significant. Breathing new life into older hardware isn't easy, especially not significant improvements. Snow Leopard manages to do just that and make even slower 1.6ghz MacBooks that much more useful.\n\nInstallation itself is a SNAP (did I mention it takes less time than Leopard?). I've already upgraded a MacBook and MacBook Pro, and installation was simple, fast, and easy. I plan to install Snow Leopard on another older Macbook later in the week and will upgrade this review once I have.\n\nThe few new visual tweaks are nice, but not the reason to upgrade. Better stacks is useful, as is the quickness of Finder, but overall I don't find myself blown away by the upgrade. This isn't an entirely new OS with a fantastic array of improvements, aside from the welcome and useful performance increases. That said, if you are a power user or just observant, you WILL NOTICE the speed increase, especially in Finder.\n\n*****UPDATE September 2nd 2009*****\n\nA few other changes of minor importance but sometimes great usefulness:\n\n1) Air Port now shows all available wireless networks and their relative signal strength, something Windows has done going back to XP, but that for some strange reason has been absent from OSX 10. X until now. Now when you turn on the Air Port you get a drop down to select which wireless signal you want as well as signal strength.\n\n2) The date has been added to the desktop. This isn't that amazing but it is useful.\n\n3) I am LOVING the way stacks work now. They're so much more intuitive to use and navigate, especially the ability to brows through directories directly from the stack itself.\n\n4) Trash has the ability to restore a file to it's original location right from the trash. This is a feature common to Windows that has been very strangely absent from Mac OS. It's nice to see them catch this omission and correct it, but very odd it took this long to do it.\n\nA MAJOR complaint:\n\n1) Seriously, no support for CS3? Why Apple, why? I don't have the grand to drop on the newest version of CS. This is very, very frustrating, and makes me wish I could take back a star and downgrade this to a 4-star review. CS3 is still so widely used that I'm amazed Apple decided not to offer support for it. If you want to continue to receive support for CS3 or don't have the money to upgrade to CS4, this could be a big deal and even a reason not to upgrade.\n\nA Minor complaint:\n\n1) One of my time machine back-ups for a co-workers Mac was seemingly corrupted by the upgrade. Fortunately they didn't have any old data they needed from that backup so I just made a new one with Snow Leopard that mounts just fine, but this is something to be aware of. If you have a critical time machine backup that you cannot afford to lose, I'd suggest making a backup of the entire drive (clone it) using SuperDuper! or something like it.\n\n*****End of update*****\n\nSnow Leopard will grow in usefulness as time passes. As I said earlier, once third party applications start to be written to take advantage of advancements in the OS, the performance overhead will become more and more useful. Expect to wait 6-12 months for that to happen, but in the mean time at least you're enjoying speedier OS performance for an very inexpensive price!", "summary": "More than meets the eye", "unixReviewTime": 1251417600}

Many of my images are big because they eventually go on tee shirts or posters but need to be uploaded to my company in condensed form. It is a simple matter to convert the images to JEPG before sending them to  PhotoDirector, but I wish this step was not necessary.\n\nThe software works with Windows 7. Windows 8, Vista and XP 32 bit, but with XP Service Pack 3 is required. It supports Mac OS. The 350 MB package downloaded to my Windows 7 Ultimate without a hitch. In a single package you can organize your photos, adjust, edit and share. The editors say PhotoDirector exceeds the capabilities of PhotoShop Lightroom.\n\nThe five PhotoDirector Modules appear at the top of your canvas.\n\nLibrary- where your imported photos will be stored. While in the library your images can be sorted by tagging them, plunking them into a smart collection, album or folder.\n\nAdjustments- this is a fine playpen where you can whip your photo into shape and plug and play. Instant views of your adjustments can be seen by running your mouse over the thumbnails of imported Images at the bottom of your canvas. All of the adjustments are on your left. Tones, brightness and subtle tinges, red eye, cropping, the application of presets and literally hundreds of face lifts can be applied to your photos. Sliders can be manipulated to zero in on exactly the effect that you want. An HDR (high dynamic range) selection allows you to apply brilliant color to an image.\n\nEdit- here you apply makeover tools to your portraits. Zapping wrinkles, smoothing skin, re-shaping an out of shape bod will make you popular with your friends whose pictures you manipulate. The Eye Blinger lets you brighten eyes, darken lashes and eyebrows and much more via special brushes. Watermarks can also be applied from this module and are created here, too.\n\nSlideshow- Slideshows are created here and can be accompanied by music and exported to UTube if you wish. The booklet that is included with PhotoDirector  explains how to do this. All of the modules are covered in this Users Guide and explained with easy to follow directions.\n\nPrint- here you can customize the layout, and the way images are displayed and more by zooming, rotating and other maneuvers.\n\nPhotoDirector4 Ultra has a lot to offer for the money.

The box says that most people type no more than 40 words per minute.  I type over twice that.  I use this software when I want to send a letter to a friend.  I would not use this for business purposes.  You spend a lot of time correcting and \"training\" the system.  I find far fewer mistakes when I'm typing it myself than when I'm using this software.  But again, I type relatively fast.  Having spent a LOT of extra money to purchase the \"Preferred\" edition, I really wish I had stuck with the \"Standard\" edition.  Using it for Excel (not available on the Standard edition)  is cumbersome at best, and being that often times numbers are so important in spreadsheets, it's quite \"error prone\" and correcting a lot of numbers in a spreadsheet is not fun.  Again, I'm not really knocking the software.  I think it does a relatively good job overall, and I'm sure that if you take the time to make all of the corrections it gets better. .  .. but. . . I think if you type fast to begin with, you're probably not going to be too happy with this software.

He did NOT want this line to snap to one of the connection points on these objects. In other words, he wanted a LINE, not a CONNECTOR in Office 2003 lingo. Connectors are fun little things for drawing org charts, but we wanted a plain old LINE.\n\nWe tried every variety of line or arrow we could find. Every one snapped to the connection points. After 10 minutes (at our combined billing rate, more than the cost of Microsoft Office), we resorted to the documentation.\n\nWe found the answer! The icon for LINE is not a LINE. It is a blobular shape with a right angle on the bottom and a curvy part on top, called a \"Freeform\". It turns out that all other line-shaped tools have been promoted to connectors, and Freeform is the only tool you can use to draw a line that is NOT a connector. This is a bit awkward, since a line has two ends, and a freeform has infinite inflection points, so you have to double click at the end of your freeform to indicate that you just want a simple two-point line.\n\nWow!\n\nI am really not interested in becoming the tech support guy who has to retrain experienced, educated people that \"When you want a line, choose the blobular tool called 'freeform' because that's what Bill Gates says you should do.\" I wonder what Microsoft could have accomplished with their development dollars if they had focused on real enhancements instead of changing lines to blobular freeform thingies.

While is does a pretty good job, I quickly realized that I would need a slightly more comprehensive editing package to get them where I ultimately wanted them and to remove imperfections and blemishes.  It seems that PSP can make changes to a Sony RAW file, but it cannot save it back to ARW or even to RAW format (it saved an 'empty' file).  You have to export it to JPG right then.  Given this limitation, I will still be using Sony's RAW converter and use this for further editing.  Furthermore, I think most photographers would recommend that you use the manufacturers RAW converter for best results.\n\nThe software is laid out well and I can quickly go from browsing photos to editing and back again.  There are also many filters and effects that are easily applied with the click of a button.  NIK Color Efex Pro 3.0 is really great with alot of filters that are adjustable.  The filters in PSP are not adjustable, so the ability to tweak them in Efex is really nice.  I have not found alot of use for FaceFilter Studio 2 as you can do much of the color and skin tone adjustments in PSP.  This is supposed to allow you to tweak facial expressions, but it does not let you zoom into faces in order to place the markers.

While I experienced some lockups and freezing, it didn't happen that often.  What prompted me to switch to XP was a desire for better memory management (Windows 98 doesn't do a very good job), more stability even though Win98 wasn't bad for me, and an overall change of scenery.  So finally I made the plunge, doing a clean install instead of trying to upgrade over 98.\nThe Upgrade Advisor that you can download from Microsoft.com was very useful.  Luckily everything except my NEC printer was compatible with XP.  Next, the Transfer Settings and Files Wizard that comes on the XP disk also came in handy.  It gathers all your settings and/or files from the \"old computer,\" saves them in a file (or transfers them directly - you have various options) which you can then put on the new computer.  I wound up transferring only settings using the wizard.  Originally I told it to transfer files too, but it copied too many things that were unnecessary and the result was way too big to fit on a cd.  I would advise copying your documents and other important files manually but letting XP transfer your settings.  That way you can be more selective about what gets transferred (assuming you are doing a clean install).\nInstallation of XP went very smoothly.  It identified all my hardware, and I was able to reinstall my software with no problems.  Using the Transfer Wizard to move the settings to the new installation worked fine and was a real time saver - it moved all of my internet and e-mail settings and messages over with ease.  All user input was very clearly explained and the process overall was quite simple.\nUsing XP: There's a lot I still have to learn, but so far the system has been stable and I notice memory is managed much better than under 98.  It loads faster and while the much more colorful layout took some getting used to, now it seems like 98 is in black and white by comparison.  I also use the \"clear type\" option for fonts and find that they are easier to read than under a \"normal\" display (it seems to me that the main difference is that clear type makes it darker and bolder).\nI'm glad I made the switch.  I've read some complaints about installation experiences and also the strict registration requirements but my experience so far has been all positive (knock on wood, of course!).

You can use OpenOffice, which is a free open source office suite.  or, of course, you can run the MS Office suite on your Mac sans-windows using Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac.\n\nPersonally, I do need to use Word and PowerPoint and Excel both at home and at work, and it's especially nice to have a native app, because I don't like running a VM if I don't have to (maybe if my laptop were newer I wouldn't mind letting a VM run idle all the time, but I so rarely use it that it seems silly).  Also, VM's tend to drain batteries on laptops, so I like to avoid using one when I'm not plugged in to the wall.  Interestingly, I often needed something other than Office 2007 for Windows because everyone else in the world had upgraded past 2007, and 2007 doesn't open the newer .docx file formats without downloading converters ... I've used Apple's Pages, Apple's TextEdit, and Sun's OpenOffice and of course MS Office 2008 for Mac.  To make a long story short: there are a lot of options and I've tried them all.

I'm running a MacBook Pro with a 2.33GHz Core 2 Duo, and 2GB of RAM.  I'm a computer guy, I work for an information security company, I keep things patched and updated and running clean ... and ever since installing this, my system has been running slower.  I should have known better than to provide an admin password during install, as there's no reason that an office suite needs that level of access.  When Word or PowerPoint is running, it seems to get worse.  There are always 2 Microsoft processes running, one of which consumes about 2% of my CPU no matter what.  This is bearable overall, but it earns the product a 1-star rating for this category.\n\nDOCUMENT DESIGN: Just in case anyone is looking for Word to create flyers and such, I want to say that if you are, look elsewhere.  Word is notoriously bad at formatting anything other than text-based documents.  If you own a Mac and need these types of features, get&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/iWork-09/dp/B0014X2UAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">iWork '09</a>&nbsp;and use Pages, which is great at creating vivid and lively brochures, resumes, menus, etc.  I'm not providing a star rating for this category, because Word should never be evaluated in this category by a Mac user (and this is Office for Mac, after all).\n\nENTOURAGE: A decent enough mail app, but again, why not just use Mail?  It comes with your Mac, and in about three months from now (in Sep 2009) Mail will support the few remaining Exchange features that Entourage can handle (and even entourage doesn't handle exchange accounts that well, IMO).  So again, no star rating here: only use entourage if your IT guy makes you. Wait, this is the Home & Student edition, so unless you're Bill Gates, you aren't running an exchange server in your home.  And if your school is running exchange, transfer.  Quickly.\n\nOVERALL the product works, and the minor inconvenience of slowing things down will probably go unnoticed (or less noticed) on newer Macs than mine.  However, this flaw is largely responsible for bringing a 4.5 star overall rating down to 3 stars.", "summary": "Do you really need Office?", "unixReviewTime": 1245283200}

Rosetta stone converts foreign words straight to pictures and ideas, eliminating internal translation to one's native language.

Plus, it's extensible, so you can download extensions that will allow you to export tax-relevant transactions to the TXF format (used by TurboTax), or perform a number of other useful features.\n\nFinally, Moneydance absolutely CRUSHES Quicken when it comes to data freedom - it stores all your data in XML format, and can easily export data should you ever want to move back to Quicken (you know, if you're a masochist) or to any other financial title.  Anyone who's ever tried to extract a decade's worth of data from Quicken will be sure to appreciate this feature, and recognize the confidence the developer must have in his software if he doesn't feel compelled to trap you into using it (a la Intuit).\n\nSince Intuit can't be bothered to write good financial software for the Mac, support developers that can.

Updates are clearly just a way to \"milk\" users for more money but we're used to this, like Norton antivirus subscriptions.  But, when I update Norton, my computer still works okay.  I usually kept updating Quicken even though I didn't really need it.  If you get too far behind, the risks and learning curves just get higher.  I only use Quicken as a checkbook and for Bill Pay.  It has been flawless in paying bills so I'm happy about that.  What Quicken does is to release a new and buggy version every year, just before the end of the year.  After about 9 months, the bugs are worked and on the 10th month, they release a new version and here we go again.  I've learned over the years not to upgrade at the earliest opportunity because of bugs and because the upgrade gets cheaper later.  I saw the 2012 upgrade offered in 2011 but I waited. Then, in February 2012, I downloaded TurboTax from Amazon.  This went smoothly.  Amazon then sent me a killer low price Quicken 2012 offer.  Due to stupidity and greed on my part, I took the bait.  I have downloaded a number of s/w programs from Amazon and they have gone smoothly and installed without problems, including Quicken 2012 (not all prior Quicken versions installed without errors).  But, when I ran Q12, I found that I could no longer update my Wells Fargo checking account transactions.  Even though I am a simple (and now studid) user, I need the downloads to help me determine when I will run out of money in my checking account.  I try to not keep any more money there than I have to because very little interest is paid.  I had read about problems with downloads earlier but thought maybe they had been fixed or would not affect me.  So, here I am, what do I do?  I couldn't just \"restore\" my Q2011 version because the download and install didn't save the configuration before the new install (the TurboTax download and install DID save the current configuration).  So, I can't go back to my tried and true Q11 without some risk of losing my data.  I did research on the internet and via help but no solutions.  This is like buying a new car, driving it home, and then having to change the timing belt (by yourself) before you can drive it again.  Wells Fargo, and other banks, offer Bill Pay and it's free or at a nominal charge (6.95 for me versus 9.95 for Quicken).  So, I'm just a little ways away from dumping Quicken for good.  I can understand that new s/w features may have problems but I can't understand how simple things, like downloading transactions, can get broken.  Fortunately, Bill Pay seems to still be working.  It you're smarter than me, at least save your current configuration before installing Q12.\n\nRe-edited 2/13/12 to add the following:  Received a comment on this post from a Quicken support person that I could always \"go back to Q11\".  So, I uninstalled Q12 and re-installed Q11. But YOU CAN'T GO BACKWARDS this way because Q12 REFORMATS your data file.  When I tried to restore the data file in the re-installed Q11, an error message says \"QUICKEN can't read this file\"!!!  So, I had to uninstall Q11 and re-install Q12 so I could at least read my data and pay bills.  If Quicken had simply created a Windows Backup file before installing Q12, I would hope that a reversion via Windows Restore would work.  I just don't like taking chances with my data and auto pays and financial records by doing multiple installs and uninstalls.  My solution is to \"eat\" my copy of Q12 and switch to Wells Fargo Bill Pay.  It's free for me ($6.95/mo for some)and I don't have to pay for yearly Quicken bombs and $9.95/mo for Bill Pay.

In addition to a new look, it offers stability, ease of use and more Internet integration than ever before.\nInstallation was easy. You can either upgrade your existing Windows or do a clean install. I recommend a clean install so be sure to back up your important data (e-mail, accounting programs, etc.) You can boot from the CD and it will pretty much to the rest. Installation takes about 30-60 minutes but it was VERY easy. XP really knows what plug and play means. ALL, and I mean ALL of my peripherals were found and configured automatically.\nOnce installed, you will be prompted to activate. This was an easy and fast process. The next thing it will do is set up your Internet access. Once this is done, you are now ready to go. You will notice right away that the interface is different and very colorful. It may take a little while to get used to but once you do, you will like it. You also have an option of a \"classic\" Windows 9x view.\nWindows XP makes a lot of functions very easy. First of all, depending on your BIOS and motherboard, you can tell Windows just what to do when you press your power button. It also has built in CD burning capability, however, to delete a file from a CD-RW, you must erase the CD and then put back the files you want. A little inconvenient but a lot more stable than DirectCD. It is VERY easy to set up individual users. You can set up a personalized account for each member of the family. Also, when installing many programs, it will detect XP and ask if you want certain people to access the program. This is very nice and secure. And with Internet Explorer 6.0, you can now choose the level of cookie protection. You will be amazed on how many third party \"usage tracking\" cookies that are placed on your PC.\nBackward compatibly is very good to excellent with XP. XP ran all of my older windows based programs and MOST of my DOS games. A few DOS games worked about 80% and some not at all. I am sure that \"DOS EMULATORS\" will be available for purchase in the near future.\nWindows XP seemed designed for Internet integration. Just about every major function in XP has a tie to the Internet. And because of this, Microsoft has included a built in Firewall. It is good, but I would recommend Norton Internet Security 2002.\nFor those of you who are worried about compatibility, Windows XP makes it pretty easy to set up a dual boot. All you need is a partition created before installing. After that, Windows does the rest.\nFor those who want security, go with Windows XP Professional. Everyone else can get by with Windows XP Home. If you have a previous copy of Windows, get the UPGRADE version. It will search for a previous install or ask you for the original Windows 9.x/2000 disk to verify.\nThere is a lot more I can say about Windows XP but you just need to see it for yourself.

I was one of the early adopters of Windows 8, but immediately regretted it due to major incompatibility and usability problems, so I went and reverted back to Windows 7.  At that time, I felt it was too early to write a fair review.  I mean, for me it was a major screw up from Microsoft, but I also felt that MS had a point in producing a touch-screen oriented OS, and that I should probably wait and see if this actually was the way to go in the near future.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt and stood down from blasting them with a negative review.\nA year later comes Windows 8.1, claiming adjustments were implemented for the non-touch-screen user base, in an attempt to convince more people into adopting their new OS platform.\nWindows 8.1 is free for Windows 8 users, so I decided to give it another chance.  I figured, why waste all of $15 dollars on a new OS and not take advantage of this redeeming opportunity? So here's how it went.\n\nUpgrade process:\n\n*** Edit: Forgot to mention the upgrade path for Windows 8.1.  You upgrade from Windows 7, to Windows 8, from 32 bit to 32 bit and 64 bit to 64 bit.  Going from 32 to 64 bit requires a full/fresh install (it wipes documents, programs, etc.), not an upgrade.  Also, you can't upgrade from Win 7 64-bit to Win 8 32-bit.  Once you upgrade to Windows 8, you can upgrade to 8.1 by downloading the point release in the Microsoft Store, available as a tile icon on the Windows 8 new Metro desktop.  The 8.1 download will be available only after you have applied all critical Windows 8 post-upgrade fixes.  It may take a few restarts until you get all Windows 8 updates.  If you plan to update directly from Win 7 to Win 8.1, you will require a full/fresh install, it is also not part of the upgrade path.  end Edit ***\n\nUpgrade assistant displayed a report with potential application compatibility issues.\nNot all of the installed applications are scanned during this process, only those apps that Microsoft has registered on their database.  You have to cross your fingers for other applications on your system to work with Windows 8.1.  I suggest some investigative work prior to committing to the upgrade process, especially if one of those unreported apps is considered critical for you.\nThe initial stages of the upgrade show you the incompatible applications and drivers for Windows 8.  This was scary at first, because one of the apps was the actual antivirus software, which ironically is their own MS Security Essentials. The actual reason for the message is that Windows 8 includes its own AV software integrated with the OS called Windows Defender. Security Essentials is now a pre Windows 8 product.\nThe other two incompatible applications were the Blue Tooth and USB 3.0 controllers.  Later after the upgrade I found out that these were actually replaced with Windows 8.1 versions, but this is not clearly explained during the upgrade; at that point they were just incompatible, okay? You figure it out.  It felt a little uncomfortable, sitting in front of your screen contemplating whether these incompatibilities will impact your upgrade or not.  I could imagine a non-technical user hitting Esc or Cancel immediately after seeing this.  I saw this as a challenge, I dared Windows 8.1 to mess with my working Windows 7 setup, so I followed their directions to uninstall Security Essentials and the USB and Bluetooth drivers and continue faithfully (blindly)with the process.  After that, a Steam game was reported as incompatible and two others required patches supposedly available from their developers.  Fortunately in this case, all the games worked fine after the upgrade was completed (with all Windows updates applied).\nThe actual upgrade took approximately two hours or so (including the initial download).  It actually took longer to apply the Windows updates after the actual upgrade.  In total, it took approximately 3.5 hrs to finish the entire upgrade, and most of this time was spent \"watching paint dry\".\n\nPost upgrade issues (One major and one minor issue):\n\nMajor issue - Higher than normal CPU usage with and idle computer and abnormally high CPU temperatures (55C - 60C).  After some investigation, it was an Intel Storage Controller driver compatibility issue.  Replacing the Windows driver with the PC manufacturer's version made this issue go away.  If it wasn't for a small CPU temperature app (Speed Fan) I wouldn't have discovered the problem with who knows what future consequences.\n\nMinor issue - A third party app that was not displayed on the Windows compatibility report, no longer works with Windows 8.1.  It was not a big deal for me because the software developer has not upgraded this software for almost two years now anyway (DarkBasic Pro).\n\nPersonal gripes:\n\n- The new Metro interface - It's designed for touch screen devices, I have a Desktop.  Isn't it possible to write a piece of code to detect whether or not you have a touch screen device and adjust the Metro desktop accordingly?\n\n- Windows button - It's there, but it does not work as I believe many of us were expecting it to work, to give us the familiar Start menu with All Programs.  You still have to use the metro interface to search or browse for your programs.  You'll have to get used to it.  On the positive side, the shortcut to common system options when you right click the Windows icons is a nice plus.\n\n- File History - There is no Backup and Restore anymore.  It seems that with every Windows upgrade, a key functionality is removed from this important component.  From XP to Win 7 you lost the ability to backup to network drives, unless you purchased the Ultimate edition. Windows 8.1 replaced Backup and Restore with File History, which is limited to backing up files located in Documents, Music, Video, Desktop and Pictures folders.  You are no longer able to customize the backup to save files from other folder on your computer.  You will have to relocate folders into any of the valid backup folders.  It still saves backups on external drives only.  Shared drives or even Sky Drive are not backup options.\nThe automated backup occurs a few times during the day.  You can backup on demand, but have no control of the automated backup frequency.  The backup format is different than the format used in Windows 7.  If you used to have a backup in Windows 7 format, now you have two different sets of backups on the same drive.\n\n- Minor gripe, it feels redundant having application shortcuts on your regular Desktop and your Metro desktop.\n\nPluses\n\n- The Sports tile - It's nice to have an option to select favorite team news. The results, standings, and stats information is always up to date and quickly available.\n- The News tile was awesome until it stopped working...\n- In Metro, the option to search programs organized by most commonly used is very convenient\n- I still have my Desktop and shortcuts.\n- Windows boots a little faster and it handles CPU cycles very well.  Components are running cool and efficient.\n\nCurrent issues\n\n- News tile opens and closes and does not display news.  Currently I can't read news, although I can see the headline updates on the actual tile icon.\n\n- The lock screen actually lives up to its name.  After a while of inactivity (haven't nailed the actual time it takes before the system locks up), the lock screen remains there and you can't get past it to the logon.  The mouse cursor icon moves, and the keyboard is responding (can see Caps lock light switching on and off) but it's not possible to get to the actual log on screen. Windows does not respond to Ctrl-Alt-Del, esc keys, mouse clicks, space bar or any key combination. The only solution is to power down, and then be greeted with a message that the computer did not shutdown cleanly during power up.\n\n- Sky Drive - Stopped working the first day after I cancelled a large file upload.  There's an error message, but no option to resolve the issue.  The message shows up every time I open Sky drive, and have not been able to delete or add any more files ever since, and the message cannot be deleted. The only way to use Sky Drive is by using the ol' regular web browser method.\n\n- File Search - For some reason it takes forever to open .jpg files directly from the search results, no matter how small the file size is.  You have to select the option to open file location and then click on the file within File Explorer to get a quick response.  This issue does not happen with videos, Word documents, or PDFs.\n\nConclusion\n- It will probably take some time to get all the issues corrected. In my case, they are not really critical issues, but they are nonetheless annoying and make you feel like\nMicrosoft again gave more importance to general compatibility than to stability and usability.\n\n- It still seems to me that Microsoft is still insisting on forcing people to adopt the touch screen technologies with the Metro interface.  I insist it's still too early for that and Microsoft should adjust their OS's to accommodate to their user demands not the other way around.\n\n- It was a rocky start, but I'm okay with the current application compatibility.  As long as I can play my Steam games and use my personal finance apps, I'm a happy camper.\nIt's a keeper, for now just because I feel too lazy to go through a factory reset back to Windows 7.

I thing Kaspersky Internet Security 2011 does a great job of doing just that.\nMost of the time I do not even know it is there, (except for the pulsating \"K\" in my toolbar). Kaspersky has got to be one of the quickest most reliable Anti Virus and Internet Security out there. Of course, if you would like to know more about what it is doing, you can change the settings to keep you informed. That is another great feature, for the novice, the out of the box settings work fine, but for the more PC literate you can tweak your settings until they are just right for your level of expertise. It is very customizable.\n\nI upgraded from Kaspersky Internet Security 2010, and the 2011 version has a slicker interface, with a line that zips across like on the bottom of the screen on the original Star Trek Enterprise to let you know it is working. The addition of \"Safe Run\" to the side is something new, and really cool! It is almost like a virtual machine, without the virtual machine. There are 2 ways to run Safe Run - for applications or for websites. When you select either one, a green neon like glow appears around either your desktop or web browser to indicate it is active. What it does is isolate them from the rest of your system. So let's say you got a link and you don't trust the source, simply click on the Safe Run for Websites, your browser will open with the green glow, and you are protected. It basically works the same way for applications creating a Safe Desktop environment which allows you to open files of a questionable nature. There is also a virtual keyboard as part of the safe run component that allows you to \"type\" with your mouse on a pop up keyboard for the most security on banking sites and anything else that requires more privacy. Use this especially if you suspect there is a keylogger on your system.\n\nIt is really difficult to judge how effective any Anti-Virus software is unless you throw a known virus at it and see how it behaves. Well, (unless you are in a lab testing software) who in their right mind would infect their own machine? So, without scientific testing any opinions on anti-virus software is truly objective. I must say though that Kaspersky's anti-virus component continually runs in the background in real time protecting you against everything out there. On the main user interface page, the Protection Center ticks off the number of overall scanned files, which in my case is 15,794,775 and increasing as I type. This protection has caught a few Trojans from some websites, which it Quarantined immediately, letting me know with a big red notification telling me so. Now that's what I'm talking about, quiet until needed.\n\nThere are so many different components to Kaspersky Internet Security besides anti-virus, to review them would take so many pages so I will only comment on a few in this review. Kaspersky breaks its Protection Center down into 3 categories: Files and Private Data Protection (which includes File Anti-Virus, Application Control and Proactive Defense), System And Applications Protection (which includes Mail Anti-Virus, Web Anti-Virus, IM Anti-Virus, Application Control, System Watcher, Proactive Defense, Network Attack Blocker and Anti-Spam), Online Security (which adds Firewall, anti-Phishing and Anti-Banner to 4 previously mentioned components).\n\nThe firewall is definitely one of the best, it is triggered with a pop up message when I remote in to other machines (which I would hope it would), yet allows it because it is on the same local network. I would expect that it would be denied from an outside network, unless there were specific rules in place. The firewall is highly configurable, yet in most cases the default rules should be fine for the average user. The application control is also good at spotting activity that may not necessarily be normal for a particular application and will warn you if it is ok to proceed. I also like the region notification that you can set on your browser. It will let you know if your browser is sending traffic to places it should not be going. I found it sending traffic to Iran and just the other day Libya, which I immediately denied access to these nations. This is not turned on by default, so if you like this feature you will need to enable it.\n\nI have used Bit Defender, Norton, McAffee, AVG, Webroot, Avast, among many other Internet Security programs and I have found this one to be the best one for me. I have it on all of my Windows machines. The only thing that I dislike is the occasional hit in performance when the program performs an update, but it is nowhere near as bad as Norton. You will see a little globe in the \"K\" in your toolbar when the update occurs, so at least it lets you know what is going on if you notice a little slow down. Maybe faster servers might help, but at least it does the updates on its own every hour without any involvement from you.", "summary": "The Best Security That I've Come Across", "unixReviewTime": 1300838400}

Since I use the 3 license version, I have installed Kaspersky on my 2007 Dell Vostro 1000 laptop (1GB RAM) w/Windows XP Home, and my 2004 Dell Dimension 8300 (2.5GB RAM) w/Windows XP Pro - both with 120 GB hard drives. See below for my HP Mini 210-XXXX netbook install.**\n\nI would like to say the installation had a quirk in it so will give some helps here:\n\nTHIS IS FOR WINDOWS XP:\nAfter the install program verified and extracted files, I agreed to two separate agreements, then it checked for program compatibilty and said it would automatically remove Norton Live Update (I have Norton Systemworks but not anti-virus). Then you are told that you have to reboot \"to continue the installation\" and are given Three (3) choices:\n\n1) Reboot NOW and continue to install\n\n2) (don't reboot) Click Continue but your install might fail.\n\n3) Cancel the install.\n\nWhen you choose \"1\" it reboots then makes you agree to the same two agreements, say to automatically remove the incompatible files/programs and choose 1, 2 or 3 again.  Also all of the programs in your systray are back again after the instructions had told you to close them.\n\nIf you chose 1 again, the same thing happens over and over again -- So choose 2 AFTER the first reboot. AND I didn't think to close the programs the second time but had NO problems occurred with either computer.\n\nYou really don't want to wait to install a new version of the software because you have to update the databases from whenever the program came out -- like July of 2011 or before.  Mine took about 8 or more hours with 4 or 5 updates.  I think it didn't do them all at once.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Netbook install: I have an HP Mini 210-xxxx netbook with 1GB Memory, 250GB harddrive, Windows 7 Starter OS.\nAfter going to the website to download the software, the install was very easy, did not have any of the quirks above, only asked for agreements to the installs and, once installed, the updates were very quick.  It is a faster computer so everything was faster.\n\nALSO, I had to purchase another 1PC license of this same program to install on a new desktop with Windows 7 Premium.  It was fast and had the same type of install.  Both the new computer and the year old netbook have a different interface icon --- rectangle that looked like and old monitor and flat desktop design with icons on the front and side.  This was the same for both of my computers that use Windows 7.  The icon for the Win XP OS is round.\n\nWhat I like is the program sets everything up for you and you don't have to choose all of the settings but you can go in and do that later if you want.  There are many features and programs available -- see the information on the Amazon's product page.\n\nThe new 2012 version seems not to slow down my computers and takes care of the updates without interrupting your work. It does update faster when you are not using the computer, though.\n\nupdate w/netbook install 4-28-12", "summary": "My Third Year of Kaspersky - even better!", "unixReviewTime": 1330473600}

As long as an account is setup before trying to downloading the product, it downloaded and installed easily for me. Yes, it took time. After all, this is a bloated Microsoft product. This version of Office is sort of a hybrid, or so it feels - partly in the cloud, but mostly on your computer. That it good for people on the go and need to access documents that may have been saved at different locations on different machines or devices. Documents can be saved to the Skydrive associated with your account. In order to use this program, unlike a standard office version, you must be logged into the account you created, or a previous account that can be linked to the subscription. The subscription includes free apps (must be downloaded from the app stores) for iPhone and I would imagine Android and Windows mobile as well, which allow viewing and editing documents as well as accessing the Skydrive from a mobile device (Don't tell the boss about this).\n\nThe new look of Office 365 is more in line with Windows 8, but it is flat, colorless and dull. Microsoft does not give you many options to change it either. There are three different themes to choose from - White, Light Gray and Dark Gray. Wow! Microsoft really? I would at least have expected a light blue like Office 2007 offered. At least if White or Light Gray is chosen there is a thin line of color at the bottom status bar, with dark gray chosen this is black. The color changes based on the program being used - blue for Word, green for Excel, etc. There is also a background pattern that can be chosen which is really just in the top right hand corner of the screen. These uninteresting patterns are grey, but vary in shade based on the \"theme\" chosen. Pretty unexciting.\n\nAs far as functionality goes, Office hasn't changed that much in the last few versions, there is a customizable ribbon at the top which changes based on the tab that is chosen. Microsoft has done away with any sort of shading or shadowing to make the ribbon stand out in any way, it is incredibly flat looking, which is kind of disconcerting, and at times confusing. Clicking on \"File\" (which for some reason always has a colored box around it) slides open another screen where there are other options. This is where more of a Windows 8 look comes into play (and a little bit more color). The options are pretty much the same as in other Windows versions, just presented differently. Save As offers an option to save to the computer as well as to the Skydrive. Microsoft installs a program that loads when the computer is started that keeps the Skydrive in sync with all the documents saved there. The icon in the computer's toolbar is a cloud with a green line moving from left to right. Because it is constantly synching, there is a noticeable, but not intolerable lag when typing, as compared to a non-cloud based system.\n\nOffice 365 comes with a license for up to 5 PC's or Macs which makes the $99.00 a year (at time the of review) price a good deal if utilizing all of them, since it offers the full Office suite, 20 GB storage on the Skydrive and 60 minutes of Skype per month all included in the subscription. It does not turn out to be such a good deal if it is only being used on one PC or Mac, in which case it might be better to get a non-subscription version which costs more upfront, but can be used until its obsolescence at no charge. The other versions offer the same features without the Skype credits and less storage space on the Skydrive. Windows 7 or 8 is required to run any new version of Microsoft Office product.\n\nMicrosoft Office is pretty much the world standard for software of this type. Other software has come and gone, so it is almost essential to own some version of Office these days. While Office 365 is not my favorite version that Microsoft has created, it's not that bad either. The lack of color makes their product boring and hard to navigate, and because there is no option to change this is frustrating. Microsoft needs to put some style into its office products.", "summary": "A Lack Of Color Makes A Boring Interface", "unixReviewTime": 1380240000}

Lots of features, extras, and massive platform to do almost any home or semi-pro project. The problems with previous Pinnacle is the lack of multithread and 64 bit integration, and choppy rendering during the editing process. The Pinnacle 18 has 64 bit architecture and utilizes your computer's juice to it's fullest potential.\n\nInstallation - Took far too long. 30 minutes for installation in this optimized day in age? A non-factor, but something worth noting.\n\nInterface-  Intuitive, easy to drag and drop, cut, selecting frames.\n\nRending Capability - While it is built for CUDA (Nvidia Graphics cards), my AMD Radeon card still was able to lend some juice to rendering.\n\nEditing - Drag and drop, snip snip, import video. Relatively easy to pick up. Not being able to just drag a video from the outside is annoying. I have to import the video into the Pinnacle ecosystem before playing with it. The editing tool for video is superb. Change lighting, exposure, overlay image or text - this is like photoshop/lightroom for video editing.\n\nLive Screen Capture - Simply a win. No more searching for that right screen capture software. Integrated, easy to use, spectacular convenience.\n\nWhat I love is that recording both the video and audio (program sounds) is seamless. Not many recording programs provide this feature. Usually, you would need to use an external recording device to overlay any audio.\n\nFeatures and extras - My golly. Royalty free soundtracks, endless list of transitions and effects, countless plugins. I personally don't need them all, but you will probably find a diamond in the bucket. It can be quite a headache to surf through all those transitions and effects. Look through them all thoroughly a couple times, bookmark your favorites, and save yourself time in your video editing regime.\n\nThe Pinnacle Studio 18 jumped leaps in and bounds and showed promise with the revamped 64 bit architecture and usual plethora of features. It is far from perfect, but it does give you all the tools for home or semi-pro production.

I really disliked Vista and preferred XP still, but Windows 7 has tipped the scales...finally. Windows 7 has been reliable and it's snappier than Vista.  Windows 7 sips laptop battery power so my 1-year-old Dell XPS M1530 runs longer under Win7 than it did under Vista.  But what I really like about Windows 7 are the new and improved features it offers. Here's a list of my favorites:\n\n#1 VIRTUAL LIBRARIES\nWith virtual libraries, the special folders like Documents, Pictures, Music and Videos have all become libraries. Instead of being a physical storage location, they're indexes that point to one or many locations on the computer you're using, as well as other computers you're networked with. In a home setting, where you're running Windows Home Server, you can now easily direct file stores to your server.  Also in the home, housemates can easily see each others' data by including their respective folders in one another's libraries. When you search a library, you're searching your computer and any other computer that has folders you've added to your library.  You determine which physical location will be the default location for saving new files to your library.  This is, for me, the single best feature of Windows 7, and is an excellent reason to upgrade.\n\n#2 START SEARCH\nThe Start Search has been improved in Windows 7 so results appear instantly as soon as you click the Start button, and then either type the name of a program on your computer, or a task you'd like to perform (like, \"change my display settings\"). No more hunting folder hierarchies to find that elusive program, or spend time figuring out where Microsoft has placed something in the Control Panel. This is a tremendous time-saver.\n\n#3 AERO SNAP\nThe Aero user interface has three new tricks -- Shake, Peek, and Snap -- but only Aero Snap is a major leap forward. Have you ever tried comparing the contents of two windows together, side-by-side? It's painful to do because you have to fiddle with resizing the two windows. With Aero Snap, now all you do is grab the title bar of one window, sling it to the left, and Windows 7 will automatically resize the window to fill-up one-half of your screen display. Do the same with a 2nd window by slinging it to the right, and it'll fill-up the right-side of your display. You can start comparing two windows in...an Aero Snap. Aero Shake and Peek are cute, but not nearly so helpful.\n\n#4 TASKBAR\nGone is the Quick Launch bar that too many people didn't know existed. Now, the whole Taskbar is a quick launch bar -- drag and drop any program icon onto the bar, and you're one click away from starting the program. Also, it's so easy to move the taskbar around now. I keep it on the left vertical on my computer. Gone is the system tray, too -- Notification Area takes its place. The Action Center alerts you to anything you need to do to keep your computer working smoothly.\n\n#5 PROGRAM COMPATIBILITY\nAny program can be run in one of many compatibility modes now. Windows 7 has a wizard that will help you pick the right, earlier version of Windows under which to run an older program -- just right-click on the program icon and choose \"Troubleshoot Compatibility\". Or, You can do the same thing more quickly by right-clicking on a program icon, click the Compatibility tab, enable Compatibility mode, and select the earlier version of Windows you want to run with your program.\n\n#6 STICKY NOTES\nLess functional that the Vista Sticky Notes -- which nobody used -- but now I actually use Sticky Notes to put reminders on my Desktop. They're quick, easy, and work just like a regular Post-It note only you don't get fingerprints on your screen!\n\n#7 JUMP LISTS\nThere are two kinds -- Jump lists that let you quickly pick a task to perform, and Jump lists to quickly select a document to open and edit in the associated program. Jump lists include most recently used files, or you can pin your own files, too.  These are nice time-savers.\n\n#8 SAVED SEARCHES\nIn Windows Explorer, you can create filtered searches and then save them in your Favorites for later use. This is handy to find filtered data in the future. When you re-execute the search, it creates a dynamic results set (so your search is never stale).\n\n#9 CONTENT VIEW & ARRANGING\nAlso in Windows Explorer, two new features. Now you can arrange a folder into subdivisions by date (great for your pictures folders!). You can use the Content view to combine thumbnails of files along with details that usually are found only in the Details view.\n\n#10 USER ACCOUNT CONTROL\nMost everyone hated UAC in Vista (even though it helped to keep your computer safe). In Windows 7, Microsoft tamped down the annoyance factor of UAC. You can change your date and time without setting off UAC, for example. You can also decide whether UAC should go into secured Desktop mode whenever it does get triggered (secured Desktop is when your screen darkens and you're forced to respond to UAC's dialog box asking permission to run a program or make a change to your system). You can easily turn-off UAC, too.\n\n#11 PAINT, WORDPAD, CALCULATOR\nAll three of these utilities got updated. Wordpad and Paint have the Office-like \"ribbon\" now, and Calculator has a few new memory keys, touch sensitivity, and a Programmer view for those dealing with hexidecimals and binaries.\n\n#12 HOMEGROUP SHARING\nThis is the easiest way to share data with others in your (home) network. HomeGroup creates a password that is shared among computers, and that takes care of all the issues with user accounts, file permissions and \"access denied\" problems. This is great for unsophisticated home networks.  I made this feature last because I'm not using it -- I just think it's a great idea for inexperienced users.  Note:  all the networked computers need to be running Windows 7 to make HomeGroup sharing work.\n\nIn short, think of Windows 7 as Windows Vista done right.", "summary": "Windows 7 is Windows Vista done right", "unixReviewTime": 1256169600}

Don't ask me why Amazon doesn't show the reviews in both places for what's really the same product, with just different delivery mechanisms.  I bought the box version, if you want to know.)\n\nThis part written Dec 9, 2009 (see updated comments below)\n\nThis is of course a preliminary review (written Dec 9 based on use in the last few days). At this time one can't do more than a rough cut estimate of the tax return -- the IRS forms aren't finalized, the state forms aren't available, and of course the various income reports (W2, 1099, etc.) aren't out yet.\n\nI don't have a super complicated tax situation this year: it just requires some things that a good tax program should handle easily. So far this program seems to do just fine. I found it easy to use, and found that imports from Quicken and from TXF files worked without any problems. Schedules A, B, and D worked just fine, and the related screens were easy to use and understand. Excess FICA was calculated correctly, as was the child tax credit. The AMT calculation does of course remain weirdly complicated (once a year I mutter to myself about all politicians in DC), but the program does take care of it with no apparent problems.\n\nI used TaxCut last year -- chose it over TurboTax just because of cost, and was quite satisfied. I'm not convinced this year either that you get value for the extra you pay for TT. (Incidentally, note that if you have investment income you probably need to get TT Premium, so the price would be nearly double that of HRB Deluxe.)\n\nA warning I wrote in my review last year seems worth repeating: Don't expect a tax program to apply tax laws correctly in all circumstances; for anything at all out of the ordinary, make sure you double-check against an IRS guide or another guide like JK Lasser's. The folks who design and write and test the programs make mistakes, too. And for the same reason, give the calculations a sanity check, don't just use the program blindly, or you could get tripped up by a software bug that wasn't caught.\n\nI will update this review in Jan/Feb when I've had a chance to do more with it.\n\nUpdate Jan 29, 2010:\n\nI have now done a first complete pass on my taxes, based on W2s, 1099s, and some projected 1099s.  I also have had an opportunity to use TurboTax Deluxe (I got a free copy, legally), so have been able to compare the two products.\n\nI continue to like HRB Deluxe.  It's easy to use, and has been trouble-free.  There are a couple of things I particularly like, that might be worth mentioning.  (1) They show you when the next update is expected, so you don't waste your time running the update check until there is something.  (2) Entering info from interest paying mutual funds that might have muni income (tax-free for Fed) is simple: HRB gives you a simple way to enter the amount that's tax-free in your state, and takes care of it without hassle.  TT can also deal with this, but I don't like their way as much (they create a separate 1099 to split the income into two parts).\n\nInterestingly, TTD is also noticeably slower starting up than HRBD.  Don't know why.\n\nThe one advantage TT does have over HRB is on coverage of automated downloads: TT can download your 1099 info from a larger set of institutions than can HRB.  W2 downloads look the same between the two.  This does save some time, and could be sufficient to be a decider for some.

Thus, I have an additional 7-8 GB on my hard drive that I can use for pictures and music. This is important for me since I have thousands of photos from my trips, and while I back them up I also like to keep them on my actual hard drive so I can browse through them quickly.

You can use expose by holding the mouse on any application in the dock. Stacks allows you to go through multiple folders through the stacks window, not just opening the first folder you click. I hadn't used these features much in Leopard, but probably will now in Snow Leopard.\n\n3) QuickTime X is a major upgrade from the free version of QuickTime installed in Leopard. The new version gives you a pretty decent editing capability for film and audio clips. This came at a perfect time for me as I have some movies from a recent trip but did not yet have a good editing program. Now I do.\n\n4) Faster and smoother.

Granted 8mm is an older technology, but I needed to get the video burned to a DVD since I don't really use the camera anymore.

Watching the video tutorials has helped teach me graphics concepts that may never have occurred to me to explore on my own.\n\nThe tools in this suite have aided me in creating custom banners, graphics, and editing pictures.  I've found the process to be easy and fun.\n\nThe program is a bit slow to open, even on a PC with a 3 GHz processor and 2 GB of RAM.  Once open, however, it responds very well.  The slowness to launch seems to be standard with such programs, however, so I am not sure it is really a fault with the software or if it is simply the nature of the beast.\n\nThere you have it - an amateur's perspective.

In fact, common free photo editing software features much more functionality. I believe it is intended for people with very little experience with computers and no experience with other photo editing software. However, for the rest of us using it is mostly an annoying experience.\n\nIf you launch it by selecting a new photo and then right clicking you still cannot edit that photo as you can with basically all other photo editing software. You have to use the import functionality and import folders with photos. You edit photos by selecting them and clicking \"Edit in Express Edit\". Here you can straighten, crop, fix red eye problems, and use auto fix. However, there is no batch editing functionality, no resizing, you cannot import bit maps, no pen tool, no library of filters, no magic wand, no marquee tool, etc.  I should add that by adding photos to the tray you have some limited resizing options (small/medium/large).\n\nWindows Live Photo Gallery is a free tool photo editing tool with all those editing features and much more. I am not referring to Windows Photo Gallery which comes pre-installed with Vista and is also pretty useless. I am talking about Windows Live Photo Gallery which is free and you easily can download.\n\nAfter using an editing tool in Corel PaintShop Photo Express 2010 you click the Apply button to apply it and see the effect. When you leave the editor or go to the next photo your work is automatically saved to disk without prompting you. You can restore the old photo by opening up the editor again and pressing \"Revert to original\". Basically, Corel Photo Express 2010 automatically saves your stuff (whether you want that or not) but you can always revert back. This is good for users who don't understand the concept of file and save. However, it makes it virtually impossible to use other photo editing software in conjunction with Corel Photo Express 2010 and you are running the risk of destroying photos. Corel Photo Express 2010 will over write your work without your explicit permission one way or another.\n\nOther things that annoyed me were; it is slow, it sets itself as the default photo editor upon install without asking for your permission, the install took a long time, there are new updates very often, and you cannot use save as to save file/photo wherever you want on disk. You can only save to folders you have imported.\n\nYou can use Corel Photo Express 2010 to create little projects like a Photo Book, cards, collages, calendars, and slide shows. To get nice results you need to create these projects and then order them on-line (rather then trying to print them yourself). I thought that the functionality for automatically uploading pictures to face book or send photo emails was nifty but not essential functionality. When you upload to face book it asks you for your user name and password and creates an album called \"Corel Uploader Photos\". If you find the face book up loader annoying that functionality has some value to you but I would not pay for it.\n\nIn summary, I can maybe recommend Corel Photo Express 2010 to the computer illiterate but with reservations. For all others it is definitely a DON'T BUY.", "summary": "If you think a hard drive is 500 miles or more then this software might be for you", "unixReviewTime": 1274918400}

It had issues with crashing, but it was for hobby stuff, so I put up with it. We even tried our own green screen, but it was amateur at best. I was thrilled to get the latest version, and I hoped that many of the issues I had with the older version were solved. Wrong. Like the previous version, this one crashes at random. It took me a long time to make a 2-minute book promo trailer with still photos and background sound simply because it kept crashing. The good thing though was that at least when I started it up again, it had saved my work each time. It seemed to crash when I closed out of a dialogue box and it was auto saving.\n\nI'm running Windows 8 on my computer, and I meet all the specs from the box on my system.\n\nAnyway, here are some of the pros and cons.\n\nPROS\n-Comes with a green screen panel. Fun!\n-Includes 50 G of storage space on the cloud.\n-The interface is easy to figure out and use.\n-Installed easily, although it takes a long time!\n-Lots of effects that you can add to your photos and objects (if using still photos like a slide show)\n- Has the capability of creating 3D movies. Includes disposable pair of 3D glasses. I don't have a 3D movie to test it out.\n-The library layout is great, and it's easy to drag and drop a file into the movie and drag it around. Easy to add audio too.\n\nCONS\n-The crashes.\n-Adding still photos that are medium quality leads to disappointing results, even if they look great in other programs.\n-Transitions were a little difficult to time out the way I wanted them to.\n-The crashes.\n-The full installation takes a whopping 5.8 Gigs of space. I had a recent upgrade, or else I'd have had to pass on installing it.\n- I'm very disappointed that this version still doesn't support taking .MOV files from my digital camera and importing them for editing. I can see the video, but the audio doesn't import without going through external software for converting it to AVI.  Since it's common for people to shoot video on a digital camera, this is a huge oversight in programming. My Quick Time says my file is a MPEG-4 file which should be compatible, and I don't think I ought to have to purchase $30 converting software to convert.\n- The crashes.\n- Adding text was tedious as it didn't have a \"recently used\" box on the font color formatting or the style such as shadow, etc. So I had to either copy and paste a previous slide to edit, or I had to write down the RGB color numbers I used for the font so I could recreate it on the next slide.\n\nI really wanted to like this software. But I didn't. I did successfully create the book trailer I was trying to make, but it was a tedious process.  I would not buy this or upgrade in the future. It was slow because of the crashes, and I've given two versions of Pinnacle a go with the same issues.

So, I just file state returns on paper.\n\n\"Free\" tax softwares like TaxAct might be the thing if your return is very simple, but their better versions are almost as expensive as H&R Block at low tide, and not as good.\n\nThe 2010 version is just like 2009.

But it caused major problems with some of my other software, so I have uninstalled it for the time being.  This WordPerfect Office X5 comes with thousands of clipart images, and almost 200 digital photos.  I can't remember if it asked during installation if I wanted those installed, or if you could just access them when you wanted by using the disk.  I just know they were installed, and they all appeared to have ended up in my Microsoft Digital Image Library, and my library of photos is basically destroyed.  Even after uninstalling the Office X5, all the images are still there.  I'm obviously going to have to uninstall the Digital Image software and reinstall.  Hopefully, that will clear up the matter, because there is no longer support offered for Digital Image, and I really like Digital Image software!  I'm pretty sure all my photos are in MY Pictures, so I won't lose them, but will have to burn them just in case.  Only, I can't burn them using the Digital Image software, because I can't even find them in all that clipart.\n\nMy second reason for uninstalling Office X5 may seem trivial to some, but it it not to me.  Before getting this software, I used Microsoft Works 8 software, namely Works Word.  Comparing the Works Word with the X5, I discovered I liked the X5 word processor much better.  It offered a lot more choices.  But it had an inferior dictionary, compared to Works Word.  The dictionary of my word processor is VERY important to me.  Corel has the Pocket Oxford English Dictionary.  I don't know what the Works Word has, but it has A LOT more words, and is a far superior dictionary.  Now, the X5 software asks if you would like to use the Works Word instead of the X5, so that would make the matter seem trivial.  I figured I could use either software, depending on what I was writing.  And then figured I could probably use the Works Word dictionary with the X5, since you can use it after closing Words Work; you just keep it minimized in the taskbar. Unfortunately, however, installing the X5 did something terrible to the Works Word--the Works Word dictionary disappeared!  It was no longer under tools--it was just gone!  I tried to do a repair with the Works Word disk, but there was no change.  Hence, I uninstalled the X5, uninstalled the Microsoft Works 8, and reinstalled the Microsoft Works 8.  The dictionary was back.\n\nNow, I have not contacted Corel support about these matters yet, but intend to do so when I get the time.  Right now, I need to use a word processor with a good dictionary.  But I really want to reinstall the X5 and make it work with my other software.  As I said in the beginning of this review, it offers so much!  If there was a choice when installing about the clipart, then that problem would be easily resolved--just click \"no\".  Also, I'm guessing I could install a great dictionary that I could use at any time on my PC.  The X5 looks like such fun--I really don't want to pass it up.", "summary": "Fun Software That Didn't Work For Me . . . .", "unixReviewTime": 1289952000}

With this X4 version, Corel continues to add new features and useful enhancements, important bug fixes and crucial improvements to software stability, along with performance and speed boosts by taking advantage of Intel's and AMD's new CPUs and also GPU acceleration provided by specific Nvidia graphics processors.  One really cool performance feature offered by VideoStudio is that it has a \"Smart Proxy\" editing mode, where you can edit high-definition video in a low-resolution mode, thereby allowing you to use a slower computer without necessarily slowing down to a sluggish crawl.  These performance enhancements offer a huge advantage because many of us do not upgrade our computers frequently with the latest fastest CPU processors.  So some of the other brands of video editing software may be unbearably slow on these slower computers (even to the point of completely freezing up) while VideoStudio X4 can still zip along with a decent amount of responsiveness on slower computers.\n\nEven though I do not like how Corel has organized the user interface layout for their PaintShop Pro X4 photo-editing software, I continue to like the changes and improvements that they have made to this VideoStudio X4.  I can resize, drag, dock, and undock various windows and UI elements to suit my workspace preferences and everything seems to behave intuitively.  But as with how Corel has designed their help system for PaintShop Pro X4 software, the one aspect of the VideoStudio X4 user interface that I really dislike is that to access the help menus, I am forced to hop through intermediate menus before it launches the online help from Corel's Web site using my browser.  With both PaintShop Pro X4 and VideoStudio X4, I now just bookmark the help information URLs and access them directly from my browser instead of clicking the cumbersome help button from within the application.  Even though the latest and most up-to-date online help information can be dynamically accessed directly from Corel's Web site when using this browser approach, I would still really prefer the previous approach of at least being given the option during the installation of the software to load the full help documentation on my computer's local hard drive since that also gives me the freedom to access the user manuals and help guides when I use the software without having Internet access.\n\nI had fun using the new time-lapse photography feature.  I used a Canon Timer Remote Controller TC-80N3 to shoot a series of timer-delayed photos of the sun setting behind the mountains and another cool every-two-minutes photo series that I made last summer of a morning glory vine slowly opening up its blooms, and then I used the VideoStudio X4's time-lapse photography feature to create a video from both of these photo series that look like a sped-up time-lapse movie.  If both videos had been recorded as real-time videos, they would have been mind-numbingly boring to watch, but when sped up using the time-lapse feature, they allow everyday people like me to showcase the wonders of nature just like how the professional movies and television nature programs use time-lapse photography.\n\nThe software lets me use both standard definition and HD videos, and editing, authoring, and burning of both video types is easy.  The software is very flexible in importing videos from your hard drive or capturing them directly from your video recorders.  There are flexible options for viewing your files in different ways such as timeline or storyboard modes, which are useful for adding videos, pictures, text, audio and music tracks.  You can also trim or split your video into sections for better continuity, adding transitions and enhancing with many kinds of built-in effects.  Once you upload your video, you can trim and divide the video into clips.  Trimming is marking the beginning and ending of an entire clip, while multi-trimming is useful to divide one segment into multiple clips.  Multi-trimming is very useful for editing out various parts of a recorded video to exclude sections that are boring or extraneous.  This software's trimming functions are powerful and very easy to use, allowing me to feel like a Hollywood film director while I edit my videos to make them flow seamlessly between different scenes.\n\nAs with previous versions of VideoStudio, you can import photos to create a photo slideshow along with adding text and music accompaniment.  The software is very flexible for adding music or audio voiceovers to your video projects from a variety of sources.  You can add audio to your projects in Corel VideoStudio X4 using various methods such as adding audio files to the library from your hard drive, ripping music from a CD, or recording a voiceover clip.  You can edit the audio clips using a built-in sound mixer to adjust the volume, length and duration, fade-in/fade-out, and apply various mixing and sound filter effects to the audio tracks.  The video editor does limit you to six overlay video tracks along with your main video track, combined with up to two title tracks, a voice track, and three music tracks.  While this is less than some video-editing software that lets you incorporate many dozens of tracks, it is more than sufficient for the vast majority of everyday users (like me) who mainly work with personal videos and it is sufficient even for editing important events like videos of weddings and vacations.\n\nAfter you have finished editing your video masterpiece, you can export in a variety of common formats including FLV files for YouTube, MPG (MPEG-1/MPEG-2), AVCHD, WMV HD, Windows Media, RealMedia, AVI, and QuickTime.  You also have the option to upload your work to Vimeo, Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube.  The software can create menus for DVD, Blu-ray, AVCHD, and it offers eight Blu-ray and twelve DVD menu choices.  This X4 version also adds new 3D video capabilities.  Even though I admit that I am a 3D video editing newbie, this feature seems limited and fairly rudimentary in its 3D rendering options, but it can create some pretty cool eye-popping 3D effects and is easy to use.  This will NOT get you the kind of 3D video that Hollywood can create, but it does add another dimension of \"eye candy Wow factor\" to your videos...  Just don't expect to create your own version of an \"Avatar 3D\" movie.  3D glasses are included with the software.\n\nThe \"Ultimate\" extras that are included in this software consist of proDAD Mercalli SE video correction/stabilization software and Boris Graffiti 5.3 for text/title/graphics animation and 3D effects.  The proDAD Mercalli SE video correction/stabilization software really makes a noticeable difference to stabilize and remove the shake from my videos, which I mostly shoot hand-held.\n\nThis is a big complex software application that really requires some patience for you to slowly become more familiar with all of its features and power.  But its user interface is cleanly designed so that newbie first-timers can start editing their videos with ease without fully mastering all of its powerful features.  Fortunately, Corel also provides plenty of online help along with easy-to-use templates and more than 60 really cool special effects and more than 150 transition effects to let you experiment and try out many of its flexible options so even video-editing newbies can create a polished slick video with ease.  The software uses a nondestructive editing approach so that your original video file is not being directly modified along the way.  This also allows you to experiment, even trying out wacky ideas and special effects, turning a tedious chore into a fun playtime of creating video eye candy.\n\nBack when I was using VideoStudio X2, the software had various erratic and quirky bugs and serious stability issues; it can be disheartening to have the software freeze up after you have spent more than an hour editing a video.  Many of these problems have thankfully been resolved in this version X4; not once did I encounter a freeze-up or crash during my edits using X4.  When used on an older slower Windows Vista laptop of mine, the software can be sluggishly slow sometimes, but I prefer dealing with slower performance on a slower computer than having to deal with annoying software bugs and applications that freeze up or crash on me, so I accept the fact that I have to wait longer when using VideoStudio X4 on a slower laptop that is more than four years old.  As with any video editing software, especially when editing HD videos, your best experience will result from using a fast computer with lots of memory.  While this VideoStudio X4 lacks some of the features and has more track-editing limitations when compared to both CyberLink PowerDirector and Adobe Premiere, I think that it beats those two when it comes to multi-trim clip editing, key framing, and its best-in-class stop-motion and time-lapse animation capabilities.  And VideoStudio X4 is far easier and more intuitive to learn for a newbie compared to Adobe Premiere's dense complexity.  If this software was priced at $300, I would rate it 4 stars or maybe 3.5 stars, but with its inexpensive list price and Corel's frequent heavy pricing discounts, I rate it 5 stars because you really do get a lot of video editing bang for the buck here.  And if you are not technically adept, have some patience as you familiarize yourself with the software.\n\nAlso, Corel has released two important service pack patch updates for VideoStudio Pro X4.  After installing VideoStudio Pro on your computer, you can either download these large executable files from Corel's Web site, or from the user interface, click 'Help' and \"Check for Updates\" to download and install the service packs that way.", "summary": "Powerful video editing with great stop-motion and time-lapse animation capabilities; need patience to learn all of its features.", "unixReviewTime": 1343779200}

However, this what I thought of it.\n\nStory-Bess and George have arranged for you to vacation with one of George's friends, in a place called Snake Horse Harbor.  She owns a whale watching tour business, and when you arrive you find out that someone has vandalized her boat.  She sets to work repairing it as you question suspects to find out that a whale recently spotted in the water might be what has driven someone to wrecking Katie's boat.\n\nGraphics-In this game, they were a little hazy, but that works perfectly with the story, as the island you are on is foggy year round.  The characters were pretty much the same as the last game.\n\nSound-The music is not that upbeat.  It's rather lazy music.  Pretty much makes you think you can just take your time with this mystery.  And you can.  Although you can die, it's usually from stupidity on your part and not because someone attacked you or something.\n\nGameplay-The third person point-and-click hasn't changed, and neither has your cell phone.  As in the last game you have your cell phone to call people whenever you have a signal.  But sometimes you don't have a signal which is realistic but annoying.  The puzzles in this game are kind of hard, and they require patience and logic.  This makes the game last a little bit longer.  As in the title, I DID NOT like all the coordinations that you have to find in this game.  You have a GPS, and it seems every challenge is to find a new coordinate.  Not fun.\n\nFun-Other than that, the game's puzzles are really quite fun in spite of their difficulty.  The mystery is fun, too, as everyone has a motive to have vandalized Katie's boat.\n\nLength-The game lasted me a few weeks, but I think playing it straight through takes about 10 hours.\n\nThis is a near perfect game, but because of just a few flaws I have to take a star away.  Don't let that discourage you from getting it, though.  This is a must have for fans of the series!", "summary": "Too many coordinates", "unixReviewTime": 1260748800}

I find this to be a worthy upgrade, well worth the money. The program makes it simple to create very nice looking video projects. It may take a bit of time for a new user to master the controls, but for anyone already used to the Corel studio programs, the transition will be effortless.\n\nIt would be impossible to teach someone how to use the program in an Amazon review, so here are the basics of how it works. The Studio allows one to import files from a camera (or open them from a disk file, which is my preferred method). Then you drag the video clips from the \"library\" (a space on the screen where the files are listed) to a \"timeline\", which is an area that will allow the user to view each individual frame of the film. Dragging another clip puts it after the first (or before or wherever desired), thus creating the film. Below the film one can drag in clips (for a picture in picture effect), Titles, voice overs, and music clips. With time and patience (learning the software), even a novice can produce good video clips. The software comes with a lot of sample clips, as well as video effects, sounds, and title effects. After the project looks good inside the program, there are various ways to \"share\" the video - create a disk, upload to web, export to a mobile device, etc. I have only used the disk create option, to put out videos of my family vacations and school plays.\n\nThe help documentation is on line, and works nicely. I found it to be descriptive and useful.\n\nThe \"Burn Disc\" options has been updated. I had a bit of trouble figuring out how to get the menus right, but it actually is far more powerful than before, if a bit harder to use.\n\nNew Features:\n\n- Unlike X3, which had fixed areas of the screen, this version allows one to change the size and location of each of the various panels (like the timeline or preview area), to allow for use over a larger area. This is great for dual screens, like I have. It really frees up the workspace and makes this version much better to use if one has the displays available (and dual screens are best for any kind of video project). It took me a couple of minutes to figure out how to set everything back to the previous view (it's under the Settings / Layout Settings menu); if one wants to drag those windows back into a single monitor, there is no \"snap back\" to allow one to see the various panels - they overlay each other. But that is not a big problem.\n\n- The library panel (which contains all the raw video, audio, and pictures for the project) now has the capabilities to be organized by sub-folders, and has quick settings to filter out certain media types. The effect is that it is much easier to find the desired file in the library.\n\n- Time lapse. Provided you have the pictures taken over a period of time, you can put all the pictures in a directory and easily have the program combine them into a single sequence, which can be saved into a video for viewing. It is fairly basic, with only a couple of options, but it does provide a fast way to get multiple picture sequences into the program, which can then be used in the project.\n\n- An enhanced audio mixer view allows more capability in editing and adjusting the sounds of the video, including the capability to control surround sound.\n\n- Stop motion production allows the user to connect to a video camera and capture the images from the stop motion project directly into the program, either manually or at a time interval. This would make it simpler to create a stop motion video from a laptop. It is also possible to import the images instead of taking them in real time.\n\n- Save files in zip format from directly inside the program. This makes it nice when transferring files.\n\n- You can export the project as a template, which means that the next time you need to do a similar project, you can use that template to quickly replicate the environment. This is very useful for me because I do a lot of the same format for my kids school plays.\n\nAbout the only drawback I find with the program is that it will take a while to master for the new user; because of the powerful capabilities of the program, there are a lot of options. But that is just the way this sort of software works.\n\nHighly recommended for the home video producer.", "summary": "Worth the time and effort", "unixReviewTime": 1331769600}

Everyone in our family has had to try the feature where you select and combine items from different photos to make \"creative compositions.\" Some of ours have been very unique and inspired us to think of new possibilities for our photos, ones we couldn't get by simply photographing what we see. Instead we can create a new reality.\n\nSo what gives me pause? I can't import photos from my scanner, at least not easily, and I'm still working on that. However, this is not a huge downside for me.

Because the Office Professional suite is very expensive. The only reason I'm doing this review is because I had access to a deeply discounted purchase price via an educational licensing agreement. But if you are currently running an earlier version of Office, I can't offer a single compelling reason to sink anywhere from 220 dollars (for a product key to activate the trial versions on new PCs) to more than 400 dollars (for a version delivered on DVD).\n\nIf you have very basic productivity suite needs (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) you can consider the stripped down \"student version\" instead for much less...if your needs don't include Outlook, Access or Publisher. Alternatively, if you have an affiliation with an educational institution that has an academic licensing arrangement, you should have a access to a very reasonably priced Professional version.\n\nOtherwise, unless you're just a \"current version junkie\" who enjoys having the latest and greatest version of every application, all, I can't offer a good case for spending this much on a set of tools that looks, feels and performs almost exactly like its predecessor.", "summary": "Minor interface tweaks since Office 2007; high price makes it not worthwhile...", "unixReviewTime": 1308355200}

I experience zero problems entering and completing my taxes.  You should choose carefully to insure you have the correct software.  Last year, there was a considerable problem for those who discovered that they needed a more expensive tax preparation software..  Regardless, choose carefully.\nPros:\n-You can go step by step to make sure you have all of you deductions, credits, or payments covered and correct, or you can select the forms you wish to use.\n-One of the best features that information can be pulled from previous year's filing if done on TurboTax.  It is nice to simply check the transferred info this years end make any corrections.  You also don't have to retype the info that you use year after year. It is a good reminder for items that you entered last year and found that you will need documents.\n-If you have the info from the previous year's Turbo Tax, you can compare how you did last year with this year.  It gave me a history of how my earnings stacked up with this years earnings among other things.\n-If you miss something, there will be indicators to let you know where to go to make corrections or to enter missed info.\n-You can stop at anytime and go back to where you were or to go to another place when you reopen.\n-Does all the calculations for you and then has a review in which you will have an indication of what you need to check.\n-Easy to use and to file taxes.\n-There is an indicator to give you an idea if your return could have an audit.  It's not in concrete but does give valuable information.\n-I have used this software since it was MacIntax.  I like it and found it to be a very effective tool when going through the tax process.\nCons:\n-The \"ItsDeductabel\" doesn't have a lot of items to choose from and I found that a number of the items given to a charity were not listed.  This has been a problem for a long time.  There are not instructions on how to enter the info and continue to use the entry.  Maybe I missed it, but I knew what to do from past software.\n-There is no audit help unless you pay an additional $49.99 which is close to what I paid for the software.\n-Many times though the filing process there were notifications about the audit program.  It got tedious.\n-Safety concerns are addressed but more personal information is required.  Some would consider this problematic.\n\nI considered a different over-all score because some of the concerns I have still linger, like ItsDedutable.  Additionally, it does seem there are more sections are eliminated and a new charge for the item or a different more expensive level of Turbo Tax is required.  .\nConsidering the pros and cons, I will definitely buy TurboTax again as long as they do not eliminate the forms I need.\nWill continue to buy this software.\n-", "summary": "Still A Good Tax Program", "unixReviewTime": 1456963200}

Now they've taken things to a whole new level with ads literally BUILT INTO the GUI (Graphic User Interface: the 'skin' with which you engage with the program). An example: in the new 'refinance calculator' there is a large banner ad for CHASE BANK. The refinance calculator itself is poor and majorly inferior to free ones available online, but more on that later. I don't expect to pay upwards of $50.00 for a piece of software that contains banner ads! That is simply unacceptable. In freeware, I understand it, but not in something I paid full retail for!\n\nAdding insult to injury, INTUIT has actually removed one of the best features of previous Quicken releases, the CASH FLOW monthly chart. They've replaced it with a projected balances chart which is ugly, harder to read, and doesn't convey nearly as much information as the previous version. A line chart is inferior for the purpose, and INTUIT hasn't even managed to make the data points (low and high balance points along the chart) display the actual balance when you mouse over them. This is a miserably bad design--they've managed to take a very useful tool and turn it into garbage.\n\nThe supposed new features are junk. The refinance calculator is extremely simplistic compared to far better online versions (check out Equitrend Financial Calculators if you're looking for sophisticated, free calculators). It doesn't allow the user to enter current mortgage interest rate or PMI, and instead makes you enter the total payment and then the \"impound / escrow amount.\" If you have your mortgage set-up to be tracked in Quicken, the tool cannot incorporate that data into your analysis. You must manually enter everything. The tool also does not take into account the tax implications of your refinance. Overall it is a tacked on, basic calculator that is nearly useless.\n\nThe obligatory re-skin of the program (which INTUIT trots out each year rather than making substantial or meaningful changes) is adequate, but unnecessary. Every year they tweak fonts, colors, and layout, and design elements. This year is no exception. None of the changes make the program more efficient for the end user. I don't have a problem with utilitarian designs, as long as the underlying software is substantial. INTUIT seems to leverage much of their development budget into GUI tweaks, while doing little to improve the software itself.\n\nAnother major issue is that INTUIT cannot manage to keep their data file consistent from year to year. 2011 is no exception and required me to convert my 2010 data file. Admittedly this was much more painless than the massive difficulty many experienced with upgrading from 2008 or 2009 to 2010. I wish that the developers at INTUIT would make a forwards compatible data file type and just stick with it.\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nPROS:\n\n1) Potentially better GUI (depending on your preferences)\n\nCONS:\n\n1) Ads built into the GUI itself\n\n2) Removal of a significant feature (cash flow and balance chart)\n\n3) No substantial improvements to the underlying programs\n\n4) Added 'features' are poor quality, even when compared with free alternatives\n\n5) Requires yet another data-file conversion\n\n6) Expensive! Especially considering the ads built into the program\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\n\nWhat am I getting for my money here? If you love this version of Quicken, can you kindly explain to me why it is worth upgrading? I have yet to find a single compelling reason.

Norton has revamped their retail security lineup with the home line simplified to pretty much Norton Security with or without backup.\n\nThis application comes with licensing for 10 devices: Windows, Mac, IOS (iPhone/iPad) and Android. This should be enough for many families but maybe not all. You do not get the same features on all devices. I have Windows and IOS so I'll share my experience with these.\n\nWindows Setup:\n\nWindows Installation was faster than with older versions of Norton and was pretty painless for me. I logged into my existing Norton account (setting up a new one is not difficult). I used the key code provided to activate my subscription. This starts the term of the subscription: not the first installation. All 10 devices share the same term with this product.\n\nProduct installation on PC's is performed either by logging into the Norton account the software is registered with or downloading the software via a link in an invitation email. On IOS the software an an app in the Apple app store. When started you login to the Norton account to activate the device.\n\nI did have to restart my Windows 7 Pro desktop. The controls available are pretty basic and there are lots of on/off controls to customize how Norton works. What is missing in this incarnation of Norton Security is the ability to white-list specific directories or files. This caused some consternation for me, but more on that near the end.\n\nIn operation on Windows I feel Norton Security with Backup is less \"noisy\" than previous versions; I don't feel like I'm constantly being marketed to death. Unlike previous versions of the retail product I didn't perceive my PC running noticeably slower with it in operation. This is a very good thing! The initial full scan turned up a couple of minor items missed by my previous antivirus, but none of these were active viruses. Instead they were inactive left over pieces of already removed viruses.\n\nApplication Compatibility Problems:\n\nI use VirtualBox to run a virtual machine on this PC. When I installed Norton Security Virtualbox would not start my virtual machine instance. Virtual box seems to have problems with most recent Symantec antivirus products (including&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Norton-Small-Business/dp/B00JKZPTPC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Norton Small Business</a>). I was stuck until I upgraded VirtualBox to a version which is newer than the latest official release (as of Oct. 1, 2014). It was good I found a solution because this virtual machine is critical to my business. This was the only application compatibility problem I've come across so far.\n\nSince then I found the settings for exclusions. It isn't on the security page reached via the advanced button as one might expect, but found from the small gear icon for settings at the top of the control panel. The exclusions are buried in this group of settings pages. Go to settings, antivirus, scans tab, to Exclusions/Low Risks and then finally items to exclude.\n\nBackup Use:\n\nThis is Norton Security *with* Backup. The software supports backup to the Norton cloud and to local devices. It includes 25GB of cloud storage for the 1 year term of the license. I did not use the cloud option and setup backup to a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/WD-My-Passport-Slim-2TB/dp/B00EO3031A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">WD My Passport Slim 2TB</a>. Backup completed with reasonable speed. There is reasonable control over what gets backed up. It is a nice backup tool. I feel it's important to mention that Windows 7 Pro has a good built-in backup tool that is free, easy to use and will backup to a local device. That said, Norton provides a cloud option and is even easier than the windows Backup. Is it worth the extra cost over the non-backup version? Not for me on a Windows PC, but it could be for a lot of folks.\n\nMobile Support:\n\nThe IOS app is a disappointment to me. It has a few features which do not include any virus protection:\n1) locate your phone: this placed my iPhone 4 a mile way from its actual location!!\n2) it can ring your phone: I can just dial the number\n3) it has a \"scream\" function: makes your iPhone put out an annoying siren like noise\n\nIf the \"scream\" actually sounded like a scream this app would at least have some entertainment value. If you have more devices than the 10 allowed in this product, don't waste one on an IOS device! The IOS support is pretty lame. I have read that Android devices have better support against malware, but I don't have an android device to try this out.\n\nConclusions:\n\nThis incarnation of Symantec's Norton line of retail/home security products is pretty good. It finds things other antiviruses on this computer did not and does not seem to slow things down. I had one application that had a problem, but nothing else. Backup is pretty decent. Mobile support for iPhone/iPad is poor. The user interface is simple, but does not include some advanced controls like white listing of applications, files or folders. It is probably a good tradeoff for most home users.\n\nBecause it's a great product for most people, but I had an application problem and the IOS app is poor I'm giving it 4 stars.", "summary": "The NEW Norton Generation, DECENT Backup, BREAKS VirtualBox, WEAK IOS App", "unixReviewTime": 1413244800}

Since earlier this year, they've all enjoyed using a digital camera and Windows Movie Maker to create movies, especially Lego-based movies using Lego-built characters, vehicles and movie sets.  Anime Studio seemed like something they'd enjoy using.  Okay, and I'll admit I was intrigued, too.\n\nIn reality, I think the program offers a lot of value for the money, but the implementation for a \"Debut\" program -- one where no prior knowledge of animation is required or expected -- left a lot to be desired.  Although the makers offer a very thorough tutorial to help new users explore the program, I found it to be tiresome switching back-and-forth between the PDF-based, 41-page tutorial document and the actual program.  I prefer the more elegant way of learning a new program where the program itself uses wizards to hand-hold me through the learning process.  For instance, when I learned Sony Vegas Movie Studio earlier this year, its wizards got me using a program that is certainly no less complicated than Anime Studio, and perhaps is more so.  Whereas I continue to enjoy learning how to use Vegas, my enthusiasm for Anime Studio waned quickly.\n\nMy older, pre-teen daughter and I were both frustrated at the lack of context-sensitive help or menus in Anime Studio.  I like programs that let me right-click anywhere I happen to be, and a context-sensitive menu pops up with appropriate suggestions for what I'm doing at that moment.\n\nI will credit Anime Studio Debut as being a \"fun\" program.  My pre-teen daughter especially has enjoyed manipulating the template characters that come with this program, giving herself and her siblings a lot to laugh at.  My daughter hasn't tried using the Users' Guide to learn the program -- her learning so far has been by trial-and-error.  If the authors of this program could see my daughter interacting with their program, they could see why a PDF Users' Guide tutorial isn't what's needed for this \"Debut\" program.\n\nI am concerned that Anime Studio crashed a LOT while we've used the program on an otherwise stable Vista laptop computer.  If you install this program, I suggest monitoring the Reliability Monitor (in Vista and Windows 7) to see how reliable your computer currently is, and again how reliable it is after you've installed and begun using Anime Studio Debut.  (To find the Reliability Monitor, click the Start button, then type \"Reliability\" in the Start Search textbox to find the monitor).\n\nSUMMARY:  I think Anime Studio Debut offers a lot of value for the money.  I've spent nearly as much money on stupid kids' games that weren't nearly so interesting to play with.  The functionality of this program is pretty deep.  Where the program comes up short is not on the functionality it has, but in how new users must go about learning how to use those functions.  For a \"Debut\" program, there is a lot that can be done to make learning Anime Studio Debut easier to do.", "summary": "An arduous learning curve, it's suitable only for the highly motivated", "unixReviewTime": 1257984000}

It is generally not hard to install, though some systems may have programs installed that interfere, so it's best to close out everything else that is running before starting the installation. If you have X5 and are satisfied then there's not much reason to upgrade - Winzip, the program that began as popular shareware, is an addition to X6 that most people won't really need. WordPerfect Office is compatible with MS Office/Word formats so you can exchange files between the two, and there is similar functionality. Each suite has its strengths and weaknesses depending on the needs of the user. WordPerfect is more affordable since it doesn't have the market dominance that MS Office has. For those really on a tight budget there is the OpenOffice program that can be obtained for free online from Sun MicroSystems. That one handles the basics well but lacks a lot of extra features and options that you can get in the commercial Office suites. For those who are in need of a suite that includes resources for word processing, presentations, spreadsheets, file management, Internet integration, and more, I would recommend considering WP Office X6 - if you have a recent PC model. If your PC is pretty old it might not handle the latest software so well, so you should check the recommended system specs before getting the software. Corel has done a nice job keeping the Word Perfect tradition going strong, as Word Perfect was the 1st word processing application I ever used, back in the MS-DOS era!

The other major selling point is kind of the opposite side of that coin, namely Kaspersky doesn't pop up all the time with annoying messages that either ask me to do things or tell me that it's done something.  It simply loads in the background whenever I boot the system and quietly does its job.

There are excellent instructional videos for the advanced effects, particularly 3D, on the website.\n\nThe other problem I had is that the software locks up a lot. You can cure it by shutting down the computer but that gets frustrating after awhile. I also had trouble consistently loading my videos into the editor. To be fair, this may be due to the way my videos are stored. My camera is the Canon HR10, which stores the video on small discs. Sometimes I could load a file perfectly. The next time, the same file wouldn't load.\n\nSo, I recommend this software if you're serious about making great looking movies. If you just want to share the family video, it may be overkill. The problems can be overcome, and the videos I made came out looking great.", "summary": "Great Creativity Potential, But . . .", "unixReviewTime": 1325030400}

It can't be.  The interoperability with Office 2003 and 2007 alone makes it higher than that.  After all, people who get Office 2008 are commonly those who have used the Windows version of Office and need to continue working with those files.  Say what you will about iWork, it's not perfect in that arena.  When dealing with school work and business assignments that call for these features, it's just not acceptable to deal with anything but the best, and in those arenas, Office reigns supreme.\n\nA lot of this is based on my personal experience.  It really boils down to four things.\n\nOFFICE 2008 IS EXTREMELY SLOW.  I don't even mean slightly laggy.  I mean SLOW.  TO the point you wonder if anyone did any QA on it before releasing it.  They're not even bloated apps either, not even Entourage, so it's boggling as to why the apps are as slow as they are.  Excel is by far the worst offender in the bunch.\n\nOFFICE 2008 IS EXTREMELY BUGGY.  I speak more to Word and Excel than Powerpoint or Entourage.  Excel is known to lock up after a fashion.  Word has frozen on me on more than one occasion, the latest being right at the closing stages of a book I'd written (obviously unacceptable).\n\nOFFICE 2008 IS EXTREMELY CONVOLUTED.  If you've used 2003, you know it's a matter of memorizing toolbar and menu positions.  If you've used 2007 you know it's getting familiar with the Ribbon, mostly.  2008, I don't know what they were thinking.  The Toolbox just takes all of the needed features and bulks them under a clunky structure that makes it difficult to get to the simplest of tasks.  I know they plan to fix this with 2011, and I certainly hope they take note of what they did with 2007 and 2010, because 2008 feels archaic even now.\n\nOFFICE 2008 IS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE.  Given it doesn't include a full flavor of Outlook, and how clunky, buggy, and slow it really is, and given the fact that iWork is significantly lower, it's confusing to me why Microsoft feels the need to price this so high.\n\nIN summary, I recommend it for its interoperability, but ONLY if you need that.  If you're just trying to compile docs for school and your own files, choose iWork instead.  The only thing you lose is mail, but the built in Mail app is more than enough for the majority of applications.  Entourage is a decent mail application - especially for syncing with OWA - but it's no Outlook.", "summary": "It's Office.  But you need to be aware of some things.", "unixReviewTime": 1280534400}

I liked that so much functionality was bundled together: virus protection /detection, phishing protection, maintenance and backup all in one. I bought licences 2008 through 2013 and especially liked when the option to buy it for multiple devices was introduced. In 2014, shopping around to find a good renewal price, I learned Norton was pushing renewals to Security, that 360 was being phased out. I went with Security and remained happy; from my perspective, I couldn't tell any difference except for the product's name change. This year I was approaching the deadline to renew and was still trying to find a discount. I've learned that software is an item that can vary widely in price; it's not unusual to find it from 3rd parties for as much as 75% less than buying from the manufacturer. Obviously, I jumped on the chance to get the 10 Device version of Security free to evaluate. However, I'd have happily bought it for the price it was being offered at that day (still that price today). I like everything about the product, but have some issues with the degree of preplanning and extra steps necessary to not pay full price, but that's my hangup. For convenience, Norton will happily store account information and automatically walk customers through the annual renewal process for which they bill whatever the full price is at the time. Personally, I hate software renewals setup to auto bill and download. Therefore, I don't agree to it and choose to do it manually. Norton doesn't make it as easy. In the last few years I've become accustomed to using Norton's removal tool to get it off each device on the day I'm going to review. Then I do a complete install of the latest year's version and reconnect each device to my Norton account. It's a hassle, plain and simple, but worth it to me to save some money. People whose time is worth more than mine can avoid the hoops I jump through to save a buck; just sign up for Norton's EZ-PZ auto renew process. In the years that I've been using Norton, I've not had any intrusion, virus, etc issues. Some fiends that use freeware have experienced the opposite; one's pc was completely taken over because he proceeded to a site Norton would have warned me away from.

I.e., many will have to pay more to get the forms they need.  (But, Turbo has since \"backed off\").  Being retired, my taxes are relatively simple.  But, I didn't want to get in the middle of this controversy.  I was about ready to buy Turbo when H&R offered a really cheap, about $15 deal, through Amazon.  So I thought I would take a chance and try it.  Normally, I would pay about $30 for Turbo \"on sale\".\n\nThe first thing I noticed was that HR is pretty \"Spartan\".  The GUI is not as nice.  It doesn't ask as many questions.  I also felt it was a little lacking in explaining some things.  Also, when you try to update it when you start it up, you get a message saying when the next \"FED\" update will occur (which was usually many days away).  I don't know if HR was ever updating to fix it's OWN bugs.  With Turbo, you get an update about every time you launch.\n\nSo, I entered my data and got a number for a small refund.  I then had the bright idea of running the same date through the 2013 version of Turbo I had, recognizing that there could be differences just due to tax law changes.  There was a difference of about $60 so I thought I would try to figure out where it was but I couldn't and didn't want to spend too much time.  With HR, I didn't seem to find the nice summary sheets that Turbo generates.  Maybe it's me.  Then, I noticed that when I tried to print out some forms, they didn't print correctly.  Turbo has always done a good job printing.\n\nSo, I'm thinking I should just \"pay the $2\" and buy Turbo again.  They do have a 60 day return guarantee.  On Amazon, I found that if you're a Prime member, which I am, you could purchase Turbo Deluxe for $29 so I downloaded and entered my data.  Turbo DID get exactly the same refund as HR, but, the GUI and Q&A was again more satisfying than that of HR.  I really didn't need any extra forms so the \"upgrade\" issue didn't apply to me.  I didn't have any problem importing data or any problems with Turbo as some have reported.\n\nSo, barring some other problem with Turbo, I'll probably go back to them next year.  I don't really mind paying a little extra for stability, reliability, and usability.  Also, the normal price of HR Deluxe is more than I paid this year.  I would say that it \"worked\" in my case, but, I just don't have the confidence in it that I had with Turbo.  Perhaps, that's mostly because of the skimpy user interface rather than incorrect calculations.", "summary": "It's Okay, But I'm Going Back to TurboTax", "unixReviewTime": 1423094400}

In a nutshell, this means that you can infinitely reduce or enlarge an image with NO distortion, and still have money in your pocket. Other reasons? I have about 2500 fonts, and the font navigator is fantastic for finding just the right typeface. The screen capture software is of little use to me, but for folks who need screencaps from games, movies, etc., it might prove very useful. For fontaholics, obsessive clip art collectors, and beginners, the program comes with fonts and a nice starter pack of clip art so you'll be ready to start playing right away.\n\nI have to admit, I'm not crazy about the interface. It's about on the same level as Photoshop for confusion, but there seems to be a trade-off in graphics programs: The more a program can do, the more complicated the buttons and menus. I only caught on as quickly as I did because I have used other programs for years, and knew to keep looking when I couldn't find or duplicate a certain function. Fortunately you'll never really be on your own.\n\nWhat's great about Corel is that they have so many tutorials and great product support. Even if you've familiar with other graphics programs, you'll find new features to explore, and if you're unsure of something, you can always find help for it. You won't find the plethora of third-party books, classes and online tutorials like with Photoshop, but with Corel's resources and/or a rudimentary knowledge of other programs, you probably won't need them. This will require more effort, but for me the end results were worth it.\n\nWhile I don't feel that this program is a serious competitor for Photoshop, it's a GREAT, less expensive alternative.

In general, Corel's VideoStudio is less frustrating than any other software.\n\nIf you are new to VideoStudio, there is a complete PDF file you can download from the site which includes full instructions on using the video.\n\nFrom product line point of view, Corel VideoStudio has all the basics, not a lot of bells and whistles that are hard to learn.

After you are done, it can be easily exported to YouTube, FaceBook, Flicker...etc. Or you can burn your own DVD, or Blu-Ray disks.\n\nBy the way, editing HD videos requires a very powerful PC system, this is especially true when you are dealing with the highly compressed AVCHD videos. My system configuration is: Core i7 processor, 12 GB ram, Window 7 64-bit, 1GB video card, two SATA-2 drives. I have no problem to advance AVCHD videos frame by frame for precise editing, or use mouse to fast forward AVCHD videos for quick preview...etc. Also, the rendering time is fast. During rendering, my CPU usage can go up to 90%. If you see frame drop, out-of-sync between audio and video, color bleaching, software is slow to response to your mouse clicking, or video editing process is not smooth...etc, before blaming VideoStudio software, you may want to check your hardware system first.\n\nSo far, I have done couple home videos and created some AVCHD disks. I am very happy with the latest VideoStudio X7. Comparing with previous version, this X7 version runs much faster.\n\nThough I have long experience with VideoStudio, I would definitely recommend this software to beginners.

Definitely worth $20. I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.\n\nPLOT - 5/5: Nancy is invited by socialite Lori Girard to ride West on a historic train in hopes of solving a centuries old mystery. Basically, a rich man named Jake Hurley supposedly left a huge treasure somewhere, only nobody has ever been able to put together all of the clues he left and find it - thats where you, as Nancy, come in. Cause she can solve anything, right? Right. This is a commonly used plot in the ND series, but it was very well executed by Her Interactive. There is the perfect balance of mystery, romance, excitement, history, a bit of spookiness, humor - just about everything you could ask for. A good Nancy Drew game is nothing without a good plot, and this plot ranks up there among the best!\n\nCHARACTERS - 5/5: The characters in this game are a huge improvement over the lackluster characters in SOTOC #12. Each one has their own personality and they're all fun to interact with. Lori Girard is a ditsy socialite who's desperate for attention, Charleena Purcell is a big time romance writer who we met in Secret of Shadow Ranch (She's a little annoying IMO), John Grey is the host of ghost chaser show, but his character doesn't really do anything, Tino Balducci is a hot-shot detective who got his big break when he just happened to be in the right place at the right time, and Frank and Joe Hardy are, as always, fun to talk to and very helpful. My favorite character in this game was Fatima from the gift shop - she was soo funny! \"It's FATIMA, with an F, none of that freaky PH stuff!\" Hahahahaah!\n\nSETTING - 5/5: The train was very beautiful. Very antique and a bit creepy at times, it fit the time period when it was built perfectly. All of the train cars were really well done. The gift shop and Copper Gorge was nice, too. The morgue was bit creepy - as it should be, but there wasn't much to explore there. And the desert at the end was very life-like. You could tell that a lot of work was put into this game. I only wish that there was more to explore at Copper Gorge, but we can't have everything I guess.\n\nPUZZLES - 4.5/5: The puzzles in this game were a lot harder than the last one. Which is good, cause the last game was pretty easy. Some of the puzzles were really easy and repetitive (all those pipes!), and some were really complicated. Plus there were some puzzles that were really simple but just hard to do. It was a good balance between easy and hard. I used a walkthrough for this game a lot more than the last game, because some of the puzzles (like those dolls) were just too confusing for me. But overall the puzzles were really good!\n\nIS IT CHALLENGING?: Yes, especially the first time you play it. On a scale of 1 to 5, I'd give it a 4, but if you're really good at puzzles it might not be so hard for you.\n\nENDING - 5/5: I'd say that the maze at the end is pretty easy, but the memorizing part (for me, at least) was challenging. I died more than a few times trying to figure it out. But the culprit was really unexpected and had an interesting motive. The escape at the end was like a roller coaster, I just thought it was awesome! Very well done!\n\nFinal Score:\nPlot: 5\nCharacters: 5\nSetting: 5\nPuzzles: 4.5\nChallenge: 4\nEnding: 5\n= 28.5 divided by 6 = 4.75 rounded to 5 stars", "summary": "Next Stop, Adventure!", "unixReviewTime": 1283817600}

However, my hopes were dashed immediately after installation.  I installed the program on a fairly new machine running a fresh installation of XP-SP3.  Despite a problem-free installation, I noticed that I lost my Internet connection afterwards.  I discovered this while attempting to activate the program.  The application stated there was a problem with my Internet connection, but didn't realize it was the culprit.  I adjusted the firewall settings until I was able to restore Internet connectivity, however, a non-savvy user might have a harder time figuring out the problem, and they're the ones who need this type of application the most.  The program also displayed a bunch of pop-ups for firewall rules and real-time protection notifications, sometimes several at once.  I quickly opted to operate the firewall in \"silent mode\", which is supposed to limit notifications and create rules automatically, however, I still received quite a few pop-up notifications before they, thankfully, eventually diminished.  I then tried the update feature.  The update process was simple but it required two successive reboots to complete.\n\nI finally got the program tamed, however, there were still some exisitng issues.  System resource impact wasn't too bad. Web browsing was fast and pages loaded quickly, although it takes quite a bit of time for web access to become available when starting Windows.  I also frequently lost web access and had to restart the browser several times to restore.  I also noticed a few extra seconds delay during startup and shutdown, but nothing alarming.  The scanning and malware engine seems pretty good and fast.  There is no right-click context menu scan, a major flaw.  In other words, no way to manually scan individual files, such as downloads, without scanning the entire system. The interface is otherwise clean with easily reachable menus/sub-menus.  The program can be completely or selectively disabled.\n\nI feel the installation process is too problematic for the average user.  The default firewall settings are too restrictive and all of the initial pop-ups can be pretty confusing and irritating.  I also feel the lack of context-menu scanning and the frequent loss of network connectivity are serious minuses.

I was one of the early adopters of Windows 8, but immediately regretted it due to major incompatibility and usability problems, so I went and reverted back to Windows 7.  At that time, I felt it was too early to write a fair review.  I mean, for me it was a major screw up from Microsoft, but I also felt that MS had a point in producing a touch-screen oriented OS, and that I should probably wait and see if this actually was the way to go in the near future.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt and stood down from blasting them with a negative review.\nA year later comes Windows 8.1, claiming adjustments were implemented for the non-touch-screen user base, in an attempt to convince more people into adopting their new OS platform.\nWindows 8.1 is free for Windows 8 users, so I decided to give it another chance.  I figured, why waste all of $15 dollars on a new OS and not take advantage of this redeeming opportunity? So here's how it went.\n\n*** Edit: Forgot to mention the upgrade path for Windows 8.1.  You upgrade from Windows 7, to Windows 8, from 32 bit to 32 bit and 64 bit to 64 bit.  Going from 32 to 64 bit requires a full/fresh install (it wipes documents, programs, etc.), not an upgrade.  Also, you can't upgrade from Win 7 64-bit to Win 8 32-bit.  Once you upgrade to Windows 8, you can upgrade to 8.1 by downloading the point release in the Microsoft Store, available as a tile icon on the Windows 8 new Metro desktop.  The 8.1 download will be available only after you have applied all critical Windows 8 post-upgrade fixes.  It may take a few restarts until you get all Windows 8 updates.  If you plan to update directly from Win 7 to Win 8.1, you will require a full/fresh install, it is also not part of the upgrade path.  end Edit ***\n\nUpgrade process:\nUpgrade assistant displayed a report with potential application compatibility issues.\nNot all of the installed applications are scanned during this process, only those apps that Microsoft has registered on their database.  You have to cross your fingers for other applications on your system to work with Windows 8.1.  I suggest some investigative work prior to committing to the upgrade process, especially if one of those unreported apps is considered critical for you.\nThe initial stages of the upgrade show you the incompatible applications and drivers for Windows 8.  This was scary at first, because one of the apps was the actual antivirus software, which ironically is their own MS Security Essentials. The actual reason for the message is that Windows 8 includes its own AV software integrated with the OS called Windows Defender. Security Essentials is now a pre Windows 8 product.\nThe other two incompatible applications were the Blue Tooth and USB 3.0 controllers.  Later after the upgrade I found out that these were actually replaced with Windows 8.1 versions, but this is not clearly explained during the upgrade; at that point they were just incompatible, okay? You figure it out.  It felt a little uncomfortable, sitting in front of your screen contemplating whether these incompatibilities will impact your upgrade or not.  I could imagine a non-technical user hitting Esc or Cancel immediately after seeing this.  I saw this as a challenge, I dared Windows 8.1 to mess with my working Windows 7 setup, so I followed their directions to uninstall Security Essentials and the USB and Bluetooth drivers and continue faithfully (blindly)with the process.  After that, a Steam game was reported as incompatible and two others required patches supposedly available from their developers.  Fortunately in this case, all the games worked fine after the upgrade was completed (with all Windows updates applied).\nThe actual upgrade took approximately two hours or so (including the initial download).  It actually took longer to apply the Windows updates after the actual upgrade.  In total, it took approximately 3.5 hrs to finish the entire upgrade, and most of this time was spent \"watching paint dry\".\n\nPost upgrade issues (One major and one minor issue):\n\nMajor issue - Higher than normal CPU usage with and idle computer and abnormally high CPU temperatures (55C - 60C).  After some investigation, it was an Intel Storage Controller driver compatibility issue.  Replacing the Windows driver with the PC manufacturer's version made this issue go away.  If it wasn't for a small CPU temperature app (Speed Fan) I wouldn't have discovered the problem with who knows what future consequences.\n\nMinor issue - A third party app that was not displayed on the Windows compatibility report, no longer works with Windows 8.1.  It was not a big deal for me because the software developer has not upgraded this software for almost two years now anyway (DarkBasic Pro).\n\nPersonal gripes:\n\n- The new Metro interface - It's designed for touch screen devices, I have a Desktop.  Isn't it possible to write a piece of code to detect whether or not you have a touch screen device and adjust the Metro desktop accordingly?\n\n- Windows button - It's there, but it does not work as I believe many of us were expecting it to work, to give us the familiar Start menu with All Programs.  You still have to use the metro interface to search or browse for your programs.  You'll have to get used to it.  On the positive side, the shortcut to common system options when you right click the Windows icons is a nice plus.\n\n- File History - There is no Backup and Restore anymore.  It seems that with every Windows upgrade, a key functionality is removed from this important component.  From XP to Win 7 you lost the ability to backup to network drives, unless you purchased the Ultimate edition. Windows 8.1 replaced Backup and Restore with File History, which is limited to backing up files located in Documents, Music, Video, Desktop and Pictures folders.  You are no longer able to customize the backup to save files from other folder on your computer.  You will have to relocate folders into any of the valid backup folders.  It still saves backups on external drives only.  Shared drives or even Sky Drive are not backup options.\nThe automated backup occurs a few times during the day.  You can backup on demand, but have no control of the automated backup frequency.  The backup format is different than the format used in Windows 7.  If you used to have a backup in Windows 7 format, now you have two different sets of backups on the same drive.\n\n- Minor gripe, it feels redundant having application shortcuts on your regular Desktop and your Metro desktop.\n\nPluses\n\n- The Sports tile - It's nice to have an option to select favorite team news. The results, standings, and stats information is always up to date and quickly available.\n- The News tile was awesome until it stopped working...\n- In Metro, the option to search programs organized by most commonly used is very convenient\n- I still have my Desktop and shortcuts.\n- Windows boots a little faster and it handles CPU cycles very well.  Components are running cool and efficient.\n\nCurrent issues\n\n- News tile opens and closes and does not display news.  Currently I can't read news, although I can see the headline updates on the actual tile icon.\n\n- The lock screen actually lives up to its name.  After a while of inactivity (haven't nailed the actual time it takes before the system locks up), the lock screen remains there and you can't get past it to the logon.  The mouse cursor icon moves, and the keyboard is responding (can see Caps lock light switching on and off) but it's not possible to get to the actual log on screen. Windows does not respond to Ctrl-Alt-Del, esc keys, mouse clicks, space bar or any key combination. The only solution is to power down, and then be greeted with a message that the computer did not shutdown cleanly during power up.\n\n- Sky Drive - Stopped working the first day after I cancelled a large file upload.  There's an error message, but no option to resolve the issue.  The message shows up every time I open Sky drive, and have not been able to delete or add any more files ever since, and the message cannot be deleted. The only way to use Sky Drive is by using the ol' regular web browser method.\n\n- File Search - For some reason it takes forever to open .jpg files directly from the search results, no matter how small the file size is.  You have to select the option to open file location and then click on the file within File Explorer to get a quick response.  This issue does not happen with videos, Word documents, or PDFs.\n\nConclusion\n- It will probably take some time to get all the issues corrected. In my case, they are not really critical issues, but they are nonetheless annoying and make you feel like\nMicrosoft again gave more importance to general compatibility than to stability and usability.\n\n- It still seems to me that Microsoft is still insisting on forcing people to adopt the touch screen technologies with the Metro interface.  I insist it's still too early for that and Microsoft should adjust their OS's to accommodate to their user demands not the other way around.\n\n- It was a rocky start, but I'm okay with the current application compatibility.  As long as I can play my Steam games and use my personal finance apps, I'm a happy camper.\nIt's a keeper, for now just because I feel too lazy to go through a factory reset back to Windows 7.  Three stars for now.  I'll keep you posted...", "summary": "Is Windows 8.1 a desktop computer OS?", "unixReviewTime": 1385251200}

I've been using the 2011 version and I don't see a lot of changes, but I do find that integrating data from the searches is going much smoother.  I like that this comes with six months of access to their database.  What I find is that every few years I like to do some research and update my family tree.  After a while I either get bored or I exhaust what I can get out of their database.  Then I take a break for a few years and let them add more stuff to their database.  Then I buy a new version with 3-6 months of Ancestry.com access and then do some more updating.\n\nIf that's your plan, decide how much time you want to spend.  If you are just getting started the six month subscription is nice, though three months is a good chunk of time.  The book that comes with this would be helpful for a beginner.  It might even help me if I read it, but that's not going to happen.\n\nNow if you are a serious researcher and expect to keep the online subscription going for years, there isn't a lot of savings to be had by buying this, but you do save a few dollars over the web price.  If you buy an older version the price will go down a lot and then it can be a bargain.  In fact for years I would just buy \"last year's\" software because I could get web access for 3-6 months for about $20.\n\nNote that for access to their overseas database you will pay more ($150 for six months) and for their most all encompassing subscription (which includes very extensive newspaper databases) you will be $200 for six months.

After months of frustration I've decided to throw in the towel.  Now all Corel does is load and not allow me to do anything.  Everything I click gives an error beep.  I have no interest in seeing if the latest version fixes anything because the version I paid for never really worked at a usable level.  PhotoShop, PhotoShop Elements, gimp, Serif PhotoPlus are much more viable alternatives to use.  It's so sad that such a great product was ruined by a company that puts ZERO care into their work.  Corel should just kill this product or sell it to competent developers.  I'm uninstalling this and never turning back.\n\nUPDATE 3: Despite the adware (which I believe the complaints might have reduced), I decided to try to work with this.  I really think that it's sad that a piece of software that has been around for years and has been put up as a commercial PhotoShop competitor runs much more slow than its open source counterpart.  The UI may be better but all the loading and waiting kills that benefit.  I'm going to try to see if I can deal but at this moment, I'm actually starting to appreciate the lightweight nature of GIMP.  By the way, I switched to PaintShop Pro back in the day because PhotoShop was such a huge hog!  How ironic!\n\nUPDATE 2: I'm sorry, I just had to add that I think it's really low class for software that I *PAID* for to have embedded popup ads in it!  If you want to advertise in software GIVE IT FOR FREE!  I had written the review before receiving two popup ads.  I'm sorry this is unacceptible!  I lowered the ranking one point as a result.\n\nUPDATE 1: I found a way to mitigate the sluggishness of the navigator.  If you only stick to using the \"Computer\" tab in the navigator and don't catalog any of your images, the performance is okay.  Even so, the navigator is still pretty bad.  For instance, in the image viewer, there is no way to get to the editor.  You have to exit the viewer than right-click the image in the explorer instead.  That's just bad... REALLY bad.  I've also found that X6 can be default to open directly in Edit mode.  While not ideal, it is a step forward.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nThe reason I ranked it three is because while the editor itself has improved, the navigator is just as dog slow as it has been since X3.  It is 100% useless.  The idea is that you're supposed to be able to bookmark folders in the navigator that  you can access quickly for editing and other tasks.  However, the execution of this idea is so pathetic they should have not even bothered.\n\nThis software could be five-star but the bloatware really brings it down two notches.  An ideal product would be just the editor and all of it's features alone without this albatross of bad software it is burdened to carry.  If removing the navigator were an install option, I'd gladly welcome it.\n\nNow the editor itself has really improved like I said.  If you saw my X4 review, I had said that the context menus made absolutely no sense and the UI was designed by rank amateurs.  This version appears to have addressed my earlier complaints.  While not ideal, the menus are more sensible and contexts properly applied.  The toolset is pretty sharp, I LOVE adjustment layers, and overall I'm impressed with the improvement on the edit side.  Unfortunately, the excess baggage of the Navigator (Manage Tab) weighs it down.  Just avoid it at all costs.  I really wish there was a way to just rip it out.  It's just that horrible.\n\nTo be honest the real reason I bought this was that the price was low enough (thirty) to take the risk given that the previous versions were horribly bad.  I was also getting tired of using the kludgy interface of GIMP.  The extras like FaceFilter and Perfectly Clear add to the value of the package but I would not pay much more than what I paid for it.\n\nSo in a nutshell here's why you buy PaintShop Pro X6:\n\n1) Tired of the GIMP UI\n2) Adjustment layers\n3) Heavy discount\n\nThe bottom line is what price you're willing to pay to not have to deal with GIMP's quirks.  You can get just about the same quality of image editing out of GIMP but some of its quirks are pretty unbearable.  PaintShop Pro eliminates that burden at the cost of heavy bloat.  Although it's not as bloated as PhotoShop the mother of all bloatware.", "summary": "DO NOT BUY!  DOES NOT WORK!", "unixReviewTime": 1407196800}

While there are other good OCR software solutions out there, OmniPage has consistently been considered the best. I was excited about the opportunity to work with it any while it is good software I found it to be a little ornery and quirky on occasion.\n\nInstallation was not smooth on my system. When I inserted the DVD, the installer promptly updated several support application layers such as .NET 4.0 and Microsoft's XML services layer. It was nice to see all of these things installing sequentially, but I was given no option at all about whether or not I wanted them installed, even though some of these were already installed on my system. Once it reached the actual installation for OmniPage itself, though, the installer completely hung. I was unable to eject the DVD and I finally was forced to do a hard shutdown and power-on just to get my system usable again, after which the installer allowed OmniPage to install without argument. I am not sure what happened that caused the installer hang and I was unable to reproduce it.\n\nI launched OmniPage without an active internet connection and during the start-up it asked to be activated via the internet. Also, 4 browser windows opened.\n\nOnce through the start-up OmniPage was ready to work. I selected a PDF file for processing and was given several options for translation so I selected MS Word format and let it go. It took quite a bit of time to process, and it prompted me frequently on spelling suggestions (this PDF was a laptop disassembly manual so it flagged multiple technical terms and abbreviations - my fault). I rejected all changes and let it finish. While it worked I was able to change the view to get a workflow view as well as an overview of the resulting document. The multiple views provided an interesting look at various states of my document.\n\nOnce the corrections were all through it offered to save the document and I selected a name and saved it, and the result was an empty file. I suspect the problem was that it opened the file for writing but really was not done with the conversion when the output file was created. This is a good thing to keep in mind - patience is required while conversion is running.\n\nThe software came with no printed manuals at all, just the DVD.\n\nOmniPage is powerful software and it's really straightforward to use. It has some good features and it simplifies the process of translating image files to text.

Just stunned that there is ANY gold stars - let alone more than one.\n\nLet's just say that I hold highly suspect anyone who writes a glowing review of this garbage-software.  They either are \"lite\" computer users or they are drinking the Microsoft cool-aid (or taking a mind altering drug).  I'm guessing that is was OneCare staff members looking for job security who filled out those posts speaking highly of this product.\n\nThe interface is horrible, simply bad, and you, as a user will have to spend added time \"learning\" it.  So if you're into spending those free hours of yours getting used to the way some incredibly poorly skilled user-interface designer at Microsoft has designed things - then great - everyone should have a hobby.\n\nYeah, when they say this is for 3 computers - it doesn't mean that if you buy two it is for 6 users (and so on)- like one might conclude.  Nope. Microsoft in a stellar moment of short-sightedness decided to cripple the software's ability to scale beyond 3 computers - no matter how many licenses you buy.  [actually you *can* use this on more than 3 machines; there are \"work-arounds\", but you will loose the \"uber-control\"- which is really what this is suppose to do.\n\nSo if you happen to be one of those folks who has more than 3 computers, or ever in your life expect you'll have more than 3 computers... then this is not for you (or anyone really).  -Just STUPID Microsoft, just stupid.\n\nLike being reminded of stupid things OneCare wants you to do... well good because this is a high-maintenance bit of software.  Frequently the software wants you to do things it's way - or it will not allow for the \"all clear signal.\" Flexible it is NOT.\n\nNorton/Symantec offer a competing product which is wwwwwwaaaaaayyyyyy better (and faster) than this (*&^%$#@!).  I had to figure this out the hard way.  I hope you don't.\n\nIf you think I'm joking/kidding/exaggerating...  check out how hard they make it to find the \"techical support phone number for OneCare\" - google it on the web and you'll find tons of angry users complaining about the very fact that you have to spend over 4 minutes and click 36 times through a series of help-dialog boxes (I tested this) before you can be provided a telephone number.  Yes, that's right, the user-interface is literally designed to prevent you from finding out what the tech-support number is(!) - so bad is it that when I had the Microsoft trained OneCare tech support staff member go through all the 36 clicks and so-on he got lost and couldn't find where to go to get the number (which would be to call himself more-or-less)...\n\nDon't buy this product.  That's really the kindest thing I can say about it to you.  I have to manage 7 computers for a home-office and this software has cost me more in added time using and trying to use it than I care to admit.

In the past three alone, they've gone from containing great plots with terrible gaming quality (Secrets Can Kill) to awesome plots with incredible gaming quality (Message in a Haunted Mansion). Treasure in the Royal Tower is no exception, and definitely the best Nancy Drew game to the date of its release.\n\nNancy is currently attempting to have some relaxing fun at a ski lodge called Wickford Castle in Butter Ridge, Wisconsin. Shortly after unpacking in her room, she goes downstairs to talk to the caretaker of the lodge. He informs her that Wickford's historic library has been vandalized, and is now off limits. Not only that, but another guest has reported a robbery in her room recently. Nancy decides to sneak around the castle to discover what's going on, only to discover that one of the towers at Wickford Castle was imported from France many years ago, and could hold a precious treasure that once belonged to Marie Antoinette herself. It's now up to Nancy to find this treasure before a would-be thief does...\n\nThis is probably the strongest plot to appear in a Nancy Drew game at the time of Treasure in the Royal Tower's release. I loved the setting, and the use of actual events and figures in history was an awesome idea. I learned quite a bit about Marie's character while playing the game, and reading some fictional documents that were written by her (\"fictional\" meaning they were fictional, but real in this fictional game) really made me curious as to what kind of woman and queen she truly was. The game itself isn't all that scary, but since the past three were, it's good to have one in which the scare factor was a little \"toned down\" (if they were all scary, then it'd get boring after awhile).\n\nLike the previous game, this game does have a few chores that need to be done, but they're very well-integrated into the game and don't get in the way of sleuthing. Nancy actually spends the vast majority of the game sneaking into hidden passageways, questioning suspects, and looking through confidential areas.\n\nWhile the graphics do show their age on occasion, they're absolutely phenomenal regardless. I was in awe of the beauty and detail of the castle at times. The explorable areas outside were also very nicely detailed, especially the beautiful garden (covered in snow at the time of Nancy's exploration). I won't say too much for the sake of spoiling this for those who have not played, but my favorite spot of all was the place in which Nancy finds what she and the culprit have been searching for. It was so beautifully detailed, and I could really feel all the awe that a real-life Nancy probably would have felt upon entering this hidden area.\n\nThe cast in this game was definitely stronger than the casts in the previous three (though the last one does follow very closely). The first suspect mentioned is Dexter Egan, Wickford Castle's elderly caretaker who seems to know more about the history surrounding the castle than he's admitting. He's currently trying to take care of all the issues going on singlehandedly while the owner is away on business, and believes that the culprit must be somebody else in the castle. Lisa Ostrum is a photojournalist who enjoys gossiping and being buddy-buddy with Nancy, and tells Nancy that she'd like to explore Marie's tower to find out more about the history hidden beyond the castle walls. Jacques Brunais is the handsome French ski instructor at the castle who's currently engaged to an American woman and seems to hold a very special passion for French history.  Professor Beatrice Hotchkiss is an eccentric woman who spends almost all of her time typing in her room, doing research and writing out what she calls her \"theory\" (she is also the guest who claims to have been robbed).\n\nLike the last game, this game also should be praised for the perfect choice of the culprit in the end. All four of the characters had great motives, and all of them had enough evidence pointing toward them to make me suspect them at times. However, as the loose ends are gradually tied together and the story comes to an exciting end, only one particular suspect could logically be behind all of this. The culprit's character was fantastic, and he/she is definitely one of the cruelest villains that Nancy Drew has ever faced.\n\nThe game's musical score is very nicely done. Music heard while exploring the hallways was super catchy, and definitely added to the overall \"castle\" feel in the game (in the sense that it sounded very stereotypically \"royal\", for lack of better terms). The music occasionally got a little scarier while Nancy was exploring dark passageways or in the face of danger which could cost her life if she isn't fast enough to find a way out. There wasn't a track out of place, if you ask me.\n\nWhile the previous game is a close runner-up, \"Treasure in the Royal Tower\" was definitely the best Nancy Drew game at the time of its release. Some would even say that it's still the best to date, and it remains in the top three as of the release of the Collector's Edition Fan Favorites packaging (along with \"The Secret of Shadow Ranch\" and \"Curse of Blackmoor Manor\". Between the rich sense of history, awesome casting, wonderfully detailed settings, and great soundtrack, this surely remains one of Nan's most memorable cases to date.

It's pretty annoying after a bit.\n\nOne of the catches with this software is that it is auto-renewing. So in order to activate this software, your going to have to give them your credit card number in order to get started. Personally, I feel this is an over-the-top lock-in, so to say. They should be more like your anti-virus subscription, letting you know that your subscription is about to expire, giving YOU the option of renewing instead of them just automatically renewing.\n\nSo if you put alot of work and investment into your accounting and inventory, using this software, they kind of have you and your business hostage. So you better know right off the bat if you are ready to make a true commitment to using Sage 50 Accounting software, because that is truly what it is... a commitment!\n\nIf you are a small business or very small business, this is probably an investment that you more than likely should avoid, unless you can really work it into your budget and can absolutely commit to using this software. However, if you do not need the the Payroll & Tax software, then this is indeed a good software.

The manufacturer -Chief Architect- has versions that are more for the professional than this version, and those programs are geared to making actual construction documents; however the price is substantially more.\n\n Important Note: You must be connected to internet to install the program as you must register it before you can start using it. I find this incredibly annoying and invasive.\n\nWith help of the online tutorials, a regular CAD user can get up to speed with this program in a few minutes and a novice slightly longer.  The graphic icons and pull downs arrange construction in a logical manner: build walls, then floors and roofs and then finish with electrical, plumbing and mechanical.  There are also very good tools for creating decks, plants and site conditions (although I would not suggest having the novice use the terrain editor because it could prove to be frustrating and confusing).\n\nThis software is generally ok for the cost,  and truly to develop a good \"Concept\" it's pretty good.  The extensions such as bill of materials and budgeting tools are really not needed, unless the project is limited to a deck or small home edition because standard homeowners do not generally have a frame of reference for pricing building materials.  It would almost be better to go to a home improvement store and let them provide a cost and bill of materials so that budgets can be defined and shortcomings in material can be the seller's responsibility.  The adjustability in cabinet materials is also not as good as it could be.  If the option to edit a single cabinet is presented, it should be able to be done globally so that repetitive changes are not required for each cabinet in a kitchen.  The material editor is fairly well controlled and the links to manufacturer's sites are very helpful.\n\nThe product is comparable to PUNCH software on the upper versions (ie; Professional Home Designer) but is far better than some of the comparably-priced programs by Better Homes and Gardens or other trade name home magazines.  If a real home designer wants to use a Chief Architect product, invest in the next level up.", "summary": "Very good home designer software", "unixReviewTime": 1288656000}

Nobody thinks this review is helpful?  I really don't understand why. Just because I actually like Windows 8?\n\nLike a lot of people, it was very frustrating at first to know how to do anything until I discovered this was just a shell built over Windows 7.  In fact, you can escape the top layer shell with a single click.  What I really like most is the Netflix App (the trendy name now).  So easy to watch multi-chapter movies now.\n\nBoot up is astonishingly fast - less than 15 seconds with an old Intel 80 GB SSD from a full power off state with a low cost HP desktop computer with an AMD processor.  I've never witnessed anything like this speed previously, probably three times faster than Windows 7.  I have multiple other computers in my house, but the one I have dedicated to my HDTV was well worth upgrading to Windows 8.  I am not in a rush to upgrade the others yet, especially since I know it is still Windows 7 under the outer shell.  But am I glad I upgraded the computer that is my connection to my television and the internet.  I only paid $15 directly to Microsoft for the upgrade.  But I got too cautious and didn't buy any more upgrades because I didn't like it at first.\n\nIt takes a week or so to get the hang of these boxes across your screen.  I wish they allowed the old familiar icons instead of the boxes.  Now it is just boxes and text inside - not very appealing.  Seems retro to the 1980s, not a leap forward.  But it still works.  You have to do a Google search to learn how to do anything even basic.  This is a start over as far as the outer shell is concerned.  But you can easily drop down below the outer shell and you are right back to the Windows 7 look and feel.  Well, the Control Panel is really different.  I don't much like the new way either, but it is still there more or less.  I think they are copying the Apple Tablet style where there are zillions of individuals creating Apps and charging money.  I am not one to pay for the apps.  So far I can find all the things I want for free.\n\nOther than the fast boot speed and the all the boxes on your monitor, it is still pretty much like Windows 7 underneath.  One minor annoyance.  You have to pay $10 to get the Windows Media Player that was free in Windows 7.  You can't play a DVD without it.  Well, you can - just not so easy.  You'll end up buying like did, but you won't like paying for it.  It is like Outlook used to come with Microsoft Office.  Then they split it off and charged the same price for Outlook as the entire Microsoft Office package cost.  Essentially they doubled the price if you really wanted Outlook.  Gripes me.  Divide products and double the price to get the same thing.  Thankfully I kept all my old Microsoft Office 2007 products with Outlook included.  I'll never upgrade.\n\nI bought the download version and then I created my own installation disks and installed Windows using my own disks.

I have used Norton Internet security, and then Norton 360 for years; it has served me very well. the 360 is very comprehensive as an antivirus and Network plus a password manager. It also has a feature when you do a search, for instance, to see which sites are safe, and which are known to be malicious, and shown with a green (safe) or Red (danger) icon next to the link.\n\n The upgrade procedure is a nightmare if you are trying to install it on to your PC as an upgrade, especially if you want to carry over remaining days from your current subscription of the regular Norton 360. quite a few reviewers here have complained about the same issue. The Amazon download purchase of this product gives you a link to Symantec's website, where you enter your logon credentials, and the registration Key into the form. So far, no problem. The norton downloader installs, which then downoads the Norton 360 Premiere install file. When it is done, it says it is complete, and you are given the option to activate it, which again askes you for your registation key. When you enter it, it gives you an error that it is for the incorrect product. Everybody has complained on this, and I thought I would be more successful, lol.\nYou wind up closing the window, and looking at your current Norton 360, and see no change, so you click on the upgrade link, where you can enter the reg key: same error. You look into the folder where the downoad went into (Premiere NEVER DID install) and double click the file, which then actually does something and tells you that it needs to first uninstall the old 360, and also gives your the very wise opportunity to save your user settings, like your password vault first. you reboot your PC, and all you wind up with is (No new Norton 360 Premiere), a little icon in the taskbar for the password vault. So you install it again from the downloaded install file and it is successful, and asks for the reg key once more.\n\nNow, how do you get your remaining days back from your \"old\" subscription? You go on Norton's web site and finally find out how to start a Chat session, enter your info, and get put into the Chat que. I was number 104 in line to start. It took about 45 minutes to get a rep on the chat session.  I actually put this paragraph in the wrong place..  Before I even went to start the download and upgrade, I went to Chat first to be told the correct procedure, and the rep only said that before he can carry over the remaining days, I must first install and activate the Premiere product. He actually never told me HOW to do the above correctly.\nHe also gave me a case number to use after I activated the new product, so I could continue afterwards and get the days transferred. I did that this morning, and it took another 40 minutes to go from #44 in the que to chat with a rep. He got it done for me no problem.\nSo I have 2 more PC's to do this to, and it whould work out easy I hope.\n\nI hate to sound like I'm bitchy and whiney, normally I'm not, but this really got to me. If only the instructions were clear and accurate.\nIf you have no previous product to upgrsade from, you should have no problem. Others here have advised to uninstall the old product first, but I thought I was smarter than them. Well, I AM NOT, lol.\n\nNow WHY did I not wait untill my old product subscription expired? Because I wanted to make sure the reg key I got was valid and worked. The others were right. Uninstall the old product FIRST.\n\nStill after all my complaining, I give the Nortonn 360 Premiere PRODUCT itself 5 stars. The installation/upgrade process: If it were possible, I;d give it a minus 10.

CorelDRAW X5 is a decent low-cost alternative for vector drawings, but definitely not a replacement for Photoshop.\n\nI'm happy with CorelDRAW, but a couple of things have made me say \"hmmm\".\n\nThe installation is HUGE.  The installer said that it was going to take a little more than 5GB, but I had just checked my drive space before the install and it seems like it took closer to 7GB.  It took a long time to install, so I don't want to uninstall/reinstall just to verify the numbers.\n\nFor some reason I've always been a little creeped out by Corel's EULAs (the legal gobbledygook you have to accept before installing). I don't typically read every word of of the EULA, but for some reason Corel's license agreements have always caught my attention. I'm not crazy about the notion that the application can check my system whenever it wants and report usage statistics at will and re-validate the license.\n\nThe packaging and the splash screen also make me uneasy in the way that they repeat over and over that this product is for home use only.  Even the application's title bar nags you:  \"CorelDRAW X5 (Not for commercial use) - [Untitled-1]\".  Before I installed it on my laptop I was really tempted to load it on my PC at work just to see if the black helicopters would come get me.  My wife wanted me to make up a sign for a garage sale, but I told her that would technically be \"commercial\" and that I was afraid the app would somehow detect my deceit and chop off my mouse finger.\n\nAnyway, aside from some of these weird cosmetic issues, it's a good tool for drawing. If you're not familiar with the CorelDraw family, there are plenty of resources included with the installation DVD. The PDF \"Guidebook\" is very well written and nicely presented.  If you're going to print it and use it as a desktop reference, maybe buy a new ink cartridge first, because it's very richly formatted with lots of colors.  They really did a nice job with the documentation.\n\nThere is also a user community at their website, which is a great way to get some backup support.\n\nAll in all, the functionality is very decent for the price.  There are also additional utilities included on the disc, like Corel Photo-Paint (similar to PaintShop Pro).\n\nIf you're looking for a low-cost graphics solution (as opposed to the Adobe Creative Suite of apps), then Corel is worth considering. But if you already have a background with any of the Adobe suite, then maybe consider the comparably-priced Adobe \"Elements\" applications.", "summary": "Good drawing app", "unixReviewTime": 1296259200}

There's no tutorial for its use that I can see and terminology casually tossed about is not defined (I didn't know what a scrubber was at first.)\n\nThe problem is that in a program as complex as a video editor, especially one that is nowhere as intuitive to use as some of its competitors, it is imperative that documentation exists. Clear, and simple documentation. It wouldn't have killed anyone at Corel to create a few tutorials as well.\nThe Corel Discovery Center on YouTube doesn't really  have anything you can sink your teeth into--out of 101 videos uploaded, only 18 are on video editing and most of those are for past versions of the software. The videos that do exist cover various special effects, nothing basic. If  you want to really learn, it appears you must pay for the privilege.\n\nIn addition, since the user base for VideoStudio isn't that large, there are next-to-no videos on YouTube (since that's where Corel decided to store their tutorial videos) like  you do with some other more popular video editing suites such as Sony Vegas. Typing in \"Sony Vegas Tutorial\" into the search bar in YouTube reveals 292,000 results. Typing \"Corel Videostudio Pro X6 tutorial\" shows 7,470 results. The number one hit being a review of the software, not actually a tutorial. Dismal indeed.\n\nIf Corel was serious about garnering a larger share of the market, it would ensure that there was an easy way for those using their software to easily learn how it works.\n\nNevertheless, attempting to wade through the User Guide is practically useless on the first try. Terminology, as I've already said, is introduced willy nilly along with concepts that don't tie into anything a beginner would know about editing video. What is a \"key frame\"? How does one go about finding out what it is? No clue. What is the overlay track and how is it different from the video track? No idea.\n\nEven the Getting Started Guide is of no help. The \"Understanding the Workspace\" section is a one-pager with minuscule and quick descriptions of the Capture, Edit (\"The editing stage is where you create real magic.\" Thanks.) and Share. Quick tutorials covers add on-screen narration, applying a blur with track motion and making 4 HD videos into 1 Ultra HD (4K) Movie. Very helpful in a what's supposed to be a \"Getting Started\" guide.\n\nNot until page 117 of the User Guide do you get to understand what an Overlay is (\"... used to overly clips to combine with your video in the Video Track.\" Also \"... used to insert video while keeping the audio from the main track ...\") but is then followed by \"... To make overlay clips with transparent background, you can create a 32-bit alpha channel AVI video file ...\" Huh?\n\nI would really like to know how to use VideoStudio Pro X6, but the information I initially have to go on is inadequate. I can see that there are a number of incredibly good-looking things you can do, but I have no idea what I'm doing and the documentation does not help. What little I've been able to do, I've had to figure out myself with a little help from the User Guide and I continue to tutor myself on the finer points of using VideoStudio.\n\nAll that carping aside, here are some rather good points for the software starting with an easy installation. I was running the software within 30 minutes and had been able to update it immediately after registration. Since the documentation was useless, I decided to jump right in. Let me take the time to make this observation: making copies of your original video files is recommended because, not knowing what I was doing, I really messed up a few things and had to restore from backup. Also, as the documentation says, it is a good idea to keep your video files on a specific data drive apart from the VideoStudio installed disk. Good advice since video editing can slow things down remarkably and more so when both the data and the software are in the same location.\n\nThe sheer amount of stuff that it is possible to do is immense and I think this is one reason I'm sort of flabbergasted there are no good tutorials. There are about 130 different transitions available, 34 different ways to insert a title--and with editing available for those themselves, the options are just about limitless--and 94 Special Effects that can be inserted into a project.\n\nThere is a sound mixer that allows finely-grained editing of the video sound, inserting voice-over narration tracks, inserting third-party music and modifying up to 20 overlay tracks, including the ability to change the stereo effects of the sound so as to be left or right channel heavy, if that makes sense. Or you can opt for 'Auto Music', which has a ton of ready made tracks with the proper mood it can insert at your pleasure with subfilters, and even variations. Fantastic.\n\nI haven't played with it, but I've seen the Track Motion feature that allows you to follow an object on screen with a text overlay. It is possible to slow a clip for effect or speed it up. Some of these features are just astounding: it is possible to take a long series of pictures and then combine them together to form a time-lapse movie of those photographs. I mean, there's truly an immense number of things it is possible to achieve. I just wish Corel would do a better job of documenting and teaching.\n\nBear in mind that the suggested system resource requirements aren't enough, you need quite a bit of computing horsepower to do the majority of this stuff comfortably, or be subject to long pauses and of course, even longer rendering times.\n\nIn summary, VideoStudio Pro X6 is feature heavy with high tonnage in features and capabilities and, if you're a beginner, it's going to take quite a bit of time investment to get the job done. But, as I proved to myself, I was able to dive into creating and working with a project then outputting it to a YouTube video with less than an hour's worth of experimentation and about that long of reading the User Guide.\n\n4 stars out of 5 for the software itself, for the very reasonable price (its competitors are quite a bit more expensive), but with one star taken away for the steep learning curve that Corel seems to want you to climb on your own.", "summary": "Beginners Beware: Complex, Feature-full Software", "unixReviewTime": 1373932800}

Since this TiVo feature was introduced, there has always been only brand of media burning software at a time that could transcode the TiVo video format to DVD. That started with a different company, but Roxio bought them several years back.\n\nI have to say that I have always been disappointed that Roxio has offered less functionality for creating DVDs from TiVo files than the previous company offered, but the software still works well for the core function, transcoding the video.

Maybe it is because I am speaking into a headset, maybe not, Dragon is almost always spot on with its recognition, Siri is usually close, but sometimes nowhere near what I said. Dragon gets what I am saying.\nPlan on setting some time aside to install Dragon, it takes a little while, and before using the program, a user profile has to be setup, and I highly recommend the short training that is included when setting up the profile. It took about an hour to install in the end including the installation of Visual C+ 9.0 Runtime for Dragon Naturally Speaking, updates to the program, profile creation and training.  Once it is installed, it needs to be activated.\n\nOnce it is all installed and initial training is completed, Dragon is quite impressive. Using it for straight dictation it performed flawlessly, with no errors. You can use Dragon as much or as little as you wish. You can use it to command your computer with your voice, dictate a Word document, search your computer or the web, update your Facebook status, just to name a few things. Of course in order to do that, you have to learn how to use the commands and even worse REMEMBER them! I guess if you use the program a lot it is only natural that the memorization will come easy. I found the learning curve to be a little too high for me, and simply use Dragon for dictation for emails and word documents.\n\nDragon Naturally Speaking Home Version 11 contains a headset which works with most laptop and desktop computers. I did however have trouble connecting it to my Late 2008 MacBook Pro running Windows 7 both natively and under Parallels. For some reason there was a compatibility issue with the audio port and the headset. I'm not sure why though, the plugs are standard miniplugs. I did have the input set to the headset as well. I did manage to get the software working using the MacBook's built in microphone, so all is not lost. The headset worked fine on my desktop PC running Windows 7. Make sure to position the mic in front of your mouth, and in the same position each time you use it. Also, make sure the volume control on the mic is set high enough, it should be properly adjusted during training anyway.\n\nI can see this program being a lifesaver for disabled people who have limited use of their arms or hands. Dragon is a good product, just be sure to check to see if your computer meets the minimum system requirements to run it. I did not think it hogged my resources, the computer worked normally when Dragon was running. Oddly enough, while I enjoyed using the program, I found that speaking everything can be as laborious as typing, and I guess the thrill wore off a little.

You'll need to do some tinkering with a USB key or have hardware that supports it (see comments to this review for details)\n3) You regularly work in multiple languages and need to easily switch from one to the other\n\nUnlike Vista Ultimate, Windows 7 Ultimate doesn't offer DreamScenes or any other eye candy different from its cousins Home and Pro.  In fact, if you were a fan of the Windows Vista DreamScenes, you should know that you will be losing them when you step up to Windows 7.\n\nSome very important things you need to know about upgrading:\n\n1) There are two types of upgrade:  \"in-place\" (where a Vista machine upgrades to 7 and you get to keep all your programs) and \"clean\" (where you lose all your old programs and settings).\n2) Anyone going from XP to 7 will have to go \"clean\".\n3) Anyone going from a different Vista to 7 (for example, Vista Home up to 7 Pro, or Vista Ultimate down to 7 Home) will also have to go \"clean\".\n4) Anyone going from any Home or Business Vista to 7 Ultimate can do an in-place upgrade.\n5) Enterprise Vista can only upgrade to Enterprise 7.\n6) You cannot do an \"in-place\" upgrade from 32-bit to 64-bit.\n\nIf you have to do 2) or 3), all is not lost--I'll explain in a moment.\n\nBefore you even buy a 7 upgrade for your machine, stop by Microsoft's website for two things:\n\na) download and run the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor.  Run it with every device connected to the machine that you'll ever want to use in 7.  It'll thoroughly examine your machine for any roadblocks and give you good advice about upgrading.  Even very new machines will have one or two programs that need some checking.\nb) Go to the Windows 7 Compatibility Center and double-check anything that came up negative in the Upgrade Advisor (or didn't show up at all).  This site lists detailed compatibility info on a LOT of different devices.\n\nAnything major, like a video card or sound card driver, I'd recommend double-checking with the manufacturer's website to be sure.  This almost burned me on two of the machines that I upgraded.\n\nLast, make a backup.  There's a free tool called Macrium Reflect that can do this for you.\n\nDo you have to do a \"clean\" install, but just want to carry over your user accounts and settings?  Microsoft makes a program called Windows Easy Transfer that's already in Vista (and XP users can download it from Microsoft) that will export your accounts and settings and let you import them back again.  It's very easy to use and does a good job of putting your accounts back together again, even going from XP to 7.\n\nDo you have to do the \"clean\" install, and you don't want to reinstall all your programs?  Laplink has an offer for $19.95 that will let you use a special version of their program \"PC Mover\" to upgrade one machine one time.  Read the documentation in detail.\n\nThe most important thing to doing a \"clean\" install is that in the Upgrade setup you choose \"Custom\".  Windows will take all of your major files and place them in a folder called \"Windows.old\".  PC Mover and the Easy Transfer program will use this folder to reconstruct your system from, so this is VERY important.\n\nI wish I had more space to go into detail here...bottom line is, if you plan ahead a bit, upgrading to 7 will go very easily (and if it doesn't, you'll have something to fall back on).", "summary": "Plan Before you Buy", "unixReviewTime": 1257033600}

Another 5 minutes invested, and I had concentric circles to show everyone's distance from a specific focal point.  15 minutes of effort versus 90 minutes expended last year!\n\nSecond, I wanted to create a more detailed (customized) view of an educational tour.  Piece of cake!  And I didn't have to resort to any additional graphics package, screen prints or anything.\n\nI suspect that as time goes on, I'll discover other uses, but for now I'm already content to recommend this.

And I say forced because Microsoft made sure that key features of my OS was not working anymore, including its security. So, Win7 was a brief yet not a bad altogether experience - if one disregards numerous lack of customization options and the palpable effort of Microsoft to make us abandon them yet again, that is. Such as stopping our desktop widgets from working in order to promote the \"brilliant\" Win8 tiles! Nevertheless, what I want to make clear is that I am comparing Win10 to an extensive background on WinXP and an adequate experience with Win7.\n\nALL YOUR BASES ARE BELONG TO US\nTwo words: forced updates. I was lucky enough to have opted for the Professional edition of the Win7, so when I got to switch to Win10, I received the Professional edition as well - which comes with the option to defer (yet still not pick between or even cancel) the installation of the latest updates. Currently, I am trying to ignore the Action Center notification for an nVidia update, that keeps pestering me to install it since las week. The Home edition, however, does not give the user any such option and all updates are forced onto him. Remember how after numerous \"essential\" updates in the past, our PCs encountered a myriad or mysterious problems that were never solved before the next update, months later? Yeah, there is no more avoiding these problems anymore.\n\nA PRIVACY NIGHTMARE\nFrom the initial Logging in only with a Microsoft-confirmed eMail account to the Groove Music and the Movies & TV Players amassing info on your files and personal habits, including the content of our eMails which MS \"reserves the right\" to pass on (read: sell) to unnamed third parties(!). There is no avoiding it: Win10 are a private person's worst nightmare. In a sense, Win10 are the basis of the most intrusive and abusive DRM ever to be slipped in in our computers, coupled with the most blatant disregard for a person's privacy at home. There had been an uproar even since the pre-release builds and some deactivation options are now available - but they are far from thorough and very prone to turning back on by themselves after a while. And it now begs the question: how much can one trust a company that silently downloaded Win10 to every WinVISTA, Win7 and Win8 PC without the consent of their owners?\n\nNO, IT IS NOT FASTER BY ANY MEANS!\nMicrosoft did not allow us to perform a clean install when upgrading from a previous Microsoft OS; however, using one's product Serial Number, it was possible to download the official image and burn it onto a disk (or transfer it to an empty USB). In preparation for the upgrade, I increased my system's RAM to 12GM and a few days after the initial update, I formated and did a clean install. Then I went on installing only software that was Win10 compatible. Keep this information in mind when I tell you that Win10 are SLOW. Slower than Win7 and much, much slower than WinXP! It takes forever to transfer files to and from a USB flash drive (a problem that started with Win7, supposedly to prevent data loss when removing drives insecurely, yet still with no option to toggle it on and off). What is more aggravating, it takes forever to explore folders, especially those on my second HDD, even if they were opened just a few moments ago.\nSo, why is it not faster? Is it because of an increase in cosmetic additions and aesthetic customizations? No. Absolutely no. Kindly read on.\n\nESSENTIAL CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS ARE MISSING\nThe Windows interface and Menu options look worse than Win7. Aero Glass, for some unfathomable reason, is not available. The Windows borders are not customizable (for the first time since Win95!). Quick Launch can be made to appear with some Registry editing (I would advise Googling it - carefully!) yet the icons in this DIY Quick Launch now cannot be centered in the Toolbar and they stay misaligned to the Task View button; the option of which icons and how to appear in the Taskbar is missing; whereas, this latest shinny OS refuses to learn that I do not like every shortcut to have a \"Shortcut to\" prefix to every shortcut I create - something Win98 had no problem learning after the third time I removed it on a new one.\nThere is a semi-official piece of software (no, I am not calling them Apps!) called Windows Ultimate Tweaker 4: I would recommend it as it does offer a number of options, some of which are very useful. However, one of the most important ones (specifically: which new file-templates and options to appear when right-clicking on the desktop) -you guessed it!- is missing.\nAnd do not get me started on the Start Menu!\n\nWHY MESS WITH SOMETHING THAT WORKED FINE?\nWin8 were a complete failure mainly because of their Start menu. We all loved the WinXP Start Menu, easy to use, a breeze to customize and backup when needed. Win7 improved on it, even if, quite counter-intuitively, one had to use libraries in order to add personal folders in the Start Menu. Yet, everything was at the right place. Well, not so much with Win10.\nThe Power button now looks like any other and is to be found between(!) All-Apps and Settings - and when pressed (remember that this will also be needed to be done at 2:00AM after 12 hours of working on a screen) one has to read and carefully select between the Shut Down or Restart options that appear. Every single time. With no confirmation dialog.\nThe installed software (All-Apps) are alphabetized easy to navigate - yet its folders do not respond to Right-clicking them. They are just dead.\nThe Tiles Panel, however, this is where they screwed up again: none of the tiles are customizable in other aspects than total size (resulting in beautiful icons looking ridiculous in all that empty background). Why can we not readjust the sizes of the contained icons? And yet they even failed to adjust the tile sizes correctly!\nThe Tiles Panel allows resizing but only in huge pre-set steps. We can also move and group the tiles. Some (but not all) tiles come in 4 sizes, others in 3 yet most in only 2 sizes. The step-wise increments of the Tile Panel create space for 6 small tiles in each group. (if you are asking why, I shall tell you why: because 5' screen Windows Phones can show 6-tiles, that's why!). Have less than 6 tiles in a group and the empty space is an ugly waste. Moreover, no tile under them can grow to fill the space under 6 small tiles, so, once again, more ugly wasted space.\nOh, and for some another mysterious reason, not all installed software can be pinned to the Tile Panel, even if they do appear in the All-Apps list! You have to hunt for them in your Program Files and find the executable.\n\nCOMPATIBILITY MODE IS STILL A JOKE\nDrakensang: The Dark Eye is not an old game, barely 5-6 years old and it is supposed to be Win10 compatible. At least its expansion is, and that run fine. The original game, however, refused to run under any \"compatibility mode\". Does this thing finally do anything besides reducing the resolution, Microsoft? You know, like trying running a few years old software under DirectX 9.0c or something?\n\nALL KNOWN BUGS ARE STILL THERE\nThe Recycle Bin still refuses to use its customized icons, just like with Win7. The Explorer folders are still unable to retain my Viewing preferences. And the Desktop still ...looses files (especially saved web-pages) one then has to hunt down with the Explorer (even if they are still in the Desktop folder).\n\nOverall, not a failure of WinVISTA or Win8 proportions but nowhere near as good as WinXP - or even Win7 for that matter.\n\nI am willing to accept this as a work in progress and give them 6 months to get their act together and patch things up.\nYet they should not think that they will get a free ride just because they claim to be giving it away for \"free\". Because it was not.\nWe had to exchange our perfectly working OS for it.\n\nThis goes to prove that, once more, there is no free lunch in this Universe.", "summary": "THERE IS ALWAYS A REASON WHY SOMETHING IS \"FREE\"...", "unixReviewTime": 1443225600}

I was impressed. After a few months, I found myself spending more time in the Windows 7 partition than in the OS X partition. I finally decided to swap around my partition sizes, and gave Windows 7 the larger chunk of my hard drive, while OS X was re-installed fresh and left unused on a tiny partition. I didn't miss OS X, which is interesting because I've spent many years defending OS X, and countering PC users when they bashed Macs. Still, I was a Mac user. I had Mac hardware. I was certain it was a good value anyway.\n\nSome online friends proved me wrong on that count, too. They showed me PC laptops that had more features than the MacBook, and which cost way less than the MacBook, too. I couldn't deny it: I was clinging to my Mac out of brand loyalty, and with Windows 7 on the horizon (and the RC working so well) I could see no reason why I shouldn't switch to PC.\n\nSo I did. I sold my aluminum MacBook and picked up an ASUS gaming PC. I removed Windows Vista from the ASUS and installed the Windows 7 RC as my primary operating system, and was pretty happy with it. It ran smoothly and without incident for many months while I waited for the retail release of Windows 7.\n\nJust yesterday I got my copy of Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade, and I have to say that installation went well. I was up & running in less than an hour, and had my previous Windows Backup restored to my new OS within another 40 minutes. I did have to spend a little time re-downloading some things like Firefox and Thunderbird, but those things are to be expected with a fresh install. The cool thing is that Windows 7 remembered that the RC I was running was an \"upgrade\" from a legitimate Windows Vista installation, and so I wasn't bugged, prompted, or tasked with proving my ownership of Vista. It just *knew* and went ahead with the installation.\n\nOnce installed, activation was simple and took a few seconds online. You need not fear MS activation now, as they're a lot less touchy than they were when Windows XP first showed up.\n\nSo what do I like about Windows 7? On a really basic level, I like that I can play Direct X games, where the Mac was a little short in the gaming department. But that aside, I like the availability of software, the new features like the improved Taskbar, Windows Peek, and the Aero environment. Sidebar gadgets are nice, too. Windows also did a good job ripping off the \"Sticky Notes\" application from the Mac, and I use that quite a bit.\n\nThe big negative for most people in switching to Windows 7 will be the lack of an email client. For me it's no big deal because I use Mozilla Thunderbird (free and open-source). For people used to Windows Mail or Outlook Express, you'll either have to switch clients, or make a purchase.\n\nBest of all, Windows 7 is not a resource hog. I gained a lot of performance going from Vista (the original OS in my ASUS laptop) to Windows 7 RC, and the retail release is no different. Things work better, and Windows 7 takes advantage of my 4GB of RAM. It helps to be running 64-bit, though. It's a good thing Microsoft included both 64-bit and 32-bit DVDs in the case. No mail-in upgrades, here!\n\nIf you're used to OS X, but want to come into the PC world where things cost less and you get more features, by all means consider Windows 7 the stepping stone to do just that. After seeing the pricing on the newest MacBooks this week, and the limited features compared to what I currently own, I have to say that now is the right time to consider that switch to PC.", "summary": "Good Enough to Switch from Mac to PC", "unixReviewTime": 1256256000}

I learn best by doing, and you certainly are doing a lot here.  This is far better than any books or cds you could ever buy.  And in some ways, it could very well be better than a classroom.\n\nYou are in full control of your learning and you do it without worrying about remembering a lesson.  You do each lesson feeling like you just forgot everything, and then realize days later, you know phrases for situations in your life, or simple items that you come across. It is highly impressive.\n\nThe difference here is all visual.  You see a boy eating an ice cream cone, and you know how to communicate anything that could relate to the sex and age of a person, the act of eating,  food and the amounts or sizes etc.  The program refreshes a variation later on, which could be a woman drinking soda, and you know the difference with the appropriate and specific communication.\n\nYou interact in many ways with the program, including speech recognition.  It will even pause until you say the phrase correctly.  All of a sudden, you are presented photos, no words, and if it's a girl walking a dog... you are speaking spanish telling the program what you are looking at.\n\nThis is great for any age, and I highly recommend it for children.  It should be in all schools as well.  I have no attention span to speak of, but this kept me going, wanting to learn more.  I still have more to go, but I hope to afford the Italian version as soon as I can... which leads to the only negative aspect... the price.\n\nFor the most part, it's worth the price, but, not fair for most.

I will install them on laptops whose drives are easily switched out post-clone, so not to disturb the original drives.  In short, clone original drive, switch it out, pop in a new drive, clone back to that drive, then partition, then put Win8 in its own partition, then switch out again.  This is one dangerous OS.  The reviews later than mine here for 1/10/13 report more horrors post-installation than I'd have imagined.  The laptops I bought for this were Dell Latitude 6530, 6510.  The other Dell laptop with an easily switched-out-drive is the D630.  But its memory is expensive.  Memory for the 6530 and 6510 runs only about $35 per 4 GB. In short, Win8 will NEVER be on a mission-critical machine, and NEVER be on a mission-critical original internal drive.  Comparable Precision models are 2400, 4400, 6500 (which uses same internal HDD as the 6530), 6600-6700.  Precision models are more expensive.  Dell's memory is easy to change (except on the D630, where the DIMM A module is below the keyboard, lol).  So if you're debating whether to install Win8, get a used Dell laptop in dellauction, DFS, or Dell Outlet.  If it's after January 31 when you want to install, don't upgrade at all.  The real cost of this upgrade is in the HUNDREDS of hours' frustration you'll have in trying to learn and use it.  For that reason, I won't install Win8 until maybe a year from now, or whenever reports of it regaining sanity and stability, come out.\n\nPartition size should at least be 80 GB, because Win8 might impose a recovery/restore file.  That file is at least 22 GB, which is the Win7 file size.  Atop that, you need space for the Recycle Bin, paging file, other junk.  So figure 80 GB or 60 GB at smallest, for a Windows 8 partition.  Put all your other programs and files elsewhere, back up your registry regularly.  Win8 forces you to be online more often, so you are at greater risk.\n\nOriginal review follows below, before the upgrades arrived.  Those upgrades are still in their little sealed boxes, unopened.  The boxes are the size of a CD.\n\n=========\nI made Youtube videos on Win8 as 'brainouty'.  My videos aren't worth watching, but the video descriptions ARE worth reading: they contain a lot of links relevant to Win8 installation and usage, from users installing, and from computer magazines online, forums, etc.  See also my posts in PC World, which often contain links to other places.  Yeah, and maybe ignore my irritation in those posts.  I need Bible's 1John1:9 every 30 seconds, when working with Windows: sorry!\n\nOh, understand this clearly:  I'm MIFFED that I have to move to Linux, in order to avoid this OS.  I'm not an MS hater, but an XP fan -- just bought four more XP Pro OS here in Amazon.  Linux will be used for internetting and email when the support for XP ends.  That way XP security will remain, as Linux for COMPUTERS is not popularly or easily targeted by hackers.  (Android is another story.)  Besides, XP's security has matured after 11 years.  Win8's just born, and its security is untested.\n\nSo you see: I'm not an MS hater.  That said, here's the review:\n\n=======================================================\nWindows 8 pro-purchase: none, for an experienced computer desktop user.\n=======================================================\n\nMight be worth upgrading, if you like poking touchscreens; for that's the essential difference in Win8 (ignoring the new garishly annoying 'tiles' on the Start Screen which replaces the Start Menu).  If you have big screens sitting over 8\" from your face, you won't want this software.  They made Win8 for touch, to compete with Apple and Android;  so mouse or touchpad, keyboard equivalents are awful.  Gone is the easy way to shut down, close a window, open multiple windows, change options.  It's all hide-and-seek now.  Plus, the screen response is MUCH slower.  You're supposed to get the thrill of watching a 'page' turn, the screen glide horizontally.  So it's DELIBERATELY slower.  Blecch.\n\nMS chirpers boast about 'fast boot times'.  Honey, I had to DISABLE fast boot on my Win98, XP, VISTA, and Win7 machines, so I'd have enough time to select the boot menu at startup, in case something went wrong.  The last thing you want is fast boot times, for then you bypass your ability to STOP the machine from hanging up.  Go get a cup of coffee when you boot.  Every Windows system, if new or tuned, boots in a minute or so.  Depending on what other programs you have scheduled to run at start up, it can take longer.  But just wait:  Win8 will be as slow as molasses, just like every other Windows OS, after it ages with the many 'updates' you'll have to get, to fix the OS bugs.\n\nMS chirpers also boast about 'safer'.  Baloney.  IE10 and the OS had security fixes in the first week!  And there are still problems.  If anything, Win8 is more susceptible to attack, because it imposes these LIVE TILES on you at boot up, and you can't really use it well unless you sign on with a Microsoft Account you create.  In short, you're ONLINE most of the time, that's what this OS is designed for;  so, you'll be under more attack, not less.\n\n==========================================\nWindows 8 contra-purchase:  keep reading this review. :)\n==========================================\n\nA) I bought it, B) I hate it, and C) it hasn't even arrived yet.  Bought it, because of the January 31 deadline, and needed to get that product key for the Media Center so at least I can play my DVD drive so I can maybe INSTALL something after Win8 disables the drive, post-installation.  NOTE: if you install 'plain' Win8, your DVD drive will become disabled;  but if you use the PRO upgrade here, the DVD/CD drives are supposed to keep working.  Will see.\n\nB) Hate it, for 3000 reasons, most of which are covered by other reviewers, to wit:\n=======================================================\n1.  Installation is VERY GLITCHY.\n=======================================================\n\nSo be sure to clone your existing drive with Clonezilla (be sure the destination clone drive is about the same size as the original);  both Clonezilla and the destination drives (i.e., from Jacob's parts) are here in Amazon.  Expect your drivers not to work, your internet not to work (way to go, MS, disable the customer from troubleshooting your buggy installer), your programs not to work, if you install ON TOP OF the existing OS.  Better still, first partition your drive (if drive is greater than 100 GB), and install Win8 on a newly-created and formatted PARTITION.  You can do that with Clonezilla, too (which is a flavor of Linux), but most recommend you partition a Windows disk with Windows.  So maybe do that first, before you clone.  Then do a 'custom' install to install to the partition.  Oh: and keep your data on a different drive, because from Win7 forward, RESTORE and REFRESH don't exactly work as advertised.  You lose data and programs sometimes yes, sometimes no.  NOTHING BEATS CLONING.  For the clone drive is a live and bootable copy of your hard drive.  DO IT.\n\nREMOVE any anti-virus or disk management software prior to installation, if you'll not do a clean install.  The reviews I've read often report aborted installations due to those things (i.e., Kapersky, Norton, Acronis) being on the machine.\n\nMAKE SURE that UEFI boot is NOT enabled;  Windows 8 changes your BIOS, if UEFI is enabled, and you really don't want that -- it will be very difficult to recover your old system if it's enabled and you decide Win8 is not for you. Basically, a 'UEFI' is a traffic cop between your OS and your machine which stops any boot without a pre-authorized 'signature' being sent to the computer;  so, your machine is effectively DEAD. But how to do this?  First, if your machine is about a year old, you may have this problem;  even then, it seems to affect only 64-bit installations.  Google on 'uefi boot option', and then find superuser(dot)com for the most comprehensive explanation on this problem I could find.  (I can't put the link in here.)\n\nSo: if you have it, you should see something like 'Legacy' or 'UEFI' on a screen, waiting for you to select it; should be in your system setup prior to booting in Windows.  If you select/enable UEFI, then maybe you won't be able to dual-boot with some other OS, later;  because, some systems thereafter HIDE the option.  So that's a problem, for Win8 DOES NOT UNINSTALL, as the instructions to the upgrade here in Amazon, warned.  If UEFI is enabled, not sure you can even clone back, to get rid of Win8. For the UEFI option creates a hidden partition on your hard drive which runs first in the boot sequence -- and maybe you can't reformat that partition, either.  Real pain in the neck.\n\nNOTE: if you don't see a 'UEFI' option, you probably don't have it, so your computer will NOT be locked by Win8 installation.  Win8 is supposed to warn you it can't use 'secure boot', when you install: if it does, SMILE BROADLY, grateful to Heaven you're not religiously tyrannized from deciding how YOU want to use your own machine!\n\nNOTE 2: Apparently all Dell workstations and mobile machines beginning with the Latitude 6410 (or near that vintage), have this 'UEFI' option, and you CAN turn it off (by selecting 'Legacy', instead);  the UEFI thingy began with Windows 7, in 2009.  So if your machine is older than that, you don't have it;  if you don't have Win7, you don't have the UEFI problem;  and if you have Windows 7, you'd already know about UEFI, as that was an issue in Windows 7 installation. One final way to check:  do you have an 'MBR' (master boot record) partition?  If 'yes', then likely you DO NOT have UEFI, because then an option to 'enable' it (radio button next to 'UEFI' in system setup) would be present.  Whew.\n\nMAKE SURE that AHCI is enabled.  Again, settings are in your system setup prior to booting in Windows.  Older machines might not have AHCI, or might not have it enabled.  AHCI controls how your DVD drives work, versus your other storage (like, your internal hard drive).  Apparently Win8 glitches up if AHCI isn't enabled, as reported by some users on the internet.  Again, if you don't see an option to enable it, don't worry.\n\n===> What's great about this Amazon deal (hence at least one star) is that you get BOTH 32-bit and 64-bit disks.  FAR BETTER TO USE THE DISKS THAN TO DOWNLOAD THE PROGRAM FROM MICROSOFT.  Most installation complaints are by people who downloaded from Microsoft for the $15 or $40.  Many problems reported:  aborted installations with many retries;  12+ hours simply to download (for MS servers control the rate, not your IP); worst of all, the download was keyed to the computer used, so (example) if you were on 32-bit Vista at the time, you got a 32-bit Win8 keyed to THAT Vista machine.  In short, the MS download is CUSTOMIZED, not generic.  So if you value your sanity, get these disks here in Amazon, instead. Pay the extra $27-52 here, unless you love waste and pain.\n\n===> here, you get BOTH 32-bit and 64-bit, as just said.  So look: I can install Win8, yell at it, then uninstall via clone-back and install Win8 later on something else -- probably also test 64-bit (to test DOSBOX and Taos Computing's DOS emulator).  So I get two experiences for the price of one.  The 64-bit use might actually be worthwhile.  Will see.\n\n=====================================\nDVD/CD Read/Write/PLAY ISSUES, post-installation:\n=====================================\n\nAllegedly, if you're installing Win8 Pro from these disks instead of downloading from MS, your DVD drive will still work, afterwards.  I'm not taking any chances, but will download VLC player (which also works in Linux) before I shut down, post-install.  I actually plan on triple-partitioning the drive, with the existing OS first (which will likely be Vista), then Linux in some flavor, leaving a third partition for Win8. I will then custom install it to that third partition, in 32-bit.\n\nIMPORTANT:  Windows Media Player won't necessarily work in Win8.  Instead, to play DVDs, you'll need the 'free' Media Center.  To get that, you have to go online to MS and give them your email, wait for a 'product key' to be mailed to you, which you have to use AFTER installing Win8 but BEFORE January 31.  Supposed to be five per customer, but to get that, you have to use five email addresses. If you do NOT install the 'free' version prior to January 31, your product key won't work.\n\nSUGGESTION: Bite the bullet and pay for Media Center ($10!) after January 31, downloading it then from MS.  The downloaded PAID version will enable your Blu-Ray player;  the 'free' version will disable the Blu-Ray player.  LOL can MS give you more DISincentive to buy?  Did the people who designed this OS sit around a conference table with lattes, asking each other, 'how can we best alienate the customer, today?'\n\n=======================================================\n2.  COMPATIBILITY with hardware is also very glitchy.\n=======================================================\n\nAfter reading 3000 reviews here in Amazon, new egg, TigerDirect and elsewhere (i.e., in comments and in computer magazines), it seems that the following hardware is problemmatic when Win8 installs (please add comments if I missed your own hardware glitch):\n\n* HP/Compaq computer and printer hardware -- they won't allow you to back-grade to Win7, but apparently the drivers in HP when you're not YET on Win8, don't function after Win8 installation.  Lots of problems reported, here in Amazon.\n* Sony -- Sony has a lot of proprietary adjustments in their stuff, and it works or often fails when Windows installations are done.\n*Graphics Cards, Nvidia or ATI Radeon -- problems with the drivers not being compatible.\n*Touchpads -- maybe won't work post-installation.\n*PROCESSORS -- Pentium 4 won't work, but Windows 8 advisor claims it will.  Some other processors might not work, as well.  In short, your installation might abort, or after installation and shutdown you might not be able to get the machine on again, due to the processor being incompatible.  But you won't know that, nothing tells you what's the problem.\n*WEBCAMS -- Logitech in particular might not work.  Don't know if any embedded laptop webcams will work.  Driver problems.\n*ROUTERS in your house. This too is a driver problem.  Some routers really have problems with Win8, so maybe first go to your router maker's site and see if there are any known problems.  Or, Google.\n*64-bit installations are more prone to problems than 32-bit.  So if you have 32-bit now, STAY on it.  You can always change later, especially since you get both 32-bit and 64-bit installers in this Amazon-purchased package.\n*1GB-RAM machines.  Win8 is supposed to be more compatible with low memory, but Pro requires 2GB, and you really need 4GB if you want smooth operation.  It's really tough to play videos or surf with 1GB, unless you have good broadband like XFINITY.  So if you have XFINITY, reserve your 1GB machine for internet and your TV hookup, or upgrade your RAM before moving to Win8 Pro.\n*Upgrades from Windows prior to Win7 are more glitchy.  CLONE FIRST.  You can only migrate your settings from Vista, and you can't migrate anything from XP.  So that will mean lost programs, lost drivers, lost a lot of things.  When my registry died on my XP in May-June (twice), it cost me three months to rebuild the thing, for back then I didn't know about cloning.  So CLONE FIRST.  Costs $8 for Clonezilla CD (I like their $60 USB, too), and maybe $30-$100 for an external hard drive the same size as your internal drive.  WORTH IT.\n\n--->  Ask people you know, who HAPPILY installed Win8 on their machines, what brands and processors, graphics cards, etc. that they have.  Frankly, you can spend $200 and just buy a cheap netbook to try Win8, leaving your main machine alone.  Then buy the upgrade here, if you're happy with Win8 function.  If not happy, you can always sell the cheap netbook here on Amazon, or to a friend. :)\n\nDell machines seem to be the most compatible with Win8.  So I'm buying a Dell D630 to use as my test machine.\n\n=======================================================\n3.  COMPATIBILITY with software is weird and conflicting.\n=======================================================\n\nWin8 will tell you it can't handle MS Office prior to 2010, but users tell me they can even get old Office 2000 on their Win8's.  I'll be testing it with DOS Lotus 1-2-3 version 2.01, on 32-bit Win8, and other software from 2003 and prior.  That's why I got Win8, to see first-hand how bad it is.  Most of the software-incompatible complaints come from 64-bit or Adobe and Photoshop users.  Graphics display problems, colors wrong, formatting weird, colorspace problems in particular.  Probably every utility program you had pre-Win8, won't work.  Anything which makes direct calls to the hardware or to the OS, or uses context menus in prior versions of Windows, will likely not install or cause the machine to freeze.  Same problem happens in Win7, especially with respect to programs that use the context menu (meaning: the pop-up menu when you right-click, in XP, Vista, Win7).\n\nDEALBREAKER?  YOU LOSE YOUR EMAIL CLIENT after installation. Win8 is not compatible with old Win7 mail, nor Vista Mail, and of course isn't compatible with Outlook Express.  So move your mail to full Outlook, back up, then pray.  If you only use online email composition, then you might actually prefer Win8, because if you create an MS account when you first install, it will then take you through the steps to consolidate your email: but you can't compose offline.  I hate composing online, so I hate this 'new' feature.  But Outlook 2010 might work for you.  I don't like any Outlook after 2000, so will try and install that, see if it works.\n\n=======================================================\n4.  NAVIGATION in Win8 is disorienting.\n=======================================================\n\nRemember Kurt Vonnegut's 'Breakfast of Champions'?  Where the guy was in WWII Dresden, then suddenly on a planet living in a glass orb -- watched by aliens -- having no idea or control how he'd flip from one world to the other?  Win8 works just like that book/movie!  One minute you're in the desktop, doing something normal and productive, then ZAP!  You're back in the Start Screen again!  Why?  Because something you did in the desktop, actually called forth some program in the Start Screen TEMPORARILY, after which you're supposed to return to the desktop.  But, sometimes you don't.  It's kinda like going into your bedroom to pick up the socks, then you see the plant needs watering so you go to the kitchen, then you see the dishes need doing so you wash them.. and then you forgot about both plant and socks.\n\nGuess guess ugly interface schizoid operation made for XBox kiddies who have no discernment except to poke at a screen.  Just go look at the Youtube videos on Win8, watch how they navigate and use the OS, and you'll see how it works.  It's not hard to learn, it's ANNOYING to learn and even MORE ANNOYING to use.  MS hates its customers, always wants to make them play 'guess how to find me or use me' with each new OS they put out.  And in Win8, they want to control your 'experience' to seeing EASTER EGG HUNT TILES OF MS PRODUCTS when you boot up.  Really childish.  As a result, I'll gradually move to Linux.  But I still have to buy ONE copy of this garbage to learn it, in case a client asks me how to send an email or open a file, and all he has, is Win8.\n\n=================================================================================\n5.  OPERATION of value will be its desktop, which allegedly is like Win7.  But ooops: no Start Menu!\n=================================================================================\n\nA Start Menu in prior versions of Windows was handy to organize and 'park' your program shortcuts.  YOU chose where they were organized, YOU designed the folders and icons and whatever to remind YOU what and where they were, and YOU controlled how YOU wanted to see that stuff displayed.  Totally.  Well, that productive tool -- in use since Windows 95 -- is gone, in Win8.  Seriously:  it's as if MS had INTENDED to destroy the best interface features of Windows.  So of course, you can't customize the icons and background, like before.  God forbid you want to preserve your eyesight by muted shades and graphics, rather than GLARE TILES with a GLARE background, no matter what color you choose, excepting sleepy gray!  Windows 3.1, all over again!\n\nHere, the MS chirpers will chorus that many THIRD PARTY add-ins restore your Start Menu.  Not really. There are hundreds of these programs you must TRY and then INSTALL and then USE to recover some of the functionality you had.  But now you spent effort and time searching through all these programs; every update to Win8, will maybe necessitate updating these programs, too.  So guess what? Now your day is spent on tweaking and updates.. not on working.  Did someone in Redmond call an in-house meeting, on 'How To Create World Inflation. Quickly'?\n\nSo I wonder how No-Win8, will truly resemble Win7.  XP is far better than both; but Win7 happily formats DVDs; its MovieMaker 6.0 is fabulous.  Win7's Help actually helps (what a shock).  Excepting Explorer (that Win8 essentially obliterates) Win7's reorganized options are pretty decent and intuitive.  So I'm dying to see if I can override Win8's interface the way I overrode Win7, resulting in a 'classic' interface (meaning, like Win98, replete with Start Menu!) across all my (soon to be 14) Windows machines.  See my 'Vista versus Win7' thread in PC World, if you're interested in that.\n\n======================\n\nC) So my Win8 Pro upgrade will arrive in a few days, allowing me to buy a Dell D630 for Win8 installation.  Someone here in the Amazon comments said that model worked well with Win8. The Dell machine's design is fabulous -- internal hard drive, just slides out after removing two screws on the back!  Machine is for sale here in Amazon.  I made a video on it, too.\n\nAlas, the D630's memory is slow, only 800MHz.  Still, that moseying RAM fits the pokey Win8 OS:  for you are expected to SIGH or drool,  while its tiles waft lazily across the screen, just as in any tablet;  then, you again swipe, sigh, drool.. one 'page' of tiles at a time.  Oh wait: you can also type the first three or four letters of the file you want, and magically 'search' appears with the many tiles answering that description.  Hmmm.  So now you have to TYPE and SWIPE?  Sheesh.\n\nSo I won't do a more personal review, for awhile.  Then my rant here will gradually suffer edit. I did nearly six months of intensive research on Win8 installation and operation, prior to buying.  Still, would love to be wrong -- if the 'right' answer is good.  :)", "summary": "Almost pure garbage", "unixReviewTime": 1357776000}

However, thought it's not a bloated program, its abundance of tools and capabilities can be intimidating to new users.  For those who find Photoshop overwhelming and pricey for what they need, the image editor and creation program, Pixelmator, may well be a good  alternative.\n\nFor a price of $59, as opposed to $699 for Photoshop CS4, Pixelmator provides many similar editing and design features found in the much larger Adobe program. Pixelmator includes basic photo adjustment features, layer-based image editing capabilities (exposure, levels, curves, brightness/contrast, blends), artistic filters, painting and retouching tools, etc.\n\nWhat you won't get in Pixelmator is batch automation, which for  regular users of Photoshop CS is almost de rigueur for working productively in such a program. You can't even save presets for commonly used adjustments. But if batch automation in an image editing program is not high on your needs lists, then read on.\n\nInterface Design\nWhat you first notice about Pixelmator is that it's very light weight, with a well designed all-black user interface. The program's layout may be a turn off for some dedicated Photoshop users, but its stylistically fun and consumer-based design may appeal more to those accustomed to working in Apple`s iPhoto, than say in Photoshop.\n\nLike Photoshop, Pixelmator has its own tool set and similar pop-up menus for various editing functions. The program's menu bar and tool panels feel and look almost the same as what you find in Photoshop. Both programs even share similar shortcut keys. However, with Pixelmator you cannot customize shortcut keys as you can in Photoshop.  (Some menu items, though, can be given shortcut keys using Keyboard Shortcuts in Snow Leopard's Preferences.)\n\nTool Sets\nPixelmator`s tool set contains similar features found in Photoshop, including crop, stamp, eyedropper, cloning, text, and selection tools. Pixelmator has the same selection tools (Lasso, Polygonal Lasso, Magic Wand, Rectangular Marquee) as Photoshop, though how you use the tools is slightly different. In this area, one program doesn't seem better or worse than the other, for using selection tools requires lots of practice, skill, and patience.\n\nIn the case of font and character editing tools, Pixelmator is very lacking compared to Photoshop. The former program makes use of Apple`s basic Font's palette, which doesn't allow for many of the advance features of Photoshop`s character palette, which includes kerning, paragraphing, tracking and leading styles. This may be a deal breaker for designers. And though you can undo and redo adjustments applied in Pixelmator, the program doesn't have Photoshop`s History panel which provides an exact list of changes you've made to an image or design.\n\nImage Editing Tools\nA cursory look at the image editing tools (exposure, levels, curves, brightness/contrast, blends) in both programs make for another comparison. Both share similar adjustments features, but a few difference should be highlighted.\n\nThe brightness and contrast tools, for example, work very differently in each program. Pixelmator`s brightness and contrast adjustments causes lost in the shadow and highlight details of the image, whereas with the Photoshop editing tool, more details are retained.\n\nPixelmator also does not have the adjustment layers features of Photoshop, meaning that in Pixelmator many of the enhancements  you make to a photo are applied directly to the image, which is not the case with adjustment layers in Photoshop.\n\nIn the area of filters and special effects, Pixelmator includes many of the import tools found in Photoshop, including various Blur, Distortion, Noise, and Texturing tools. However, it does not include anything similar to Photoshop`s Smart Filters, which when used, among other things, provide better protection to an image. However, it does include Photoshop`s layer masking which I think is not found in Adobe's more consumer-based program, Photoshop Elements.\n\nPixelmator can open and handle PSD, TIFF, JPEG, PNG, PDF, EPS files, but it does not feature a RAW convertor, so editing RAW photos in Pixelmator is out of the question.  It also contains some unique features not found in Photoshop. One such feature includes automatic palette hiding. When you, for instance, select and open the Levels tool, existing tool palettes fade away and then re-appear after you click okay in the forefront tool. Of course, there's a preference option to deactivate this feature.\n\nAnother unique feature is the ability to send images you work on in Pixelmator directly to iPhoto and Apple`s Mail. It might be useful in future updates to have this same export feature available for Aperture 2.0 users.\n\nThe Pixelmator website does include a down loadable PDF manual  and a collection of professionally produced video tutorials by Don McAllister of ScreenCastsOnline. These tutorials cover techniques and strategies for using the program, including saving documents to the web, selective desaturation, simple cropping, image slicing, colorizing and replacing colors, and simple retouching. There's also a set of third-party tutorials on digital oil painting a photo, creating a tilt-shift effect, distorting text, and creating pop art and duotone conversions.\n\nSerious photographers and designers will quickly grow out of Pixelmator simply because it lacks some of the advance features of Photoshop for efficiency and productivity. But Pixelmator is nevertheless a very affordable program for those wanting many of basic but powerful tools offered in the Adobe program without paying the hefty price.", "summary": "An affordable alternative to Photoshop", "unixReviewTime": 1256083200}

XP was pretty solid (after service pack 2) except for all of the security holes. Every time I would need to fix an XP machine it wasn't because of something wrong with the OS itself, but because the machine had virus/spyware/trojans etc. Enter Vista. MS fixed most of the security problems but did so at the expense of performance and stability. Now with Windows 7 you get the best of both worlds. XP was released in 2001 and hardware has come a long way since then, but the OS itself remained relatively static and could only take advantage of newer hardware at a basic level. Vista was an improvement and Windows 7 handles it better still.\n\nI think Vista, although I had few problems with it, will go down as ME 2.0. At the same time Windows 7 will be XP 2.0. People will cling to it and MS will have to kill it off before people will move on to it's next offering, whatever that may be.\n\nWith that said I would highly recommend that both XP and Vista users upgrade. Unlike previous upgrades you will actually get better performance and use less resources post-upgrade. A first for MS. Security is rock solid. If XP is swiss cheese, then Win 7 is the wall of China. You no longer have to download the \"patch of the day\" from Windows Update. I haven't played around with Media Player, but Media Center is great for watching DVDs and remains pretty much unchanged from Vista. My favorite features are Jump Lists, AERO Snap (for working in two windows side by side). Networking is a bit easier (especially compared to XP). Performance is much improved from Vista and is comparable to or even faster than XP. Calculator, Paint, and Wordpad have been updated. If you are upgrading from Vista you do lose a couple of progams, namely Windows Mail and Photo Gallery. Updated versions can be downloaded from Windows Update for free. The only downside is that upgrading from XP requires a clean install.\n\nAs far as the upgrade process itself goes, it's painless. Just be sure to run the upgrade advisor before you do. All that's required of you is a product key (at the end of the installation) and activation. So all you have to do is pop the disc in, grab a good book, and before you know it you're in computing heaven.", "summary": "Windows 7: The Next-Generation XP", "unixReviewTime": 1257897600}

I can't understand why MS would dumb down their product. Also, the street names seem to have been dumbed down as well. For example, Golden Eagle Ferry Road has been reduced to Ferry Road. There are innumerable examples of this dumbing down and simpifying which only serves to confuse.\n\nThe good news: The GPS functionality has been vastly improved with voice and large visual prompts which make using the program in an automobile MUCH MUCH easier. The little car cursor in the 2005 version has been replaced by a much more visible circle with a large arrow in it indicating direction.\n\nDespite the dumbing down of the actual map data the program remains a superb mapping program with many updates since the 2004 and 2005 versions. New streets, restaurants and other points of interest are now incorporated. This program offers a truly affordable GPS guidance system for nearly all consumers without having to go to the expensive Garmin or Magellan systems. If you find yourself traveling to points unknown I cannot imagine a better solution for getting around than this product in conjunction with your notebook.\n\nA few comments about the Streets and Trips mapping software. I am familiar with the Delorme product and the Garmin product and Streets and Trips blows them both away - no contest. Instantaneous panning, zooming in and zooming out, outstanding routing software, and a plethora of other features makes Streets and Trips, by far, my favorite mapping software.\n\nOne problem I had, and hopefully this will help others who might encounter the same problem: Downloading the software into your computer does NOT automatically load the drivers for the GPS locator device! This must be done separately with the Setup disk when you first attach the locator device. Should you fail to put the Setup disk in and let your computer find the driver automatically ON THAT DISK, then your program will not recognize the locator! I wasted quite a bit of time trying to figure out what was wrong. If you don't add the drivers manually your device manager will automatically load drivers that will not be recognized by the program! I had to go into my Device Manager and uninstall the drivers that were added and then manually install the MS drivers for the GPS locator. Not an insurmountable problem, but it does require a bit of experience with computers.\n\nThe included driver software turns your USB port into a pseudo-serial communication port enabling the software to recognize the locator (only serial ports are recognized by the software). The software will not recognize the locator UNLESS it is attached to a serial (or in this case pseudo-serial) communications port. So be careful and follow the installation instructions closely. The locator is made by Pharos GPS and if you have any installation problems go to their web site for further instructions.\n\nI heartily recommend this product however be aware of the minor software and driver glitches I've described above.

I wanted to try it because speech recognition on iPad and iPhone works pretty well and saves lots of typing in text messages and emails.\n\nThe voice recognition results have been good so far. My very first test was a long, detailed email where I had to describe the history of a particular project, over 800 words total. I needed to correct fifteen words, and I was totally delighted. Speaking is so much faster than typing that even after fixing the incorrect words I had saved a lot of time. When I write something, I have to go back and edit it anyway for clarity and grammar, so changing words doesn't bother me.\n\nDragon includes lots of features for speaking commands, entering forms, etc. I haven't learned any of these. I have been using a mouse since 1985, so it is a natural extension of my hand. Same thing now with a trackpad: after 10 years I don't think about it anymore. So I just move my cursor by hand and speak the text I want to type. Dragon works fine this way.\n\nHere are my tips for getting the most out of voice recognition:\n\n  * Do the voice training. I did two full sessions, the both rated for medium difficulty. This gives Dragon the most chance to learn your voice.\n  * Pause every sentence or two. The accuracy seems higher, and you can gather your thoughts. I only pause long enough to breathe, maybe a half second, but that seems to be enough.\n  * I wish I could always follow this tip myself: don't fix every error as you see it. Keep talking, and fix the errors later. I find that fixing each error disrupts my train of thought and slows me down. Unfortunately this is alsothe way I write without voice recognition: I go back and fix each typo as I see them. Old habits are hard to break!\n  * Don't expect perfection!\n\nI'm perfectly happy that Dragon allows me to create text in about half the time. I have not experienced the technical issues other reviewers describe, even after several weeks of use. I routinely switch between internal and external microphones for other work, so I have no problem switching to the Dragon mic for dictation.\n\nFour stars for adequate accuracy, but not perfect. Not recommended for computer novices without local help, but if you know how to copy and paste between apps, and have no trouble learning new apps with new user interfaces, you will be fine.\n\nUPDATE AFTER ONE WEEK: To get the most out of Dragon, you need to focus on what you are trying to say, and DO NOT INTERACTIVELY EDIT MISTAKES. Dragon's big advantage is in speech recognition, so you want to spend your time dictating, not correcting. It's pretty exciting to dictate a whole page of text, then just go back and batch fix errors or make changes. Again, the errors don't bother me, because I have to edit what I wrote anyway. Also, make sure to use the included microphone or a headset of some kind.

Well if you drill down and jump around enough you can find the same menus if you like spending a few hours figuring out where they moved everything to. Thanks to Googe you can find SOME solutions.\n\nIt only can find one monitor, and you can not tell it you have two, windows 7 allowed you to tell it you had two. I am sure with a little time I will fix this crap. Ok, forget an HDMI to VGA, and running a second monitor with a VGA switch. in Windows 7 it works easy, it DOES NOT WORK IN 10 BUY ALL NEW EQUIPMENT, OR JUST STAY WITH WINDOWS 7.\n\nOk, its only my first few days getting it started. Need to find a freeware program that sets it all back to win XP, or win 7. The ONLY reason to upgrade is some programs check what version of windows they are running on and Microsoft working with other companies like ADOBE will make sure you MUST upgrade, so since it is free I am putting it on an extra drive to start the painful time wasting process of learning what crap has changed, just to change it and make it look different. Lets face it if it looked like windows 98, XP, or 7 that would be to easy.\n\nHope windows 10 actually makes an improvement SOMEWHERE !!!!!!!\n\nBe ready, like I am and have two hard drive to go back and forth. If I am lucky all my programs will work fine in Windows 7 and I can stall off actually upgrading to Windows 10 TILL NEVER.\n\nPROS: It installed without any major problem, it does not like my WD Worldbook, says it is not working, but it is so will let it tell me it is not working, as long as it IS WORKING.\n\n  can't think of ANY OTHER PROS\n\nCONS: they put Windows 8 and Windows 7 together, great way to screw up both systems. I liked Windows 3.1 which slowly changed into the nightmare of Windows 10. Windows 8 should have been on every logon a choice of Win 7 interface or Win 8. That's how mine is set up now, and I always go to Win 7. Not to insult anyone, but Win 8 is just to time consuming to learn when I know Win 3.1 to 7 and all are easy to do everything I want.\n\nI am sure many hardware items will not have Windows 10 drivers, so time to buy all new hardware, again. Mouse and keyboard still work, and the connections are the same small ones that we went to years ago. Still have adapters from back then, thought they might switch back and forth every ten years.\n\nBluetooth dongle, nope no Windows 10 driver\n\nHave not tested my Canon scanner, lost one scanner with every upgrade, just got rid of 5 scanners, in the landfill.\nno new drivers, no slots from the old days, TWAIN turned out to not be as universal as I was hoping.\n\nWISH MICROSOFT INCLUDED NEW DRIVERS WITH EVERY UPGRADE INSTEAD OF A NEW INTERFACE\ngive users the option of what interface THEY WANT TO USE WHEN INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE\nand let them change it later.", "summary": "Windows 10 is worse than Windows 8, who thought Microsoft could do two Vistas in a row", "unixReviewTime": 1446681600}

The main difference, is that it doesn't allow for 3D modeling.  If you only need 2D modeling capability, it is a very viable alternative to the much more expensive full version of AutoCAD 2012.  I've used both AutoCAD 2012 and AutoCAD 2011, and for the most part, they are a very effective way to add some power to your drafting, especially when you combine it with a lower-cost 3D modeling solution, of which there are many. I don't have to do much 3D design anymore, but when I do, I use&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/CorelCAD/dp/B004XO6V1G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">CorelCAD</a>.\n\nInstall was pretty easy and although I have previous experience with AutoCAD, the layout is simple enough where first-timers can jump right in fairly quickly with minimal experience. I did experience some crashing and locking up however.  I can't even begin to describe how frustrating this is.  I installed it separately on two different workstations and both had the same issues.  It didn't happen enough for me to change my rating on the product, but it is still pretty annoying. There are not too many visual differences between it and AutoCAD 2011.  I hate the Dashboard ribbon, but fortunately you can get around this by selecting \"AutoCAD Classic Workspace.\"  I find that things also run much more smoothly by turning off Autocomplete and Dynamic Input.  There is a lot of room for customization within the program and you can set things up pretty much any way that is most convenient to you.\n\nI started out doing some simple designs of my office's data flow, and drafted some plans of our office structure. Doing a data flow diagram, I tend to use the copy function a lot.  AutoCAD 2012 has a lot more features and copy options now that made this much easier to accomplish, including cleanup tools like the ability to merge duplicate objects and removed nested objects that share the same geometry, which it will recognize as unnecessary. Some of my diagrams can get fairly complicated and squashed together, so this is definitely a plus and made things easier.  I will upload a copy of the diagram I was able to complete in the customer images section.\n\nOverall, I think that AutoCAD may be following in Adobe's footsteps and starting to create \"bloatware\" by trying to add too many features and visual aspects, like unnecessary toolbars to their products, so I hope it doesn't continue with AutoCAD 2013.  But if you're looking for a budget 2D drafting option and still want the option to exchange formats with those using the full CAD software, AutoCAD 2012 is the way to go.\n\nEDIT: Diagram had to be deleted from customer images at request of my employer, sorry!", "summary": "A great 2D-only drafting option.", "unixReviewTime": 1321488000}

So I used a TV with a capture card to capture other sources and upscale them for the new TV.  And I've not been without a computer on the TV since.  Once Windows Media Center came out in the early days of Windows XP, I was in heaven.\n\nSo for me, I need something like this to play my blu ray content.  I have PlayStation 3 and 4, as well as the Xbox One, that can play DVD's, but I don't like the interfaces, even when using my Logitech Harmony remote with the Xbox One.  I've always preferred actual discs be played in my computer.  More options for me to do things.\n\nI also have a ton of movies and TV shows in MKV format.  I never bothered worrying about playing them on my iPads and such.  I didn't need them THAT portable, I have a TV in the only two rooms I'm likely to want to watch something.  But when I got PowerDVD 13, I found that the media server worked very well for my iPads and even iPod touch and iPhone.  It was great that my son could pull up all the cartoons I have saved on my media server anytime he wanted with his iPad.  I was able to play my 3D blu rays as well without any problems, and my standard DVD's looked very good.  It did everything I wanted.\n\nSo I had hopes for the version 14.  But while the basics work fine, such as DVD playback, Blu Ray playback, or even using the free PowerDVD remote on my mobile devices to duplicate a touchpad to control the mouse, the one thing I had come to appreciate, the transcoding for remote devices, totally does not work.\n\nI have the app on my iPad, and the iPad can see my computer in the list, but it won't connect anymore like it did in version 13.  It just errors out and says it can't connect.  Or sometimes it will connect, and all I see is an empty folder.  When I look at the computer that the software is installed on and look at the media it is offering up, I see all my files listed without any issues.  Firewall is turned off, there's nothing blocking any access.  From other computers I can still just map the network drive and play things fine, but from the Power Media Player on my iPad, I get nothing.\n\nSince that was a bonus feature that I ended up enjoying, but not something critical for my base functionality, I'm not losing sleep over it, nor wasting time more than the 20 minutes I already spent trying to resolve it.  I just wrote it off as a feature that clearly doesn't work as well as it used to in the previous version.  I'm guessing part of the issue may be that this full version isn't smart enough to see a previous version and just UPGRADE the existing version, but it installs as a separate program.  That was a pain at the beginning, and I ended up uninstalling all the Version 13 components to help alleviate any conflicts from this poor install routine.  I'm guessing that I may be able to overcome some of my issues if I were to nuke it all off of my computer, and just do a clean install of version 14 now that version 13 doesn't exist anymore, but it's just not worth the hassle.  If they can't write their programs well enough to accommodate existing users who upgrade from one version to the next if they end up with a full version of the newer version, then I figure I will spend my time and money and effort with someone else's solution who does want to make the experience as trouble free as possible.\n\nIf you're looking for a way to watch DVD's and blu ray discs on your computer, this will work.  But I'd go with the lowest cost version for what your needs are.  If I had paid for this version, I would've wanted my money back.  As it was free, I'll just leave it alone and just use it to watch discs as needed, if I don't just ditch it altogether and start using the Xbox One for my Blu Ray playback instead...", "summary": "Works well in my environment", "unixReviewTime": 1403308800}

However, it does not take long to understand the intricacies which separate it from basic illustration software. The first thing I noticed when I jumped into it were the alerts that the layer I was working on did not work with the brush I was using, so I made \"Layers\" the first section of the online User's Guide that I would read. It quickly became apparent what the purpose is of the three different types of layers, so I feel I chose well. Once my understanding of layer properties was obtained, the rest of the program became easily understandable, and I have been progressing through the guide in order since, and loving what this program can accomplish.\n\nSpecial brushes produce amazing effects. Existing surface paint colors can be combined and dragged with new colors, or they can be excluded from the effects of a new stroke when on a separate layer. The build-up effect of subsequent brush strokes produces an excitingly traditional look. An extensive list of effects options for the Impasto brushes allows for some astonishingly stunning, real-world effects, as well.\n\nNavigating a canvas takes a bit of getting used to when one is accustomed to dragging the canvas around the screen without specifically choosing a move option, but there is reasoning behind it, while manipulating the red view rectangle within the thumbnail image in the preview pane provides a quickly accessible means to make up for any extra step that would be necessary in the workspace view.\n\nFor users who experienced what they felt was a drastic change in Painter X2, the upgrade to Painter X3 refines some of those changes, making for a simpler, more efficient workflow, while adding several cool new features, as well.\n\nCorel Painter X3 can be used with a mouse, but it is most efficient when used in conjunction with a pressure-sensitive drawing tablet. Not only will it be easier to express the subtleties of light and heavy strokes, but also users will have much more convenient control over the smoothness and the angles of their brushstrokes.\n\nI love Corel Painter X3. It is possible to come across some instructions in the User's Guide that do not reflect the current Painter X3 environment, but these are subtle items, which are easily identified upon their discovery.

This software is significantly cheaper than paying a service to prepare it and much easier than doing in manually.\n\nThe e-file option has been around for some years and is a great time saver for those due a refund.  If you owe money, you might want to save a few dollars and just file manually.  The program will print all the forms you need so it's easy to do and there's no real advantage to electronically filing if you're writing a check.\n\nPlease note that this version covers both Federal and State returns.

However, when actually using it on the road the connection was dropped and picked up once every few minutes, then every time it would pick it up it would recalculate the trip again.  After speaking again to the tech he told me that it might be that the USB ports are not powered enough.  He got this information from another tech and sounded unsure about it.  I myself do not know if this is true.  Perhaps someone who does can comment on it.  I learned also from the tech that there are two different GPS units provided with this software.  I got a Navation GPS 168 with mine.\n The software is great and intuitive.  My 13 year old son quickly figured out how to use it.  Great for finding restaurants, gas stations ect. You do need someone else to run it, it would be dangerous to be making adjustments while driving yourself.\nI am giving it 3 stars,  five stars for the software and one for the GPS receiver to average 3 overall.  The only downside I have found to the software is that sometimes it knows the street name (displays it on the map) but still calls it a \"local road\" when speaking directions.  I think it should work with a netbook, or if it does not they should tell you so in the description.  Tech support was very helpful and even called me back to see if it was still working a few days later.\n\n****UPDATE\n\nWe bought a longer USB cord for the GPS so it could be right up in the windshield and now it works much better.  The cord supplied did not have a very tight connection and the short length made it hard to get it near a window.

This package is for 3 devices and at the time of this review is almost twice as much as getting it for&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Norton-Security-Deluxe-for-5-devices/dp/B015724OVG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Norton Security Deluxe for 5 devices</a>!! Go figure. Lesson: It pays to shop carefully for Norton products because often \"more is less\".\n\nThe biggest changes I see in this product from last year's Norton product is the branding on the box. To be sure there are incremental improvements. Norton Security Deluxe is like the older Norton Security without  Backup for 5 devices. I think this isn't too bad. I like my security software to evolve and improve more than radically change.\n\nNorton Security Deluxe comes with licensing for 3 devices: Windows, Mac, IOS (iPhone/iPad) and Android. This should be enough for many families but maybe not all. You do not get the same features on all devices. I have Windows and IOS so I'll share my experience with these.\n\nBuying a new subscription is less expensive than renewing an existing one. This is a long pattern with Norton products and buying new can save quite a bit.\n\nWindows Setup:\n\n**NOTE** If you have Norton Security (with or without backup) installed and you get this new subscription you will need to remove your device from the Norton control panel. In theory this will uninstall the older product from your computer (but not remove the IOS app for iPhone/iPad devices). In my case I had to manually uninstall Norton Security and reboot my computer before I could install the new subscription.\n\nInstallation is pushed out of the Norton account control panel. AFTER I removed old versions I was able to install Norton Security Deluxe very easily and without problems. I registered the product in my existing Norton account to activate 5 devices I could install. The download went smoothly and installation on my Windows 7 desktop was faster than with older CD based Norton products and similar to Norton Security. I did have to restart my computer.\n\nI found it interesting that the installation branding and the control panel branding is still Norton Security reinforcing my perception of a simple evolution and mostly branding changes.\n\nThe controls in the GUI are simple and clear coming from Norton Security.  There are lots of on/off controls to customize how Norton works. There is a small gear icon for settings on the main screen of the GUI and many controls are hidden in there.\n\nIn operation on Windows I feel Norton Security is continues to be \"noisy\" than pre-2015 versions; I don't feel like I'm constantly being marketed to death. It has the same light impact on PC performance as the previous version.  This is a very good thing! The initial full scan came up clean which is no surprise ince I had last year's version installed before this one.\n\nApplication Compatibility Problems:\n\nUnlike last year's version I have had no application compatibility problems. Last year's version has issues with VirtualBox. Good news!\n\nMobile Support:\n\nThe IOS app is better than before, but not all that much. It has anti-theft features. It does not include any virus protection. The Anti-Theft features include:\n1) locate your phone: this placed my iPhone 6 a quarter mile away!! Also letting it run GPS in the background significantly reduced my battery life.\n2) it can ring your phone: I can just dial the number. If the phone is locked it can't be answered...\n3) it has a \"scream\" function: makes your iPhone put out an annoying siren like noise\n\nIf the \"scream\" actually sounded like a scream this app would at least have some entertainment value. If you have more devices than the 5 allowed in this product, don't waste one on an IOS device! The IOS does not do much for me and the GPS locator drained my battery. I have read that Android devices have better support against malware. I don't have an android device to try this out.\n\nConclusions:\n\nThis incarnation of Symantec's Norton line of retail/home security products is pretty good. It finds things other anti-virus software misses. It does not seem to slow things down noticeably. With this version I had no application problems which is an improvement. Mobile support for iPhone/iPad is poor. The user interface is simple and there are advanced controls available if you need them.\n\nIf you have last years (or older versions) of Norton installed, be sure to remove it from the Norton control panel and device before installing the new version. I could not find a way to move a device from an old subscription to a new one unless I renewed through the Norton site at a higher price. That's annoying.\n\nBecause it's a great product for home users, having to reinstall if you buy a new subscription (vs renewing) and the IOS app remains quite limited I'm giving Norton Security Deluxe 4 stars. It a good product with a few gotchas.", "summary": "Evolution From Last Year's Norton Security: Rebranded, CATCHES Malware Well, Cheaper Than Renewing, 5 User Ver.

Using NetFlix with a TV means you have to have a direct HDCP-enabled connection from the computer to the TV if you're using HDMI to connect to the TV.  Putting a receiver in the middle of the mix breaks the HDCP stream and \"protected\" streams don't play.  You get a mysterious unhelpful \"DRM error\" instead of something useful.\n\n2. When using this as a HTPC, I had to turn off \"super fetch\" and indexing and defragmenting.  Why does Windows defrag automatically?  There's really no reason to do this these days and it can result in data loss if disk blocks are moved over deleted files (i.e., you can no longer recover deleted files).\n\n3. Software updates are just as annoying as they were with XP.  Come back to your computer to use it and find that it's been rebooted.  As a HTPC, this isn't a big deal--as a workstation it's a huge issue to me.  I just leave the updates on because of how I'm using the computer, but as a workstation I'd turn it off.\n\n4.

After installation, you'll be greeted with a registration page upon startup of the program.  After startup, make sure to set your preferences.\n\nSo I couldn't figure out how to add my own track and opted to use one included in the program.  I decided to export a 1080p video to 1080p with the altered audio track to see how it would turn out .  Surprisingly the file is smaller than the original and still seems to retain the quality with what I could only imagine is a lot more audio information.\n\nFeatures I'll hopefully test out will be the live screen capture and later the stop motion animation.

It has the option of being moved below the ribbon, which takes up even more screen real estate, but is still very limited, and cannot be docked or moved from there.\nGranted, there are third party programs, such as Ribbon Customizer and Toolbar Toggle, that add back some of the ability to customize, but it is still far inferior to what Office users are used to!\nEven the third party programs, however, cannot get around the fact that there are some features in earlier Office versions that are simply NOT included in the new one. In previous versions of Powerpoint, you could add a set of icons that, with one mouse click, allowed you to adjust the vertical spacing of text. That has been omitted in 2007. In the \"improved\" 2007 version, you must open a dialog box, and make several mouse clicks to adjust vertical spacing!\nTo make matters worse, Office 2007 documents are not compatible with earlier versions. After spending years establishing formats such as .doc and .ppt as industry standards, Microsoft has introduced a version of office that does not use these formats! If you want to send a document to someone who still has Office 2003 (or any other program that reads .doc files) you need to remember to save it in that format. The default 2007 format cannot be opened by earlier versions!\nOffice 2007 CAN open the older formats, but even in opening earlier Office formats, there are problems. For example, most users of Powerpoint have learned the trick of adding drop shadows behind the text to make the text stand out on the screen. Office 2007 has changed the way these shadows are formed. When you open a powerpoint presentation made on an earlier version, your old drop shadows WILL NOT ANIMATE with the text. When a slide appears, the shadows of the letters are already in place, and the letters animate in on top! Mircosoft's only suggestion... go through your slides and take the old shadows out, and put new shadows in! (I tried this... it takes 30-40 minutes per presentation! ...And I have hundreds of powerpoint presentations in my file!)\nFor someone who never used Office before, or who just uses Word to type simple letters, 2007 may be okay, but for anyone who depends on Office for detailed tasks and productivity, 2007 is a nightmare.\nI have always loved Microsoft Office. It has been an industry standard for ease of use. In my opinion, that is no longer the case. I believe Microsoft tried to produce something \"different\" to attract new users, but in the process totally ignored the needs of those who have used their products in the past. If you have the option of staying with an earlier version, DO NOT UPGRADE to this product!", "summary": "A DOWNGRADE from Office 2003", "unixReviewTime": 1211587200}

And admittedly, Corel isn't quite as versatile as PS, though I think it is actually better for straight art/drawing/painting applications than PS and certainly better than SBP. So if you need an art program and not an art/rendering/photo editing program, this is your guy.\n\nCorel Painter has some features that I absolutely can't live without. The perspective tool is invaluable for making renderings that look proportional (and I imagine super handy for artists) and the brush search tool is so nice. The Watercolor and Flow maps are, as far as I know, unique to CP and make amazing works of art. They help your image really go from digital to real-world.\n\nI use a Mac and CP has a feature that adjust the memory usage of your computer to optimize your program use, which is so clever and works  perfect. Working in CP becomes quick. And CP is much more user friendly and intuitive than PS, perhaps in part due to the limited capabilities (compared to PS), but also because it is well designed. And if you just can't live without your PS, CP is actually compatible with PS and even share some plug-ins.\n\nCP has a seemingly endless supply of brush, paper texture and media.

I can pull from my past experience from other graphic and photo programs with items such as layers, cut/paste, effects, etc. and work my art as I like with paints, pencils, pens, crayons, etc.\n\nOne of the great things I appreciate with Corel is that they post tutorial videos to help a newbie get started with their software.

This was the fastest way for me to get started painting  and familiarize with the abundance of brushes available.  The results have been very pleasing and I still manage to translate my own unique style into the work.

Outlook creates reply emails straight in the email without opening a new screen, making for quicker and easier use.  The icon on the taskbar displays a small envelope when you have mail, which is a nice touch.\n\nI think the only major con is the horrible DRM that they have on it.

They switched it once the outcry was loud enough so that you can re-download every 90 days, which is better but still not good.

For example, I installed antivirus software on my parents' computer years ago, but I almost never run it on mine.  Why?  Because I've grown tired of software that slows down my system, but my parents care less about performance, so it's not a big deal for them.\n\nWithout exception, over the past several years, every time I've attempted to put security software on my own computer (antivirus, firewall), the impact on system resources has been frustrating.

Attending to our spirits promotes peace, health, and a sense of well-being. The effect of stress and anxiety on our bodies is well documented. Likewise, studies are showing the powerful effects of prayer, meditation, and joy on our emotional and physical health.\n\nKurt Smith and Corwin Bell of The Wild Divine Project are two visionaries who have developed a groundbreaking tool that engages mind, body and spirit. The Journey To Wild Divine - The Passage is an \"Inner-active\" computer journey that integrates the power of the spiritual quest with an innovative biofeedback interface and high-end multi-media production. It incorporates mythology and elements of the classic hero and heroine's journey with state of the art 3D graphics, video and music.\n\nIn developing The Journey, Bell and Smith have collaborated with various leaders in the field of consciousness and compassionate action on both the spiritual and biofeedback technology aspects of the project. Known as \"allies,\" they include Jean Houston, a pioneer researcher in human capacities, and Nawang Khechog, a former Buddhist monk and one of Tibet's foremost world music composers and musicians.\n\nBio-feedback is the science of recording both Skin Conductance Levels (SCL) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV), and using this information to modify thoughts, emotions, and breathing. SCL is the measurement of sweat gland activity on a person's skin, and HRV is the calculation of the differences in heart rate from one heartbeat to the next. No two of these intervals are exactly the same, and you need a device more sophisticated than just taking your pulse to determine it. Those who exhibit greater HRV tend to live longer and enjoy life more. When playing this amazing adventure, you slip 3 fingers in the comfortable sensors known as \"Magic Rings\". Your SCL and HRV are interpted by the \"Light Stone\" energy translator.\n\nUp until now, biofeedback technology was in the hands of experts--where a professional had to interpret your results. From those results, you would then learn how to regulate breathing, thoughts, emotional states, and so on. However, with The Journey, the game itself lets you know how you're doing.\n\nSet in the magical Sun Realm, players encounter breathtaking scenery, helpful mentors, and various \"Events\". For example, you're invited to join Cosmo and Sophia in the Inner Imagery Theater--which includes inviting your own partner to share the Magic Rings. Cosmo and Sophia show you how to challenge one other with sensory imaginings, and then you and a partner explore images from the five senses.\n\nFor example, my husband and I entered the Inner Imagery Theater together where we challenged each other with images such as \"I want you to imagine stroking the soft fur of a kitten\" or \"I want you to imagine the sound of a gentle rain falling on a tin roof.\" All of the other Events I've experienced thus far, however, have been for just one person. (But I'm nowhere near completing the adventure!)\n\nIn one of my journeys, I entered a lush courtyard with vibrant greenery, colorful flowers, and majestic colums. I was encouraged to relax and levitate a purple ball. Sound easy? Not necessarily! It depends on how able you are to enter into relaxing breath and peacefulness. There are times when I can float the ball off the screen, but yesterday, I couldn't get it past an inch or so. I was irritated by my son's interruptions (which sent the ball back to the ground!), but it occurred to me that this was a perfect scenario to increase awareness of my thoughts, breathing, and emotional response. After I played the game for about an hour, I was amazed at the marked difference in my mental and emotional states.\n\nHowever, not all \"Events\" are designed to promote calm. With some, you have to think joyful, enthusiastic thoughts and increase the rate of your breathing--such as spinning a pinwheel.\n\nHelpful mentors you'll encounter include The Royal Falconer, Kwan-Yin--Lady of Compassion, Mila-Rugom, and Luna the White Wolf. You'll receive a magic bag created by the Lady Of The Woods, where you'll be able to store items that you collect on your journey--and use for other Events. For example, you'll need to pick a red rose from the courtyard to give as an offering to the Durga. You can save several areas to the bookmark section, in case you want to go back. Sophia guides you when you first start a game, but when you load it another time, you can bypass this introduction and just head right into the gameplay.\n\nThe Journey to the Wild Divine - The Passage comes in an attractive, sturdy box which includes:\n\n*CD-Rom Software featuring spectacular high-definition 3-D graphics and video\n\n*More than 40 unique energy and breathing \"Events\"\n\n*Install disks for both PC and Macintosh\n\n*Easy-to-use \"Magic Ring\" biofeedback sensors\n\n*\"Light Stone\" energy translator\n\n*Supports upcoming multi-user, online experiences\n\n*Original Soul Flight music CD\n\n*Companion Guide and User's Manual\n\nThe music that accompanies the game is filled with gorgeous orchestration from the Soul Flight CD, performed by The Wild Divine Band. Featuring Kurt Smith and Andy McEwen, the band's music (which is sold separately, as well) is intended to have Transformational Effects that can help facilitate the journey of the soul.\n\nThe Journey to Wild Divine is a groundbreaking tool for stress-relief, mindfulness, and meditation--promoting a sense of well-being and health.

I never considered her a culprit.\n\nHenrik van der Hune: A epigrapher that took a tumble on the indoor temple steps. I had to help restore his memory and always felt he was both a straight-laced boring personality to an outright professional in his career.  I never thought he could be the culprit.\n\nTaylor Sinclair: An art dealer in close connection with Johanna. This is the epitome of the sleazy criminal look with the thin mustache, shallow chin, and greasy hair. I didn't know if HER was putting up a facade with an obvious guilty caricature so I was 50/50 in my decision.\n\nAlejandro del Rio:  The U.S. ambassador to the mexican  consulate; he seems firm on righting wrongs that have taken precious artifacts out of the hands of his home country. He was my top option as the culprit because he seemed too handsome and proper somehow for the anger that could be felt beneath his demeanor.\n\nBESS/GEORGE/HARDY BOYS PHONE CONTACTS:  The girls were entertaining as always, but there was only so much they could actually help me with; same for the boys but on an even lesser level.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 82\n\nSCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:\n\nThe music was pretty uptempo and brought one into the mysteries of the Mayan culture.  Graphics were pristine for that early game design period.  Out in the museum garden, those bird noises were pretty unique. Was that a crested Guan?\n\nCUMUL SCORE: + 2 = 84\n\nPUZZLES/MINI-GAMES: The three levels of the Mayan temple reserved for fill-in answer quizzes, basket hoop throwing, and the BUL game, kept my interest for the time being, but they were't challenges that you would describe as overly fascinating. The audio translation match was intriguing because it also helped you learn about the Mayans throughout the entirety of the museum which gave this particular adventure more of a \"learning series\" edge.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: + 1 = 85\n\nGENERAL IOTAS: I wouldn't call that corpse in the monolith a mummy [aren't those properly prepared?].  Why was a missing part of the escape challenge in the Whisperer's mouth? Doesn't make sense.  Also, why was the culprit using that scarlet hand imprint? I never got any explanation of why that was significant.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 84\n\nADVENTURE ENDING: I read too much into how tricky HER might be in this adventure, but it turned out \"not that much\". Why were all three of the innocent characters awaiting me as I exited the monolith? That was a weird situation in which I would want some answers on how this came to be.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: Even = 84\n\n* PART 2 *\n\nI try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to\ntake weeks! Well, it took me four days [12 hours] and I gave myself a\nDetective Score Of : 62\n\nMy Strong Points: My memory was pretty impressive by memorizing the facts of Mayan culture meant for the quizzes and my adeptness at puzzling the pottery and key parts together was there.\n\nMy Weak Points: To save on time, I used a walkthrough only to bridge me from one part of the plot to another without delay. Um, I used this a LOT.\n\nOVERALL GAME SCORE: 84 + 62/ 2 = 73 [ C - ]\n\nBOTTOMLINE: I was pretty bored I must admit, but not because the game was poorly designed. I think that anything that has a setting being museum-focused is bound to make me stare out the window wanting for better days.

I normally went with Mcafee or Norton. When I recieved the product I was pretty interested in trying it. I was fairly impressed with the virus protection yet the firewall, on the otherhand, caused a few problems for me when I would play internet based games through Steam. Normally I would use Sygate's Internet Firewall instead of the bundled firewall as I feel their software is much easier to control and offers features needed for a more advanced user. The problem I'd been having is that even will the Firewall disabled my connection in games online was constantly dropping. For no reason what so ever it just started out of the blue. At first things were fine but for no reason after about two weeks of use the software started giving me trouble. Even with the software completely turned off, whatever processes were running in memory still caused problems. The only way I could alleviate the issue was by removing the software. Upon the uninstall the problems ceased. Now I'm not going to say 100% that Trend Micro is what caused the connection troubles but it sure seems like it was more than coincidence that my problems stopped upon uninstall. Whether it was a scheduled recent update they had done that caused the issue or just a temporary bug in the software it was rather annoying. Still I am pleased as stated before with the virus portion of the software. It detects and finds mostly everything every other antivirus software out there will find and doesn't use much processing power to do so. It also is not difficult to navigate in the least. I would recommend getting just the anti-virus portion and leave the firewall stuff up to another company that has more experience in that area. My suggestion is buy the product from the people that specialize in it. Get your antivirus software from the people who specialize in antivirus software, get your firewall from the people who specialize in firewalls, and get your spyware software from the people who specialize in spyware.

Deciding that $79.99 for a 1 year renewal was more than I was willing to spend on what had been an intrusive and unintuitive security suite I decided to look elsewhere.\n\nI ended up getting Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2009 and have been using it on my system for about 2 months and overall I'm satisfied with the product.\n\nAfter completely removing Trend Micro's program from my PC and installing the Kaspersky program I was prompted for the typical updates. All told the process of installing and updating the software is as easy as it gets for a somewhat computer literate person. Though the initial update can take more than a few minutes to complete download and install.\n\nOnce the program is up and running the interface is extremely straightforward. There's a giant stoplight icon at the top of the application that indicates the current status of you PC. Green = protected; Amber = A scan is overdue or an update needs to be installed or otherwise the application needs your attention; Red = some sort intrusion/malicious application has been detected. Simple and effective.\n\nOne thing that I immediately noticed after running a complete system scan was Kaspersky detected a number of malware/spyware apps on my PC that Trend Micro missed. Actually I made it a point to run a full scan with Trend Micro before I removed it so I was doubly glad I didn't renew that software license.\n\nAfter the scan I ran into my first issue with the Kaspersky software. After the program detects malware - including 1 app that it classified as \"possible key logger\" with a medium threat rating - it's confusing on what it is exactly the user needs to do to eradicate the problem. Is the malware automatically quarantined or deleted? Another issue is that while the Kaspersky program is running it's scan it constantly detects \"possible vulnerabilities\". A lot of those vulnerabilities are associated with with very common programs - MS Office for example popped up at least half a dozen vulnerability logs. I'm not exactly sure what I'm supposed to do with that information and it's not clearly explained.\n\nI have a moderately powered PC and a major concern is always the system resources that anti-virus software suites use. Kaspersky thus far hasn't impacted my PCs performance in any major way. One thing I did notice is that websites are a tiny bit slower popping up. No major foul there.\n\nOverall, I'm satisfied with Kaspersky anti-virus. I've used everything from resource heavy hitters like Norton & McAfee to Trend Micro and AVG - Kaspersky is right around the top of my list for keeping the resource footprint shallow and for it's easy to use interface.

I had to prepare two fairly complex returns that included stock sales, pension annuity, IRA withdrawals, additional employment income, and all the usual deductions (taxes, mortgage interest, medical, etc.). The federal and state versions worked perfectly. The interface is different than Turbo Tax, but works more efficiently than TT. The key to using this program is running through the interview process and then going to the individual forms to double check everything. I found no errors that were not made by me when entering the data. The program picked up Quicken entries flawlessly. This is important to me, since I make heavy use of Quicken for all of my finances including all of my buying and selling of stocks. It was especially important this year, since like most people who invest, I had some carry over losses from 2008. The program also imported information from last year's taxes without problem. It also imported tax information from 2008 TT for one of the returns with no problem. This saves typing.  In my case, the W-2 imports were not available (the same would have been true in TT) because of my particular employment. Hand entering the W-2 information was trivial. Bottom line. H&R Block's State plus Federal tax program is easy to use, accurate, and a much better value than the high priced TT. I also like the fact that you could do an unlimited number of tax returns and a generous number of e-filings. Reaching support for H&R Block is not easy (they are busy), but is a pleasant dream compared to contacting Intuit's TT or Quicken support.

I suggested at the time that the slowness might be ameliorated by having a supported NVidia or AMD video card that could enable the hardware acceleration.\n\nSo now I have version 10 and I do have an NVidia Fermi GTS450 card which significantly accelerates Adobe Photoshop and DxO Optics Pro.  But it seems to do nothing for PowerDirector, even when it lights up the checkboxes for hardware acceleration.  It took an hour and a half (!) to render a 20-minute video, while Pinnacle Studio was done in about 20 minutes. (Pinnacle Studio does not claim hardware acceleration.)\n\nSadly, the file size issue is also still with us - at what appears to be comparable quality settings, the MP4 and MOV files produced by PowerDirector 10 were 2-3 times the size of those from Pinnacle Studio.  Worse, this version fails to produce a watchable MOV at all - it consistently fails with an error at the end of the process, where version 9 did not.  I've been working this issue with CyberLink support for a month now with no success.  (I am in the tech support business myself so I will cut them a lot of slack on this - I did upload my source video and provided all the info requested. Sometimes these problems don't lend themselves to a quick resolution.)\n\nI had more time this round to play with the editing features, and while the UI is still nice, I was frustrated when I wanted to do something like a simple title slide.  There were dozens of animated templates, but many of them were just slight variations on the same theme (how many \"clover\" templates do we need?)  I was able to create my own simple template, but I think that they went just a bit crazy with the bling.\n\nI did not try the 3D features - while the package includes a set of red-green glasses, the software claims to be able to create 3D movies that will play on 3D TVs that use polarizing or shutter glasses. Not having a 3D TV I could not test this.\n\nI really wanted to like CyberLink PowerDirector, but my inability to get it to produce a short video in a reasonable time and size, means that I'll pass it over in favor of Pinnacle Studio, which has never given me a problem.", "summary": "Slow, produces large files, new bugs", "unixReviewTime": 1327190400}

They have went to great lengths to make sure you don't need an Accounting degree to understand it.  A lot of the features not only integrate extremely well with Office 2007, but will remind you a lot of using Office (minus the ribbon interface).\n\nOne of the really nice features of Accounting is the ability to add third-party add-ins.  Out of the box you get an integration module for Paypal, so your invoices can automatically generate Paypal requests and Accounting can automatically classify and deduct the fees for it from the appropriate accounts.  As your business grows, and you decide that you need to do direct credit card processing, Accounting 2008 lets you integrate with CC processors directly -- again, handling managing the costs and fees for you.\n\nDashboards are another strong feature of this product.  How is my business doing?  What is my accounts payable looking like?  How much cash do I have on hand?  All that information and more is available through quick, convenient dashboards.  You can drill down into the dashboards to pull up reports to see more detailed data.\n\nIf you use Business Contact Manager for Outlook then you are in for a treat -- it integrates directly with Accounting to help you track not only customer information, but also communications and marketing camapaigns!  No more having to hunt and search for emails sent months ago or wondering if your marketing campaigns via e-mail are working.\n\nAll in all, I couldn't be happier with the product.  I think it has been a welcome upgrade from Peachtree and thanks to its integration with other products really brings my business into a 360-view.  I know immediately how well things are doing, what my customers are up to, and what needs my attention.\n\nIf you own a small business then do yourself a favor and give this a try.

I am mainly using X4 (now X5) to edit scans of old yearbooks, which often involves stitching together two letter-size pages (8-bit RGB 400 dpi) to 11x17 when an image crosses two pages.  I basically use Photoshop Elements for that, then open the PSD file with PaintShop Pro for the rest of the editing.\n\n7/4/2013 UPDATE: I found a free application on SourceForge named Hugin Panorama used for photostitching, although I haven't tried it.\n\n10/21/12 UPDATE: I previously said I could not manually photo stitch two 8.5x11x400dpi RGB images due to repeated crashing. I just found out the problem is I was running a multiple-clipboard utility called Spartan. Whenever I would copy something to the clipboard it was storing a copy. Apparently the utility was getting \"clogged\" due to the size of the files.  I just tried photo stitch without Spartan running and X5 doesn't crash.\n\nA problem that first appeared for me in X4 and is also in X5 is I cannot scan more than one image without doing a save.  (8-bit RGB 400 dpi). When I do the second scan it crashes. [THIS IS PROBABLY ALSO DUE TO SPARTAN.] To scan multiple pages one after the other I have to use IrfanView. (IrfanView has a lot of nice auto-number features, so I'll probably keep using it.)\n\nBy the way, although I haven't tried it with X5, when I had both X3 and X4 installed I found that once I saved a file as type .pspimage from X4, X3 didn't recognize it as a valid .pspimage file anymore and wouldn't open it.  (Created in X3, opened and saved in X4, no longer X3 compatible.) I assume the same incompatibility exists between X3 and X5.  So if you need to save layers, etc., and switch between X5 and pre-X4 versions, save as a different file type such as Photoshop .psd.\n\nFace recognition is new in X5. On a large set of images of the same person (several photo sets) it did a fairly good job of grouping them, but mainly where the angle, etc., of the face was pretty similar.\n\nLike X4, there are three main sections, Manage, Adjust and Edit, and you can quickly switch between them with tabs in the middle of the Windows title bar. Adjust has a whole new set of Instant Effects with thumbnails showing the effect.  They range from corrective to artistic.\n\nSomething I and others have reported with X3 and X4 that I haven't seen in X5 is that when run it from the Start menu sometimes a message would appear that the program was damaged or illegally modified and needed to be reinstalled.  I have found that sometimes rebooting got rid of the problem.  Alternatively, the Start Menu entry is actually a shortcut. Double-clicking directly on the C:\\Program Files\\Corel\\Corel PaintShop Pro X[whatever]\\Corel PaintShop Pro.exe file would usually work. The program is NOT damaged or modified, the problem occurs with several versions of X3 and X4, and reinstalling does NOT fix the problem. But so far I haven't seen it in X5.\n\nThe difference between X4/X5 and Ultimate is Ultimate comes with several additional items in a Bonus Pack program. Two add-ons are Nik Color Efex Pro 3.0 over 250 effects and styles, along with 30+ emulated film types in 52 filters and over 200 additional Picture Tubes.  Picture Tubes are small images that can be \"stamped\" repeatedly onto a photo for artistic effect.  For instance, you might want to add a butterfly picture tube onto a meadow scene or a bubble picture tube or a star picture tube.\n\nNew in X5 Ultimate is the FaceFilter Studio 2 program from Reallusion. This is a completely separate program specifically for MINOR TOUCHUP of faces. The interface is pretty NON-intuitive--ALL icons, NO drop-downs or text-labelled buttons and no Help. It basically lets you change skin color, eye color, AND EXPRESSION. No change hair color, etc. In the Select Expression screen (Ctrl+4), if you click the button at the lower right next to Keep Result it shows thumbnails of the person with each expression applied. Click on a thumbnail and the After image will change. The altered expression can be exaggerated, so the Expression Strengh slider can be used to reduce the effect. The \"Expression\" can include things like changing the nose width (e.g., Elegant), not just lip and eye position. If you do a lot of portrait touch-up you'll probably want something like Portrait Professional instead.\n\nThe following is not specifically about X5 but may be useful: I used X5 to convert a PNG color scan of a yearbook black-and-white image to black and white using various techniques and these were the resulting file sizes. Chan means use Adjust => Color => Channel Mixer with output as monochrome. Sat-100 means set Saturation (Shift-H) to -100. 32k Chan means first decrease number of colors to 32k, then use Channel Mixer set as monochrome.\n\nSOURCE FILE: 400dpi 24-bit RGB, PNG format.

Symantec (Norton), Avanquest, System Mechanic, etc all make system utility programs that are supposed to help you remove old programs, de-clutter your hard drive, remove viruses and trojans, recover lost files, securely delete old files, etc.\n\nI found Fix-It Utilities to be similar to what I have seen in the other packages.\n\nHere's the trick though - DO NOT INSTALL any of these programs in the name of preventative maintenance. Sure - you need antivirus software, but there are simpler programs out there that offer antivirus protection without all of the other functionality (bloat) that comes in these complete utility packages.\n\nThis type of program is intended for computers that already have problems. For example, I installed this on an employee's computer that was experiencing repeated system crashes, was taking 10 minutes to boot up, took 10-15 minutes to shut down and ran just about every program at half the expected speed. In the case of this computer, Fix-It Utilities successfully removed a bunch of old programs, cleaned up the registry to remove mention of retired servers, and made a bunch of other changes. After that was done, I had it securely delete the unused portions of the drive. The end result is that this machine boots MUCH faster (under 3 minutes), hasn't had a crash since the clean up, and shuts down in less than 5 minutes.\n\nAfter the maintenance was done, I uninstalled the Fit it Utilities software from the machine as it was no longer needed. I re-installed Symantec antivirus and was done. Uninstalling the software took some time, but no longer than uninstalling other utility packages.\n\nBy the way - I normally would have wiped the hard drive and re-installed the OS and apps from scratch with a machine that runs this poorly. In this case there was a particular program used to control a machine tool. The install disc was lost and the machine vendor is out of business so I could not go the reformat route.\n\nTo summarize - do not install this if your computer is working fine. If you have problems with crashes and slow speeds, this program may help you.

They all have their pluses and their minuses.  Yes, Photoshop does everything but it is also an enormous systems hog and has a huge learning curve.  It also does nothing simply and many times I LIKE taking the easiest course to get from point A to point B.\n\nI devised a test for how well this new program does against the others.  I took the image of a lily which I had photographed.  I previously had tried to turn it to a pleasing mauve in Elements and failed miserably. I put it into this program and within about twenty minutes I had a gorgeous mauve lily ready to save.  I was frankly surprised I had done that well.\n\nAlthough it has less tools on the toolbar, I discovered by using other features under the menu that I was able to do pretty much anything I wanted to do. Also, it seems that it may have made one tool to do it all rather than making three or four, like Photoshop or Elements does.  For example, the clone tool on this program seemed to do everything for me that I use clone tool and all aspects of the healing tool for in Photoshop and Elements.  However, I do miss a polygon lasso as this program only has the regular lasso. Both Photoshop and Elements have the polygon lasso. Next, I miss the burn, dodge, and smudge tools, again found in both Adobe programs. On the plus side though, there are filters with controls in this program which go beyond the ones in Photoshop and I am eager to work my way through them. For example, there is a new filter called Bloom that does a wonderful job on enhancing images.\n\nThe user interface is absolutely gorgeous, the best ever.  I like the way it looks on my macbook screen better than any other image editing program. Everything automatically disappears while I am working on the image too.  It all reappears the moment I am ready to proceed.  I love that feature! It is so intuitive. Plus the shortcuts you use in the Adobe programs are the same in this program.\n\nI think this program has enormous potential and I especially like that it was designed solely with my OS in mind.  I am so tired of products designed primarily for Windows.\n\nThis is the first image editing product I've seen that potentially could go the distance against Adobe at least for the non graphic designer market.

It does seem to be a bit faster -- except that the \"VideoBoost\" function that it uses to convert MP4 files doesn't work on either 11 or 12 but did work for me in 10. One new feature is that it will capture video of screencasts. It's not, though, a full featured screencasting program. As far as I can tell, it doesn't work much better than what you get free with the Quicktime Player (on a Mac at least). It also crashes every once in a while: I was going to do a screencast for this review, and wanted to show how it works to convert video files, and while I was screencasting I tried to convert a video file and it crashed on me. I've had no problems, though, with the kind of functions that I use on Toast all the time: mostly converting and archiving video and burning dvds.\n\nI've been using Toast since I switched to Macs from PCs about ten years ago - I think I might have started out with Toast 5 or 6. I've found it does a lot of things I tend to do a lot, and does them fairly quickly: convert video, burn video to dvds, burn cds, etc. Some of those functions are, lately, less essential. Now I burn CDs using iTunes, and tend to burn dvds directly from the program I use to create them such as iDVD or, more often, Adobe Encore. But, when I want to burn a dvd without a menu, or just to burn a random file to a CD or DVD-rom, Toast is still faster than both of those programs. Anyhow, with Toast 10 & 11 it became possible to convert AVCHD files to any playable or editable format I like, even when I don't have the camcorder plugged in as required by iMovie or Final Cut Pro. That can be extremely useful, and Toast 10 also allowed you to burn an AVCHD archive to disk. Toast 12 can do all that, and does it a bit faster.\n\nSeveral functions on Toast can be done elsewhere on programs you're already likely to have. Still, for many such functions it's easier and quicker to fine-tune things with Toast. When I make videos in Premiere Pro or iMovie, for example, I can convert the files to the format I choose on export. But it's not easy to tell from those programs how big the finished file will be. Sometimes after I get the file I find it's too big to upload or send to whoever I planned it for. The easiest thing to do, then, is just drop it on Toast and convert it again, adjusting settings until it predicts a size I need. For professional work, that wouldn't fly because you'd want to just convert it once and get less compression artifacts that way. For sharing with friends or uploading to youtube or Amazon, the quicker the better and Toast is the quickest I've found.\n\nIs it worth the upgrade from Toast 10 or 11? I'm not convinced, but it does have a few new useful features, and it does convert video faster if you have a video card compatible with their VideoBoost feature (oddly, the card on my 2013 Macbook Pro isn't). If you don't already have Toast 10, and you work with video and other files a lot, then it might be worth it -- although there are some decent free converters out there. Toast Pro 11 came with Premiere Elements, which really made it a great deal, but Toast 12 doesn't.\n\nOne thing to note: from my experience, Roxio's customer service is pathetic. Whenever I've interacted with them about a problem in the past, I get a generic response that seems like it could have been generated by a computer that searched a database based on a few keywords in my query. On the other hand, every problem I've ever asked them about has eventually been fixed by subsequent updates. They do seem to be making an effort to improve the actual product, but haven't put a lot of resources into customer support.", "summary": "Not much of an upgrade, but Toast 12 is fairly useful, especially for working with video", "unixReviewTime": 1413072000}

This is a revamped Leopard and not a totally new operating system, but succeeds at improving on already great features. There are software compatibility problems, so it may pay to wait a month or so before upgrading to avoid the annoyance of non-working software.\n\nThe installation couldn't have been more smooth--you basically put in the DVD, hit install, and the OS installs itself.  Unlike every other version of Microsoft Windows, the machine doesn't have to reboot multiple times and Snow Leopard doesn't require any user input until after it reboots into itself.\n\nThe OS offers a nice tweak on OS X's usual features.  There are also a lot of 'under the hood' improvements that take full advantage of 64 bit processing and others that make life easier for software developers.  Apple's description above tells you about most of the improvements, so I won't reiterate that here.  The ones that really shine for me in everyday use are the improved 'stacks' features in the dock, incredible improvements in Expose, expanded 'Quick look' capabilities,faster start up, faster backups with time machine, and Microsoft exchange capabilities in Mail.  Overall, the computer seems to work faster.  In particular, video processing in iMovie and iDVD seem to have gained some more speed.  I have a lot of pictures on iPhoto and before Snow Leopard there was a lot of lag when starting iPhoto up.  Now starting iPhoto is much snappier.\n\nAs many reviewers have pointed out, there's no 'killer' application here and this is less of a new operating system and more of an upgrade on the existing system.  But the price is right and the features really do make the most pleasant to use OS out there even better.\n\nAlas, all is not wine and roses.  There are now internet lists of compatibility problems with software.  If you want to run older software, you have to install Rosetta (now a separate installation).  My biggest annoyance was Microsoft Office 2008: once I upgraded, none of the components would load.  Uncharacteristically for an Apple, the program just hung in the air and would not respond, necessitating a force quit.  After a couple of days and no Microsoft patches in sight, I canvassed the net.  This was a 'font loading' problem.  What I had to do was verify all the fonts in fontbook and remove the offending ones.  I then had to restore them so that Microsoft Office would print in something other than symbol fonts.\n\nThis was not an insurmountable problem, but was the first time in three years of owning a Mac that I had any problems whatsoever. Obviously, Microsoft Office is a third party program and you can't fault Apple completely for compatibility issues.  Even so, lack of Office if you rely on it can make your life miserable. (Kudos to NeoOffice/OpenOffice, their program worked without a hitch.  So did iWork, for the record, but this is an Apple product.) My guess would be that this kind of problem will occur less and less as developers realize that such problems are occurring.  Most problems can be preemptively solved by upgrading all your software before installing Leopard.\n\nThe folks at Mac most likely released this OS as a preemptive strike against the onslaught of Microsoft's latest system, Windows 7.  Having played with the Windows 7 release candidate, I don't think that Apple has much to fear.  Windows 7 is a vast improvement over Vista, in my opinion, but it won't win over the OS X faithful.  And given the economy, the vast majority of users and companies will stick to the more ubiquitous Windows systems rather than buying new hardware.  (My guess is that Windows 7 will be competing more with other versions of itself rather than OS X or Linux for market share.)  Even so, Apple probably wanted to keep its cutting-edge image alive.\n\nSnow Leopard is well worth the price of admission.

It's always exciting to see what new features are added to old favorites, or to discover a totally new program that gives me new features or help me out.  However, with the new release of VideoStudio Pro X2 from Corel I can't see that many new features that interest me -- after using this for two months I am left with the question, \"Just WHY would I need to upgrade to this version?\"\n\nOf course the answer to that question is because of high definition video.  Good answer, but the truth of the matter is that HD is just not catching on -- yet.  It's technology that is slightly ahead of its time.  even Blu-Ray adoption is mediocre, as most people find that regular definition video is doing them just fine.  So when it comes to homemade video and productions one has to wonder what the big rush is to produce content in HD that will, in all likelyhood, be viewed on regular definition devices or uploaded to the 'net that will be compress it down to a more manageable size and form.\n\nThe program itself has many of the same features as the previous version, with the only real big change being added support for HD.  It's still got a lot of the quirks that the previous version had as well -- not exactly easy to use, and requires a lot of tinkering to get the basics down.  If you have anything short of a Core2 machine then you might want to pass this up as it will take a lot of processing power to convert videos and to use the program effectively.\n\nHonestly, I would say that unless you have a burning desire to go HD you can get most of the features you will need for video editing from Windows Movie Maker -- a freebie from Microsoft.  No, you won't get all the bells and whistles -- but come on, how often do we use all those bells and whistles?  Most of us just want to store our home movies in a digital format.\n\nThe bottom line is this.  If you need HD, this is a good choice -- albeit it with a learning curve.  For the rest of us, stick with the older version and skip the upgrade or just use the free Windows Movie Maker.", "summary": "If You Need HD Video, It's Good -- Otherwise, Stick With What You Have", "unixReviewTime": 1230940800}

There are other options out there, but whether we like it or not, most of us keep coming back to Adobe sooner or later for one reason or another.\n\nWhen Adobe switched to the \"Creative Cloud\" online subscription system (where users have to pay monthly or yearly for a subscription to use Photoshop and Lightroom) I joined many consumers in switching to other applications rather than migrating to Photoshop CC. My concerns were justified when Adobe's Creative Cloud system was hacked within the first 12 months and all the credit card numbers for all subscribers were compromised. That security breach alone guarantees that I will NEVER subscribe to Creative Cloud by providing my credit card information to Adobe.\n\nThat being said, Creative Cloud does offer several unique features you won't find in the boxed version of Photoshop CS6 or competitive products. When I saw that Adobe was offering 12-month prepaid memberships to Creative Cloud (so you don't have to provide your credit card information to Adobe) I decided I'd give Creative Cloud a try.\n\nThe latest incarnations of Photoshop CC and Lightroom are the most versatile versions of these programs to date and they work together very nicely. I know many photographers who do all there editing in Lightroom and never even use Photoshop anymore, but I'm old school and prefer working in Photoshop and almost never use Lightroom.\n\nI won't go through the 100s of features in these applications (there are many sites and videos online if you're curious about how to use these programs) but I will say this is the best way to use Creative Cloud with the least risk to your personal credit information.\n\nI'm still not happy that Adobe has switched to the subscription method instead of just letting people buy the software once and be done, but if you need to use Photoshop and Lightroom then a prepaid 12-month subscription card is the way to go.", "summary": "I hate that Creative Cloud is a subscription, but this is the best way to handle it.", "unixReviewTime": 1418169600}

I have a lot of devices, many of those with ethernet ports. For instance, I have a PRISMIQ Media Player that hooks to the TV to watch videos and photos stored on the computer.\n\nThat device has BOTH an ethernet port for wired lans, and a PCMCIA slot to insert a wireless networking card, but it must be of a given brand and model (from a list of supported cards).\n\nI wanted to hook the device to my LAN without drilling holes on walls, and I didn't want to have to seek a special pcmcia card. So I went with one Sony PCWA-DE80. I connected to the Prismiq ethernet port and Bingo!, instant wireless connectivity to my Netgear 802.11a Wireless Access Point!.\n\nA bonus with one of these devices you can say GOODBYE to WIFI driver issues. You just need a WIFI access point next to your adsl or cable modem, and this device. Then you can hook ANYTHING with a working ethernet port to your wireless lan!. It could be  a PC or any other device (could be a game console!). You plug the Sony ethernet-to-wifi converter into the device's RJ45 ethernet port and ... instant wireless connectivity. As far as the PC or  device is concerned, it's talking to a wired ethernet, even while it's not, as the sony devices bridges wifi to wired ethernet networks!.\n\nSetup is a breeze. Just point your browser to the devices's IP address and enter your wifi configuration data (supports wep up to 128 bits), the IP address that you want assigned to it, and that's it!. Then when you plug this unit to any device with an ethernet port, that device will immediately connect to your wifi network!. I even used one of these boxes to get instant WiFi connectivity on my old lan server running IBM OS/2, an operating system that doesn't have plenty of WiFi cards supported (if any).\n\nAnother bonus: switch operating systems painlessly, don't worry about the availability of wifi drivers!. I test software for a living, so I often find myself installing several flavors of Linux on my notebook. However, availability of Wifi drivers for Linux is scarce. So, instead of having to thinker with the computer, I just tell linux to use the notebook's ethernet port, and I then plug the SONY ethernet to wifi converter and that's it. Instant connection and no need to drill holes on the walls.\n\nThe downside: It's expensive, like most Sony gear. You can probably find several less expensive \"ethernet to Wi-Fi\" converters on the market, but to my knowledge the Sony ones are the ONLY that support the 5 Ghz 802.11a standard!, all cheaper devices work ONLY in the 2.4 Ghz frequency, using either 802.11b or 802.11g. I choose 802.11a because, while older, the 5 Ghz band is less prone to interference from 2.4 Ghz cordless phones, microwave ovens (did you know your microwave oven operates at 2.4 ghz?), and wireless security cameras, all of which pollute the 2.4 Ghz frequency spectrum.\n\nThe PCWADE80 works BOTH in 2.4 Ghz frequency (802.11b ang \"g\") and also in 802.11a. Unlike the previous model (PCWADE50) this one claims to support 72mbps \"turbo\" mode in 802.11a!

I went to a video learning company to see how this version 7 works, about two weeks ago, so I could give this review a better shot.\n\n1. The reason I wanted it in the first place:  I bought a video of a man painting a portrait in Corel Painter.  He uses a transparent background in SketchBook, to do a very (blacks, greys, and whites) lifelike rendering of a man with curly hair, a long, scraggly beard, and amazing features that make artists drool.  He showed how he imports the sketch into Painter, and with layers, he paints the man, lifelike, while erasing the sketch a bit at a time.\n\n2. I wanted software to do renderings (just sketching with black, grey, and white values), and under-paintings, on a less memory-intensive app.  This is a big deal, because I leave a lot of apps running (Photoshop, Painter, Browser with tabs, my calender, and sometimes videos with stop action to remind myself to watch them on my iMac.\n\n3. I was told it is very easy to draw with; I have shaky hands, and, even with a large tablet and pen, I cannot draw a decent curve or straight line.\n\nIt is very easy, relatively to draw portraits, or other symmetrical, and semi-symmetrical renderings from life.  As others may have done, I will try to not use technical terms, because I intend to describe their functions, and what they result in (what the results look like), because I get so lost when I hear software-specific technical terms.\n\nThis app has traditional-like tools that Photoshop and Painter do not have, like a french curve, for example (which is what artists use to make perfect curves). If you wanted to draw a perfect rounded corner rectangle - to make the rounded edges have perspective.\n\nLet's say you have to make the rectangle, and you want all sides to be the same - there is a tool that will let you draw one part, while the other part draws it's self.  Very cool.\n\nThere is a mechanism in the app that lets you draw, not only horizontal and vertical straight lines in either direction, but it enables you to draw a perfect diagonal line.\n\nLet's say you wanted to put an oval or circle with a straight line through the middle; it can be done with the app, without worrying about shaky hands.\n\nIf you draw, you would likely know how handy this is.  And a time-saver as well.\n\nIt's a pretty intuitive interface - if you realize that some tools are sort of hidden, as on the top-right of the vertical toolbox on the left side of the screen (as it is positioned right after you load it for the first time), there is a small box, you will find the special pens there in all their vibrant colors, that Anime and Mange characters have been created with from where they originated.  (If you want SketchBook just for these type of pens you can download it for free - just search for it.  I don't see any reason, though, to deny yourself all these traditional-like drawing and coloring tools, unless the price point is too steep for you. Flexible pay-as-you-go, and Cloud-based services are available on your desktop for a lower up-front price.\n\nThere are all kinds of pens, markers, erasers, pencils that you can customize, and save special as you wish.  It might take you awhile though, to start customizing, as you will have a whole lot of tools already!  Don't forget there are tool tips when you hover over tools and drawing media. You can find a whole bunch of features listed if you go to preferences.  I forget hearing about this in the educational video, but I think the mark-making tools like brushes, etc. are pressure-sensitive with something like a Wacom Tablet.  There are inexpensive ones, and not just Wacom is compatible.  Drawing with a mouse plain old doesn't work well with these types of apps.\n\nMuch like in other illustration or design apps, colors can be altered in many ways - or should I say, manipulated.  If you go to preferences you will see how opaque or as rich and bright your colors can be.  You will also find other features that you will most likely find in Photoshop or Painter.  Of course, you can change how many undos, there are selection tools, move, edit, rotate, and scale layers, and so many more features.\n\nThere is a toolbar at the top as well as a semicircle of tools - making a total of 5 ways to control the app - if you include your top menu bar, and the preferences.  Click around.  It is impressive for the money.  You can even control where your toolbars go.  Of course, you can push the TAB key on your keyboard and hide everything except the image you are working on.\n\nThere is a way to set your image size and, the default file format is tiff., which is a smaller, but decent quality file.  This can be exported into a .tiff, jpeg, .bmp, Pixir PSD, or of course an Adobe Photoshop PSD, which imports nicely into Painter or PS.\n\nOf course - layers to build your sketches, making each layer a different part of the sketch.  To newbies, read documentation of some kind. Search for it online.\n\nAnd more below:\n\nNew features -\n\nThere are Perspective Guides to easily lay down perfect 1-point, 2-point, 3-point, and fisheye perspective (if you don't know about artistic perspective - search online)\nAlso,the flipbook animation tool for expressing motion in sketches - WOW!\nAnd, there is an enhanced layer editor, including expanded blend modes and layer grouping. Blend modes are  effects that you can make specific to separate layers; and, if you want, you can separate a group of layers from other layers to save you time, scrolling to organize and streamline layers.\nThe dynamic flood fills with solid, linear, and radial gradients - Gradients are two or more colors blending into each other.  Nice fill for backgrounds, making painted-looking drawings look nice - like making a sun look like it is white hot in the center, radiating out to yellow and maybe orange.  Sunsets.  Skies.\nThe distort transform tool to adjust and position perspective - you can reshape your graphics.\nAnd, finally, improved selection control with polyline and magic wand selection - this means if you want to isolate and manipulate one part of your image, there are tools to do it better.\n\nHighly recommended \"lighter\", but powerful software, with a very attractive interface, workable between multiple apps.

I have about 700GB of files on my PC that need backing up, and USB 2.0 was just taking WAY too long, so I purchased a new Seagate FreeAgent 750GB external hard drive with eSATA connection.  (For those of you unfamiliar with eSATA, it has become the new standard for high speed PC backups to external drives ... most benchmarks show 3-5x faster than USB on actual transfer speeds.) Anyhow, Microsoft is VERY misleading when they say OneCare will backup to any \"external drive\", because it will NOT back up to an eSATA drive.  This is because eSATA connects directly to the SATA ports on the computer motherboard, which means OneCare can't tell the difference between your normal internal drive and the eSATA drive.  So, it ignores them all!", "summary": "Backups - Does not support any eSATA drives", "unixReviewTime": 1198972800}

The machine had been running Windows 7 Pro 64-bit.\n\nFirst, the upgrade was relatively straightforward.  After inserting the disc and selecting the relevant menu options, it was off to the races.  Although it is an upgrade package that will upgrade the existing operating system, it was not able to preserve the programs I had installed on Windows 7.  It did save several settings; however, I had to reinstall Office, Photoshop, etc.\n\nIt found drivers on the installation disc for most devices I had attached, with the exception of a TP-Link wireless adapter.  That device requires a hard-wire connection to the ethernet to allow Windows 8 to pull the driver from the Microsoft Windows Update site.\n\nOverall, the installation process was quick -- less than 1/2 an hour -- and relatively painless.\n\nThe Windows 8 Metro interface has taken some flak, especially when run on a desktop system.  Although it takes a little getting used to, it is actually quite flexible.  If you hunt around for information about keyboard shortcuts, you'll find that pressing the WINDOWS key and the X key will pull up a power user menu that will get you right into the control panel, disk management, etc.  These keyboard based shortcuts are great.  Microsoft screwed up here by failing to include any direction about their existence.\n\nThe biggest adjustment is the absence of the start button menu.  However, its functions are all still there.  You just have to learn how to access them.  For example, from the start page in Metro, you can just start typing to run a search for a file or app.  You don't need the search box in the old start menu to do that.\n\nFor those who complain about booting to Metro instead of desktop, I wonder whether they're just looking for things to gripe about.  When you boot into Metro, you just need one mouse click to proceed to the desktop.  Have we become so flaccid and spoiled that a single mouse click is too much labor and too much delay in our lives?  Really?\n\nThe system boots and shuts down in no time flat -- I have a Sandisk SSD in the computer, and it boots into Windows after POST (the power on self test diagnostic) in under ten seconds.\n\nOverall, this package works decently to upgrade your OS to Microsoft's latest offering.  You probably don't need to make the upgrade if Windows 7 is still working well for you.  You'll get faster boot times and some small system improvements, but it isn't an earthshattering performance boost.\n\nWhen Windows 8.1 rolls out later this year and permits users to boot directly to a desktop with some kind of start menu, more users may find occasion to upgrade.", "summary": "A decent upgrade that gets knocked too much", "unixReviewTime": 1373932800}

I went directly to the form (which needed some finding, it's called Student Info Worksheet), entered the value directly, and after that the field popped up on the interview.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with the product, but of course I'll be even happier when I'm finally done using it in April!\n\n[Update Jan 31, 2014]\n\nSo far I've downloaded several updates, and the program has continued to work without any hitches.

Rest assured, our programmers are on it.\n\nThat may work if you sign out, sign in and try that again.\nIf you see this again, please contact us so we can help.\n\nI am not amused. NASA wouldn't have ever gotten to the moon with TurboTax 2011 Software. They'd never gotten to the launchpad. Or the rocket built. We'd still think it was made of swiss cheese.\n\nThen, of course, when you go back and try again, your data is often correct--after all you just entered a four digit number! Why would that break a system?\n\nSo, yes, believe the reviews. I haven't even started the individual tax return and I am worried. I might be buying TaxAct or whatever I can find before this tax season is over because my trust level is kaput. I could do 1099s online at the IRS site or handwrite them, they are the easiest, simplest form I will deal with over the next few months. But I bought TurboTax to make it even easier. And if it can't handle these, well, I shudder and I worry.\n\nAnd if you are in the same boat as me and bought early before the reviews and WANT to try this anyway, well, the functionality is slightly better in Google Chrome over IE 8. Not much but at least I got a file to transfer on my sixth attempt on Chrome. So my names were imported from last year's file. Never mind that it said it didn't and then it transferred the file twice and now won't let me delete the duplicates without that lovely Houston message I shared above. I finally got one to delete after 8 attempts. I may not be so lucky with the rest of them.\n\nSo yes. Crap. Utter, useless crap. I want a refund but it is software so that's not possible since I've ripped open the box and loaded this simulation of a tax preparer.\n\nThis is my 9th year using TurboTax and by far the worst experience I have ever had with it. Phooey on Intuit.\n\nUPDATE on 1/31/12:\n\nAfter countless attempts at data entry in the online 1099/W2 Reporter system, I finally got my 8 1099s completed. It took me 6 hours of repeated attempts to get the data entered. Yes, I was foolish. I could have done it somewhere else in less than an hour. Then I read in another review here that there is a backend way to do the reports through the software.\n\nClick FILE in the upper left hand corner menu and select NEW TAX RETURN and the selection like previous years. For kicks and giggles I decided to do that after finally printing up and mailing the 1099s today, a few days past when I intended. The whole process took me 15 minutes, what it has done in previous years. Why did Turbo Tax not give us the outright option? Why did they release extremely flawed online software? (Even selecting a state doesn't work in the drop down boxes unless you hit a hard enter after selecting, otherwise it clears out the field when you move to the next one. Nevermind the inability to process submitted info, the forms can't even handle data entry such as 5 digit only zip codes, etc.)\n\nSo this is too little too late for me and for you, but perhaps someone will be saved the headache.\n\nAnd do save that return for the 1099/W2s in the software (the work around) because even though you save it, it doesn't not come up as an option for your ongoing working returns in the open file page. You have to browse for it on your computer--know where you saved it!--if you need to access it again.\n\nPure idiocy...", "summary": "Once A Loyal Customer, Now an Irate One--Found a Work Around", "unixReviewTime": 1327708800}

Version 1.0 ran adequately on the first two units and from all appearances this version 2.0 is not as resource intensive as the earlier version however, LiveUpdate remains an annoyance.\n\nSimilarly to version 1.0, it appears the only other Norton product that is compatible with 360 is Norton Ghost.\n\nIn the case of the older unit, performance of Norton 360  was consistently problematic so I was not surprised to encounter difficulties with the upgrade however I had no inkling of the extent of encumbrances I would face in what from a cursory view appeared to be a rather benign installation.\n\nLike security suites offered by other vendors version 2.0 includes virus protection (unfortunately still updated via LiveUpdate whereas NIS 2009 is migrating to real time updating) firewall, spyware and intrusion protection, email scanning, parental controls and anti-spam filtering.

As an all in one product, some compromises in user control could be anticipated however it would have been an advantage if the user was offered the capability to backup individual files rather than continuing the limitation to classes of folders.

Only the mac address of the access point is identified therefore from my primary computer I cannot fully monitor a second PC or my NAS.\n\nThis version also includes registry cleaning as a component of the PC tune-up facility and \"identity safe security\" of personal information like social security, bank account and credit card numbers. The phishing filter is an improvement over version 1.0 however it still lacks the comprehensiveness of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/McAfee-Site-Advisor-Plus-2009-1-User/dp/B001EJQTUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">McAfee Site Advisor Plus 2009 1-User</a>&nbsp;in as much as it does not offer advice search engine results. Significantly, the phishing filter does not work with Safari or Google chrome.\n\nAnd then there was the upgrade on my older PC...\n\nIn spite of Norton's representations, I would not recommend installation on any PC that meets only minimum system requirements. At every step, I encountered difficulties that severely constrained the process and after 24 man hours devoted to installation the process is still incomplete.\n\nFirst and foremost, upgrade is not automatic. Although 360 offers three PC licensing, I could not download the upgrade via my existing account. Only after email inquiry was I provided  an address that facilitated download to my second and third PCs. In the instance of my oldest unit I made the mistake of running the recommended system scan before installation. It occurred to me as well, this does not generate a great deal of confidence in Norton if in fact one is upgrading or replacing an existing Norton anti-virus program. I received a message indicating this version was incompatible with Windows Defender so I had to remove that program before proceeding. I did not pre-scan with the other two PCs and no compatibility issues were identified nor I have experienced any since the upgrade or have I ever encountered issues in the two years I used 360 version 1.0.\n\nAlthough during install procedure on my first computer I was advised existing add-on packs should be backed up using another program that must be downloaded from the Norton site, the same message was not received for either of the later installs and the add-on pack itself appeared on my desktop upon completion of the preliminary stages, but I get ahead of myself. The install aborted three times because LiveUpdate was running in the background and could not be terminated even manually via msconfig or the task manager. When I finally managed to disable it, I later discovered another version initiated by Norton Ghost could not be removed, so I had to uninstall Ghost before proceeding. Degradation of system performance was clearly evident as at least five hard stops were required and in each case the difference in boot times was visually perceptible without Norton running. Eventually, the install was completed but start up would not progress past the call to explorer.exe which was visible but the desktop icons were never painted...another hard stop via task manager and restart.\n\nFinally, the configuration wizard appeared and I was able to setup the program...only to discover Norton had identified un-removable cookies,an un-repairable virus and my virus definitions from version 1.0 had not updated via LiveUpdate for more than 8 months. Following program instructions to contact online support for more information, I reached site catch 22 as the more information could not be gleaned until I defined the problem inhibiting installation...After removing the cookies with spybot and determining the virus was most likely Norton Ghost LiveUpdate, and  running a new version of LiveUpdate for more than two hours to acquire all of the missed updates, I received an email from support advising I should download a software removal tool to wipe out any residue programs, which of course would also wipe out my latest install and render 14 hours of effort pointless.\n\nSo now, I have version 2.0 installed and running with significantly greater degradation than version 1.0 as it applies to response time for Explorer or Firefox so I'm using Safari as the default browser and it performs with blazing speed even on this under resourced box with Norton installed. Of course...my install of Microsoft Office suite has been damaged so I have time to type this on another computer while I wait for the re-install to finish...", "summary": "The Dickensian install", "unixReviewTime": 1223596800}

It installs flawlessly, and even will uninstall other antivirus software in case you forgot to do this yourself, which I thought was a really nice touch.  My main criteria for security software is that it needs to run quietly in the background and not hog resources or cause other system issues - which McAfee Antivirus and Norton Internet Security can't seem to figure out how to do.  Before this I used to use Trend Micro PC-Cillen exclusively because it used very little system resource compared to the others, until their latest version which suddenly ballooned into huge resource hog - I don't know if they've fixed that yet or not, I haven't gone back to it since.\n  Bitdefender seems to have none of the problems that plague other security software, and I would switch to it exclusively, except on my main PC's I am sticking with Windows Live Onecare, which does the best job of integrating seemlessly into the OS (naturally, since it is Microsoft).\n  As far as which is better at stopping viruses and malware, I can't really say, since I am a low risk user and rarely am threatened with viruses and have never accidentally downloaded malware.  I suspect Bitdefender would out perform Windows Live Onecare on this score, which is why I would definitely recommend it to any who doesn't practice safe surfing.\n  All in all, it's a very comprehensive security package at a great price and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to friends and family.", "summary": "Great security suite, great value", "unixReviewTime": 1225756800}

With this Professional code, you don't actually have to pay an annual fee, but it's also only valid for the life of your PC. Your ONE PC. This is definitely not buy it once, have it forever software.  So, in other words, you'll probably have to buy Office code for your other computer or if one crashes. With that in mind, going Home Premium is probably the cheapest bet - and at least you can use the code on up to 5 computers - but you do have to pay up each year if you want to keep your software.\n\nBut now that I've griped about that, let me say that I am fairly impressed with the 2013 upgrade. The SkyDrive Cloud concept is obviously the most notable change, allowing you to save directly to your online storage space rather than to the hard drive. I think this is a great way keep documents updated and accessible anywhere without having to e-mail yourself the documents or trying to remember which version is which. Very cool.\n\nOther than that, you'll find mostly cosmetic upgrades that will take some time getting used to and don't serve a lot of purpose, but do look nice. There are some really cool new templates, especially in Excel, that are worth checking out. When you type in Word there is a kind of delay or typewriter effect as the letters appear which is kinda cool I guess. At first I thought it was weird, but now I like it.\n\nOVERALL: Although Office is going a little too far to milk the customer for every penny they're worth, I love the save-to-cloud upgrade that Office 2013 offers and am a fan of some of the new content/layouts. As everyone knows, Office is a must-have for pretty much everything we do in the world nowadays, and it is fabulous software. If you don't care about the cloud, however, don't feel like you have to rush out and upgrade.

Now, try Streets and Trips with the GPS again, and it should be working, with the PC in normal mode.\n\n********\n\nOnce this was done the GPS did pick up satellites.  However, when actually using it on the road the connection was dropped and picked up once every few minutes, then every time it would pick it up it would recalculate the trip again.  After speaking again to the tech he told me that it might be that the USB ports are not powered enough.  He got this information from another tech and sounded unsure about it.  I myself do not know if this is true.  Perhaps someone who does can comment on it.  I learned also from the tech that there are two different GPS units provided with this software.  I got a Navation GPS 168 with mine.\n The software is great and intuitive.  My 13 year old son quickly figured out how to use it.  Great for finding restaurants, gas stations ect. You do need someone else to run it, it would be dangerous to be making adjustments while driving yourself.\nI am giving it 3 stars,  five stars for the software and one for the GPS receiver to average 3 overall.

I think it should work with a netbook, or if it does not they should tell you so in the description.  Tech support was very helpful and even called me back to see if it was still working a few days later.\n\n****UPDATE\n\nWe bought a longer USB cord for the GPS so it could be right up in the windshield and now it works much better.  The cord supplied did not have a very tight connection and the short length made it hard to get it near a window.

You can then use this marker to attach one of your animations. Imagine the possibilities: Animated characters can dance with your children on video-all you have to do is animate the character, then attach the animated character to your child in the video. Cool!\n\nLip Syncing: You can sync a characters lip movements to audio easily. This is pretty hard to do manually. Anime Studio has a command to take care of it. So the character dancing with your child can sing too!\n\nLots of Import options, including Photoshop. Anime Studio preserves Photoshop layers, which saves lots of time if you use Photoshop.\n\nFinally, keep in mind that animations are not necessarily cartoons. Anytime you need a picture or text to move in a complex way on top of or below other pictures, you are doing animation. So there are business applications too (think product instructional videos with animations of parts interacting with other parts, with hatches opening and latches latching...you get the idea).\n\nOK, now for my input device recommendation: Anime Studio has good drawing tools.

I pointed towards my folder stucture that I use with lightroom. The organizer is easy to use and has a good feel to it.\n\nWhen it came to editing photos this is where I struggled at first. Photoshop Elememts is defintely easier but does not have as many edit capabilites. Corel did include some one step fix features but I believe they did not work well enough for me, I wanted more control. When I ran the one step photo fix I felt the photo became to overexposed and needed tweeking.\n\nWith HDR Imagery being the rage lately, Corel included it in X3. It does not produce the result I like from HDR and does not give enough control like Photomatix. I am going knock Corel for this because I was suprised to see it even included.\n\nPerformacnce wise I did not experienceany real slowness but I am running Intel I Core.

After Corel bought Ulead the quality of the product declined.  Video Studio does require a powerful computer to work well. Yes it may run with the minimum I would hate to see how it performs.

There are more than enough templates to create a stunning DVD menu.\n\nIf you have a newer NVidia video card the software allows to use the GPU for acceleration.

I found the 2008 version for 3 computers for two years at a great price.  When it was running out, I went looking for a similar deal and found one.\n\nI noticed a couple of unpolished elements when installing.  There were a lot of DOS command prompt windows opening in the background on the screen very briefly.  I didn't have to interact with any of them and they went away almost immediately so there's no harm to it.  It's just a little unpolished.\n\nI should also mention that the update for it is big.  It will ask to download the updated installer, then after a few minutes when that's downloaded and run the updates for the program are currently over 75 MB.  I think that's probably the case with many anti-virus programs, but just be aware if you're on dial-up you'll be downloading for quite some time.\n\nI uninstalled that old&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/2008-version/dp/B000V809KW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">2008 version</a>&nbsp;from a laptop and a desktop.  The desktop went fine, but the laptop failed to uninstall.  I tried to get the uninstall program off Bitdefender's website, but the link they pointed to was dead.  Eventually, I found the CD and reinstalled, which failed, but the CD had the uninstaller which worked.  I only mention this because it's a little worrisome that if the last program had those issues that this version might when I eventually uninstall it.\n\nI like this version of the program.  It has several different modes ranging from Novice (hides settings) to expert (showing all of it) and is very easy to change between them.  My absolute favorite part though, is the \"you're not fully protected\" system.  In past programs I've used, if you disable some feature you constantly get the little alert icon that you're \"at risk\".  Bitdefender 2010 lets you choose which of those things it monitors for.  So I didn't want the anti-spam because I only use web mail, so I told it not to bother me that I'd deleted it.  It may be a small thing, but to me it's a huge annoyance saver.\n\nSo far, I cannot tell if the scanner is faster or not.  It scans at only about a quarter of the number of files per second as the old program, but it supposedly has an intelligent monitoring system which lets it avoid rescanning files that haven't changed and thus couldn't have picked up an infection.  So while it wasn't that fast on the first scan, in theory it'll only get faster moving forward.  It intentionally skipped thousands of files.\n\nDefault is a daily scan, which in my opinion is complete overkill.  Unless you have a kid in your house, if the resident protection is running all the time you can get by with once or twice a week.  Thankfully, the scheduling is very easy and you can even set the scans to take low priority, which is a nice touch.\n\nIn terms of detection, BitDefender isn't the highest rated scanner, but it's far from the lowest.  It's an excellent budget anti-virus package and more than adequate for most people's needs.  Considering how reasonable the pricing is, I'd happily recommend.  However, since I've only used it a week or so, if it does do anything really weird I'll update my review to mention it.\n\nUpdate 8/3/10\n---------------\nFinally had to use my printer and guess what?  BitDefender has killed it.  I can't use my network printer so I'm dropping this review a couple stars.  I killed its firewall and turned the Windows one on again.  Guess what?  I can print again.

For more startling stats see the NOD32 Anti-Virus comparative (their web site)...\n\nYou MUST first COMPLETELY uninstall NSW, before installing NOD32...!-\nNorton now provides you with an easy \"ALL products\" uninstall tool called \"symnrt\" (search their web site!)(Don't Add/Remove anything, but the leftover pgms)(After a restart!))).\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nOld review-\nI am a home software tech (28 years).\nI can see why SO MANY reviewers had so many NSW problems...!- NSW is tricky..., and difficult to install PROPERLY, especially if you had old Norton..., or ANY other anti-virus (see \"Fix-It Utility 6...\", below)!! NEVER run two \"active\" anti-virus, or anti-spyware!\nMy install procedures... (below) can be adapted for ALL Norton antivirus..., or any others (corrupted system too...!)!\n\nFeatures+!-\n1. NSW 2006 automatically updates NEW virus definitions DAILY (0-25). ALL older versions only update \"once a week (no matter how often you run Live Update!)\"!\nWhen NSW daily updates definitions, it automatically does a \"Quick Virus Scan\"!\n\n2. My email... scanning is MUCH faster, than with old Norton!\na. My Symantec total System Performance Test went UP from 295 to 1350 (DELL XPS400, 3.2ghz Pentium D cpu, Raptor 10,000rpm single sata hard drive (WOW!), 2000mb memory)!\nb. System antivirus scan is a little slower, but more thorough (found 2 viruses my old Norton missed!)! Protection center takes a minute on startup to scan for security problems- GOOD!).\nYou should also consider GOOD \"full time\" spyware protection!-\n#1 Spyware Doctor (84%, latest independent test...), or\n#2 SpySweeper (66%). The rest are abysmal!\n\n~~~\n1. The biggest reason that sooo many people have dificulties..., is that they don't \"COMPLETELY\" get rid of their old antivirus/\"LiveUpdate...\" first!!!\nA simple add/remove... uninstall, won't do it!- Browse the Symantec support..., for uninstall instructions on your \"EXACT\", product BEFORE you attempt an uninstall (see SymNRT...)!\nI found Symantec free email tech support to be fast (48 hrs max) and EXCELLENT!\n\nNote A- Procedure (takes 1 hours+, to do it right!)! Print procedure out, before trying (VERY detailed/complex!)!\n\nNote B- You may think this long procedure is a hassle..., but much better than a full system reinstall! It's FUN when things... go right, and an \"advanced\" learning experience!!!\n\n IMPORTANT NOTE C!- ALWAYS wait for your HD (Hard Drive) light to stop blinking (for 15 seconds)!- Just because ANY application... says Finished/Restart Now..., it hasn't removed/written/finished ALL the registry/files... yet! SLOW DOWN, & you'll see HD blinking!\n\nBackup your \"critical...\" files (Favorites, cookies, email address book..., email ( I recommend ABC Outlook Express!- saves all & trees too!)  to an \"external\" source.\n\nI  then use Acronis 9 (same as Ghost, but dependable!) for a \"Full Image Backup\", to a Western Digital external HD, and really like it (see my amazon.com Acronis 9 review...)! Easily restore your WHOLE system. Acronis is not compatible with Ghost or GoBack (NSW... also recommends NOT installing GoBack!)!\n\n1. Disconnect from internet & restart.\n\n2. COMPLETELTY uninstall/remove ALL previous Norton/Symantec... pgms &  tracks...!-\n a. Uninstall ALL old Norton... pgms- Norton..., GoBack, Ghost, Live Update, WMI, Live Reg... Restart after each! SLOW DOWN!\n b. Symantec uninstall NSW advisory, tells you how to FIRST disable ALL NSW services (VERY complex!), as XP uninstall will not \"completely\" remove old NSW files/registry... in use (many processes are hidden...!)!\nYou should not have to do this IF you \"lastly\" run #1 Fix-It Utilities 6 (see my Amazon.com review!). I disabled services... & Fix-It still found/deleted over 250 invalid registry/files (Cleanup, Fix Registry... Green only!). My ONLY \"safe\" registry/file cleaner that found/deleted ALL...!\nRestart.\n\n3.  Run chkdsk... (to repair ANY System/file errors...!)-\nMy Computer, RIGHT click on C drive, Properties, Tools, Error Checking, check Auto\nFix... (ALWAYS check!- System errors too!).\nRestart, \"TWICE!\" & SLOW DOWN (all changes don't take effect, until HD light stops blinking!)!\n  a. Defragment your HD ( I recommend Diskeeper 10 Professional Premier!- REALLY speeds up your computer (40%+ WOW!)!!!- see my amazon.com review)).\n  1. WAIT 1 minute (Registry changes, after ANY defrag is slow!)! Restart!  You can also defrag from C Tools (as in error chkdsk... procedure above, but- Defragment Now instead of Error Check...)...\n\n4. Now you are ALMOST ready to install NSW- On to \"Clean Install Mode\"!-\nALL services & programs MUST be stopped (especially anti-spyware! See my amazon.com review on SpySweeper!).\nThis is how to safely/easily do a \"safe/clean install\" (for that matter- ALL pgm installs!), in disabled... mode.\n a. Start, Run, put \" msconfig \" (sans quotes) in box. OK\n  1. Put a dot in Selective Startup. Remove check from Load Startup Items. Apply, Close (wait for HD lights!), Restart...\n  2. OK, Cancel (gray boxes. Wait for hour glass & HD lights!)\n  3. wait 1 minute & Defrag again (slow down! This makes NSW files contiguous/performance!) & restart TWICE...!\n\n4. Now to install NSW (no internet, firewalls, no nothing!)-\n a. Dot in Custom Install!\n  1. Uncheck- !GOBack! (Per NSW- plays havoc..., even if you don't have Acronis!). Utilities box, uncheck- System Doctor, Speed Disk, and any others...,  you don't use...\n  2 . Good ones!- WinDoctor, DiskDoctor, Explorer Extension... (if you don't know..., leave them)...\n\nb. IMPORTANT NOTE!- During the install it check/asks you if you want \"Worm Protection\". This is REALLY a sorta firewall, in disguise (I had to start over here... DRAT!, as it conflicted with my Sygate 5.5 firewall! DRAT)!\nLuckily I had an Acronis system restore backup! (XP restore is flaky... & doesn't do it ALL!)!\n  1. ONLY If you don't already have a 3d party firewall ( I really like Sygate \"5.5!, only!\"!), REMOVE the check.\n  a. If you only have the standard XP firewall, leave it in!\n  3. Install NSW be VERY patient & SLOW DOWN (always!)!\n\nc. Remove CD, Restart . SLOW DOWN!\n  1. Manually start your 3d party firewall (if you have one), & log onto internet (hope you have high-speed!).  You may have to do this around... the NSW messages...\n  2. Wait awhile, & Norton Protection Center will keep coming  up with \"do now...\" alerts!\n  a. Whatever you do, \"always\" exit this now...!\n  b. Whatever you do DON'T run \"One Button Checkup...\"!\n  3. Actvate NSW... (I didn't register?)\n  4. If Live Update doesn't come up automatically (slow)-\nOpen NSW... & do a \"Live Update (biggy!). Be VERY patient (seems like not-responding, but is really working...). Restart when asked. SLOW DOWN!\n  5. Enable 3d party firewall, and Live Update again. Keep doing this until no more updates.\nRestart.\n\n5. Disconnect from internet & go back to Run/msconfig..., and remove the gray check from Load Startup Items, again. Apply, Close (wait for HD lights!), Restart...\n  a. Defrag again (packs NSW files, for performance).\n  1 minute, & Restart.\nb. Now go back to Run/msconfig... & put dot in \"Normal Startup\". Apply, Close (wait for HD lights!), Restart...\n  1. Log onto internet. Restart.\n  C. This is a GOOD time to do another Acronis backup!\n\n6. DANGER!- All NSW Cleanups... will delete your IE favorites & cookies! To save them...-\n  a. Open NSW, Options, Norton Cleanup, Internet Clutter & remove check from cookies..., \"Saved Web Sites\" folder & \"Import Favorites\", Apply, OK.\nRestart (ANY changes... don't take full effect, until AFTER a restart!).\n\n7. Now schedule a weekly system scan- Start, All Programs, Accessories, System Tools, Scheduled Tasks, RIGHT click on Norton Scan..., Properties, Schedule (set time...), Apply, OK.

[Is that right?] No? Anyway, she gets to rub elbows with a Soap Opera Star in the Big Apple. Oh yeah, there is the confusion; isn't this supposed to be in Hollywood? Well, it's all about climbing the ladder of goodwill and what better way than through the entertainment industry, right?\n\nINITIAL SCORE: 85\n\nCHARACTERS:\nMattie Jensen: The girl of the hour. Stick with her and you'll go far, kid. Well, all she did was sit around rehearsing lines, but that is the life of an actress. I did see her one scene she had acted which wasn't bad. No, I don't think she's the culprit. Why is she dating around so frequently like that? Ick.\n\nMille Strathorn: That silly old bat. Loved her riddles [half have been done before in other venues]. I think she is getting a little senile, but I don't think it was enough to be considered the culprit, especially since she owns the place.\n\nLillian Weiss: Man, she needs to get la.... wait, this is a family show. She was just a mean girl, but her abrasiveness was so strong that I doubted she was the culprit.\n\nWilliam Pappas: I only heard grumblings from his office. If he don't physically appear in the game, he ain't the culprit :P\n\nDwayne Powers: This guy was just falling apart! [Financially, second-guessing his relationship with Mattie, etc.]  I am glad he cast me as an extra! Yaahhh!\n\nRick Arlen: He was a smooth talker and a couple of his one-liners made me smile, but I had him firmly in my target sight as the evil villain.\n\nPhone-A-Friends: This has got to be the 2nd best interplay in the relationship of Nancy/Ned aside from the Captive Curse argument. They said they loved each other! That was amazing only Adventure # 2 into the series since I don't believe I have heard it since. By game # 31, is the romance getting stale? This version of Bess had an odd accent and I believe this particular game was the most helpful George has ever been.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: + 2 = 87\n\nSCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:\nThe background music was a little blander than other games, but it didn't detract from the ambience. You have to forgive the cartoonish graphics from 1999.  Overall, it was fine.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: Even = 87\n\nPUZZLES/MINI-GAMES: Like I mentioned before, the riddles were intriguing since it hasn't been done again in the series. There were no mini games. :(  In fact, I think HER went with plot and culprit motivations over cheaper filler material, which makes this game stand apart from the later adventures in the series.

I am not necessarily complaining, but compared with other endings, this was definitely bottom 3 for HER all time.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: - 2 = 82\n\n* PART 2 *\nI try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to\ntake weeks!

By most accounts, Windows 7 is what Vista should have been.  Do we finally have a worthy successor to XP?\n\nPROS:\n- Fast startup and performance\n- Stable\n- Nice aesthetic and functional changes to the desktop\n- Improved networking, power management & security\n- 32-bit & 64-bit versions included\n- Windows Media Center\n- Windows XP Mode (Professional & Ultimate only)\n\nCONS:\n- User Account Control still annoying\n- Upgrade can be challenging\n- Expensive\n\nThere are only two Microsoft operating systems I've personally skipped since DOS 6.x-- Windows ME and Windows Vista.  Windows ME was so terrible that PC World coined it the \"Mistake Edition.\"  Vista, when initially released, was considered to be bloated, relying on higher hardware requirements than XP, while being outperformed by XP on identical hardware.  With Microsoft fast-tracking Windows 7, I decided to skip Vista altogether and upgrade to 7.  This review briefly touches upon some of the key features and enhancements of Microsoft's latest OS.\n\nPERFORMANCE & STABILITY\nOne of the welcome enhancements Microsoft made was start-up time.  The shutdown time has been improved as well.  Also, in my non-benchmarked experience, Windows 7 has been at least as fast as XP if not faster.  The kernel changes and ability to run the 64-bit version probably has a lot to do with that.  Most benchmarks from around the Internet seem to support my observations.\n\n64-BIT\nI am elated to finally upgrade to a 64-bit operating system in order to take advantage of more memory support and modern processors.  I have Intel Core 2 Duo processors in both my systems with 4GB of physical RAM but XP only allowed 3.25GB for system use.\n\nDESKTOP\nAt first login, you'll notice the changes to the taskbar.  The taskbar is no longer just a place to store quick launch icons and view open windows.  It now provides functionality in the form of Jump Lists, which allow you to select your most frequently opened files or links from the apps you have \"pinned\" on the taskbar.  The clock and calendar are improved and the Show Desktop icon is now integrated in the far right corner.  Other desktop enhancements include Aero Peek, Aero Shake, Snap, new themes and wallpapers.  You also get gadget support.  All of these features combine to create a much improved and enjoyable desktop experience.\n\nLIBRARIES\nWindows 7 introduces a new feature called libraries.  Previously, your system had shortcuts to My Documents, My Music, My Pictures, etc. which had files residing in only those specific folders.  Files can now reside anywhere on your system and be organized inside libraries.  It's similar to how many music and photo applications organize files.\n\nNETWORKING\nEven as good as XP was, networking was cumbersome.  Windows 7 makes connecting two or more Windows 7 systems together easy, using HomeGroup.  This enables easy sharing of files and devices.  One downside is that HomeGroup is only supported between Windows 7 systems.  File transfer performance between computers has been vastly improved and connecting to a wireless network has never been easier on a Windows machine.\n\nSECURITY\nSecurity in Windows 7 is good and comes with Windows Firewall and Defender. Still, you'll probably want to invest in a more comprehensive Internet security suite, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Norton-Internet-Security-2010/dp/B002L7BR20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Norton Internet Security 2010</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Kaspersky-Internet-Security/dp/B002I0HJRM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Kaspersky Internet Security</a>. User Account Control (UAC) has been tweaked in order to give user accounts more flexibility in controlling their own security as well as providing more detailed information so the user can make better decisions about whether to allow certain actions. Coming from XP however, it is still annoying and I choose to turn it off. Also, in Windows 7 Ultimate, you can encrypt entire hard drives as well as external portable storage devices, like USB thumb drives. Though this is a welcome integrated feature, much of the functionality can be found in a popular open-source program called TrueCrypt. If you want encryption but not multi-language support, you could just get Windows 7 Home Premium and use TrueCrypt.\n\nPOWER MANAGEMENT\nPower management has been improved overall and you should be able to squeeze more battery life out of your laptop, even when using your DVD drive.  Sleep and resume has also been improved.  XP wasn't always consistent when entering or resuming from sleep mode, but Windows 7 has been perfect.\n\nWINDOWS MEDIA CENTER\nI've only briefly played around with WMC but it looks promising.  It has some fun options for media, especially when you're connected to the Internet.  It may even be an adequate replacement for component DVR's should you choose to use it as the centerpiece to your entertainment center.  The biggest advantage for me is that Windows 7 now includes a DVD decoder.  This means that I can now watch DVD's natively.  WMC is available in all Windows 7 editions except Starter.\n\nWINDOWS XP MODE\nFor applications that ran in XP, but won't on 7, there is now XP Mode.  It isn't perfect and your system has to have virtualization support and turned on.  Go to your system BIOS to check.  If supported, then install Windows Virtual PC and Windows XP Mode.  Check your hardware if you intend to use XP Mode.  XP Mode is only available in&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Windows-7-Professional/dp/B002DHLVII/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Windows 7 Professional</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Windows-7-Ultimate/dp/B002DHGMVY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Windows 7 Ultimate</a>&nbsp;editions.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nIf you're an XP holdout, like I was, I recommend upgrading. Vista SP2 users may have less reason to upgrade but might want to just for the changes to the taskbar and the UAC improvements. For users who don't need to use their computers in a corporate environment, then Windows 7 Home Premium edition is a good choice. I'm guessing most power users will choose Professional, which adds XP Mode and Domain Join. Ultimate also adds drive encryption and multi-language support. I suggest a clean install for best results. If you're a Mac OS X user, there is probably nothing in Windows 7 compelling enough for you to consider switching.\n\nSUMMARY\nWindows 7 is the premium Microsoft OS that Windows users have been waiting for.  It's fast, secure, stable, visually appealing and fun to use.  Windows 7 will make your old system feel fresh and new again.  New system owners with Windows 7 pre-loaded can feel confident that they're getting the best Windows OS ever produced.", "summary": "Here Comes Windows 7", "unixReviewTime": 1256169600}

The price was so low (compared to Adobe Illustrator, the only competition) that examples of Corel would show up in ordinary office documents, like the \"Word-Art\" equivalents as headlines.\n\nBut that was then. Nowadays Corel is, unfortunately, a second-string company, eclipsed by the Adobe Empire. But also the market has changed. There are millions of digital photographers, seduced by the promise of \"No developing - pictures immediately.\" That's a market that's served by plenty of programs these days, and it's not as easy as it once was to make a name for yourself.\n\nThe market has several free and low-cost options which are simplified versions of major programs like Photoshop. Photoshop is my weapon of choice, but I'd be the first to admit that it's way too complicated for the average snap-shooter to understand. In many cases people just want to remove red-eye from flash, and have some easy way to sort their pictures.\n\nEven Photoshop Elements is over the heads of many users, so the best choice for one's mythical \"grandparents\" are those free and low-cost programs for under $50. There are numerous options, including photo manipulating programs that come for free to download, or free with an operating system or camera. To succeed in this area a program will have to be better than the others.\n\nUnfortunately Corel Paint Shop Photo Express just isn't different enough. Other reviewers have compared it to Picasa (free) and other cheap options. The interface simplifies tasks, but so do the interface in many similar programs. Free programs like Windows Live Photo Gallery and Picasa have advanced features like face recognition, which I couldn't find in the Corel offering.\n\nSo why is Corel's offering here? My only guess is that some unscrupulous salespeople in the big electronic stores will mention to a new purchaser of a Windows 7 computer that \"it doesn't come with Photo-Editing software.\" They then point the buyer to a row of Photo-Editing software that they can sell to the unsuspecting, because you can download Windows Live Photo Gallery from Microsoft for free. It's not in Windows 7 so that other companies can get a shot at this market, but I think you'll find that the Microsoft offering is better than Corel's.\n\nSo, sorry, yet another voice against this program.

Toast 10 just starts Exporting ALL THE SONGS (to fill up your hard drive with songs you don't want), and way too fast for good quality.  With Toast 7 you just: Insert a CD, drag it to the Toast window, and then CHOOSE THE SONGS you want to Export, and then choose High Quality.\n\n2.  The reason I tried Toast 10 was that I needed to Export from one Super CD at 24/96, but there are NO options for quality or bitrates on Toast 10 AT ALL!!  The Toast 10 User Manual does not mention Exporting either.  With Toast 7 you can Export music from a CD at any bit or rate you chose, up to 64 kHz/64 Bits.\n\n3.  Toast 7 makes perfect CDs every time.  I literally have NOT ended up with a \"coaster\" since about three computers ago, over 10 years ago.  I do use good blanks, but every blank I have tried has burned perfectly.\n\n4.  With Toast 7 you can EASILY change the space between tracks from 0 to 8 seconds.  Zero seconds between tracks is essential for concept albums... Everything from Pink Floyd's the Wall to Disney's Alice In Wonderland Soundtrack, plus Classical Symphonies and Piano Concertos, and a few Tomita CDs, etc...\n\n5.  Toast 7 still works perfectly with Snow Leopard 10.6.8 which is the BEST Mac OS ever... Snow Leopard is Lean and Powerful and able to run many older programs that the newer Mac Operating Systems cannot run. When I am required to install Mavericks to sync my new iPhone 5, I am going to partition a new hard drive to boot from both Snow Leopard AND Mavericks.  There's just too many things about Mavericks that are not cool, and too many things about Snow Leopard that are still essential!!\n\n6.  Toast 7 worked perfectly on my iMac G5 running Tiger.  And it works perfectly on my 2008 Mac Pro running Snow Leopard.", "summary": "Toast 7 really is 100 x better than Toast 10.", "unixReviewTime": 1384041600}

Honestly, you can load this on your computer and figure it out within minutes without looking at any directions. At least I did.\n\nInstallation was self explanatory, the program has many different functions and effects.

You can add music, video or pictures and you can upload the video to your computer, burn a dvd, up send it straight to the internet, to Facebook, Youtube and the like.\n\nI will say this, as I stated before, this is my fourth version of this software, and the there hasn't been much change with the effects that I've noticed, so for me that is a little disappointing. It would have been nice if they had added some new title, transition or video effects, but they are the same ones that have been there since x4 I believe. However, I still prefer some of them to Cyberlink, though I do prefer Cyberlink's title effects. I get a little frustrated with the title effects in Corel\n\nI've also read other reviews from customers that have had trouble burning video to DVD. I've not done much of that, most of my videos go straight to internet, so I can't speak much to that.\n\nThe price is favorable to Cyberlink however, about $15-$20 cheaper.\n\nIf you're looking for something simple and user friendly with some fun effects, this is a good program.

I began using it in 1990 when it was Norton Commander - a menu system for DOS -  and stuck with it through almost all its incarnations. At some point, maybe seven or eight years ago, it became bloated and I began using free products, which worked fine without slowing the computer to a crawl - but I missed the full scans and features in Norton that I always found so trustworthy.\n\nSix years ago, I switched to a Mac and didn't go back to Norton. I used nothing for a while since Macs are less likely to be hacked, but that made me very nervous. I installed the free version of Avast and used it until a Mac-savvy friend who was trying to speed my old Mac back up told me I really needed Norton for Mac. (Indeed there was a disk-filling virus in that machine that only Norton was able to catch - Avast was unaware of it.) He told me to run full scans regularly - not just the quickies - and I did that, too.)\n\nWhen I got a new Mac earlier this year, my Norton was expiring so I went back to Avast for a while.

The application stopped working for me over the weekend.  Launching MyDVD put me into a never-ending loop of Windows Installer popping up.  I haven't touched the configuration of EMC-10.  Trying a repair in Control Panel | Add/Remove programs failed asking for files on a network.  I can no longer create DVDs without getting one of many obscure error codes.  The knowledgebase article at Roxio support about the installer loop said I needed to completely uninstall the product from my PC and reinstall.  The uninstall took forever because of the myriad of components EMC-10 installed without a unified uninstaller.  I am definitely NOT reinstalling this software.  I have never had an experience like this with any software package I've installed.  No way I am putting up with it.  I will be requesting an RMA today.  I am going to try Adobe instead.  At least they have a 30-day trial without having to pay up-front.  ZERO STARS!\n\n[Original review:]\nI downloaded the install for EMC-10 and was able to install the software, get it to run without crashing and produce a nice DVD from movie clips and a photo slideshow complete with background music.  This is the only part of the suite I've used so far and it worked brilliantly.  I would even say it was \"quick\" and I am using a Dell 9300 laptop with a Pentium M 1.6GHz processor and only 1GB of RAM.  I live in fear of trying the other parts of the application until I upgrade to 2GB.\n\nThe DVD burning and editing went much faster than MyDVD 5.5 and actually worked unlike MyDVD 9 (see below).  The end product is really good looking with only a few issues.  The things I don't like about the final DVD product is that the main menu music will not play for more than 60 seconds and the highlighted menu suffers from all kinds of aliasing problems with the font.  I also noticed the first few notes of any background music for a menu is lost.  The video quality is very nice taken from Motion JPEG files and 3ivx MPEG-4 files from a Canon 850is and Flip video camera, respectively.  The background music sounds great encoded as AC-3.\n\nThe nightmare was all before getting EMC-10 installed when I upgraded from MyDVD 5.5 to MyDVD 9.  Today a software package is no good without a good website, documentation and tech support.  So, while this part might not seem relevant I would beg to differ.  First, I had no clue that EMC-10 included MyDVD 10 or I certainly would not have bought MyDVD 9.  Nothing in the EMC-10 product pages indicated MyDVD was inside and version 10.  I also didn't know that MyDVD 9 would not support the files recorded from my Flip video camera.  Once again, nothing on the website saying that it does not support 3ivx MPEG-4.  Nothing on the website indicated any of this.  I figured it out reading the forums from other users.\n\nIf anything does go wrong with EMC-10 I already know I am hosed trying to use their website, documentation or support.  I am still waiting for a response from their customer support on my refund for MyDVD 9.  The instructions on their website for getting a refund don't work at all.  It can't even find my order number.\n\nFive stars for the product features that I've used and minus two stars for the website behind the product.\n\n[Update:] Roxio has a click-to-chat feature on their website.  I got a service rep right away and he gave me a phone number to call Digital River - the Roxio online store.  I called the number and after about 3-4 minutes on hold talked to a friendly agent who promptly sent me to a link where I clicked a couple of buttons to get my refund.  I got an email today confirming my refund for MyDVD 9.  No questions asked.  If only my call later with Comcast had gone so easy :-).", "summary": "I seem to be one of the lucky ones?", "unixReviewTime": 1199750400}

Like most people, I find I can talk a lot faster than I type (and with fewer errors. I've been using Dragon NaturallySpeaking for years, through several different versions, and I can understand the frustration some people feel when it comes to this software. Yes, it has made my computer crash on occasion. Yes, I've run into all sorts of other problems with it. Yes, it was very annoying when I was relying on it to help me get through National Novel Writing Month (or NaNoWriMo for short, a month when, like thousands of others, I attempted to complete a 50,000-word novel in just 30 days), and it inexplicably stopped working into the second week. Yet I keep going back to Dragon, and I keep paying for upgrades. Why? Because this is the best voice-recognition software on the planet.\n\nI am dictating this review using Dragon NaturallySpeaking 11.5 Premium. This is not the software that I'm reviewing, which is the Home Edition. I am also not using the headset that came with the software, but I am using another cheap headset. Two things that I've learned from my years of using Dragon NaturallySpeaking: although the premium version costs significantly more, it is definitely worth paying extra for; and you might as well throw out the headset that the program comes with, because you get much better results with headsets that cost about $30-$50.\n\nThe main advantage I found with the premium edition is that it can read text to you. This is invaluable to a writer in the editing stage, because sometimes I will hear things when the program reads something back to me that I missed when I read it myself. For example, it's very easy to miss repeated words or phrases when you read, but they do stand out when you hear them. I don't know if the premium edition is also less buggy. It seems that way to me, but I can't be sure.\n\nI've heard people say they been frustrated with Dragon NaturallySpeaking's customer service. This surprises me, because I've never had a problem with it. In fact, I've always found the people they employ to be well spoken, courteous and helpful. Perhaps I've just been lucky. I do find that Nuance calls a little too often in an effort to get me to buy Dragon NaturallySpeaking accessories and other products that they sell, but these conversations have also been quite courteous. Again, that has been my experience. Your experience may differ.\n\nWhenever a writing friend of mine tells me that he or she is experiencing carpal tunnel syndrome, fibromyalgia, or something else that makes typing difficult, I recommend the latest premium edition of Dragon NaturallySpeaking. As far as I know, so far they've all been very happy with the software too.\n\nThis isn't to say the software is trouble-free and that you won't experience any problems. I think it's reasonable to assume that the program will occasionally stop working or possibly cause your computer to freeze up. When this happens, simply reboot. Remember to save your work along the way, so you don't lose much if you have to reboot. Hopefully like me, you'll find that Dragon Naturally Speaking is worth putting up with these frustrations.\n\nOh, and in case you were wondering, that month I completed my NaNoWriMo first draft in three weeks thanks to the huge chunk of the manuscript I was able to write before Dragon NaturallySpeaking conked out on me. I spent a year editing it, and the book is scheduled to be released this summer.", "summary": "Love Dragon Naturally Speaking, but not crazy about the \"home\" editions", "unixReviewTime": 1340236800}

(I'm using Windows 7, on a pretty fast computer, with all Windows updates current.)\n\nI had no problems with the program.  It installed with no problems, checked for updates (none), found various copies of my 2010 tax file, allowed me to select one of them.  I quickly reviewed the imported 2010 info, and it all looked correct.\n\nI don't use the \"import from Quicken\" feature, because I find that it sometimes causes problems.  Instead, I create reports in Q that I export in TXF format, which I can then import into TT.  This worked fine.  I couldn't download my brokerage & mutual fund information yet, obviously, since that will not be available until late Jan or early Feb.  Same with the W2 info.  Instead I entered some info based on my records, just to go through the preliminary calculation.  Everything worked as expected.  BUT note that some forms (e.g., Sch D) aren't finalized yet, are waiting for the IRS.\n\nOne note: Intuit pushes the more expensive Premier version for those with investment income, but you don't need it unless your situation is rather complex.  If all you have is mutual funds and some brokerage stock/bond transactions, you're likely to be fine with Deluxe.  (If you have option trading, you'll have to look into the details, Deluxe might still be fine.)\nNOTE:  Thought it might be helpful to briefly report here what TT says about why they recommend Premier; they help if the following apply to you: Unsure of your capital gains? Don't know your cost basis? Confused by ESPP sales?\n\nAlso note that in the past I've used H&R Block (aka TaxCut), and have found it to be about as good as TT.  If I were paying money, I'd get the one that's cheaper.  (I get TT discounts from my fund company, hence it's cheaper for me.)\n\nI'll update this review in Feb after I've done more with the program.  (See below.)\n\nQuick note on hidden privacy option:\nJust noticed that Intuit hid a privacy option nice and deep.  Go into Help-About, and select the Privacy tab.  You'll see a box to permit sharing metrics about your usage.  Seems perfectly reasonable and harmless, but it annoys me that they felt it was ok to hide it like that.  So guess what, I unchecked it.  You can decide for yourself, I don't think it's a big deal either way.\n\n1/12/12 Update:\n\nSince my review above I've been able to download the state program, and it did fine with my preliminary information.  Full test will wait until I have all my data.\n\nI ran into a problem with W-2 imports: the program won't let me enter cents in the box 1 & box 5 fields, just whole dollars, but then the import fails saying data mismatch.  Interesting.  I spent about 40 minutes in a chat session with someone in tech support, who was unable to provide any useful information at all.  (Began with the usual \"it works on my machine\".  I used to say \"ok, then ship me your machine\".)  Intuit brags about the excellent US-based tech support, but I was unimpressed.\n\n2/17/12 Update:\n\nThere have been many bug fix updates over the last few weeks (at least 5, maybe more), which is good in the sense that they're delivering fixes quickly as they have them.  (No one's found a way to create bug-free software yet, of course!)  I've not run into any problems lately, and the W-2 problem I mentioned above was also fixed (I can't fully test it, not having multiple paychecks).\n\nOne good thing to report: my state tax return (MA) took very little time to do and review: the initial data entry captures just about all the useful information that transfers neatly to the state return, and all I had to was to go through the yes/no stuff and then review the return.\n\nOne area TT could improve: the entry of capital gain transactions is unnecessarily tedious, requiring that you go through several screens for each transaction.  This became particularly annoying when I had to go through them to correct a set of errors I found in my data (incorrect records).  It would be so much easier to have an option to enter the transactions on a table.  (No, the \"quick entry\" spreadsheet doesn't do it for me, it's an ugly user interface in my opinion, makes it too easy to make errors.)\n\nOn another note: I used TT to do some what-if calculations related to getting a Schedule K-1 from an S-corp (with \"material participation\"), and found it quite useful.  When you get to this kind of thing the program doesn't really help you much, you have to know the tax laws and rules  (or learn quickly!)  in order to do the right things.  But at least I was able to have the program do the calcs for me, which saved me a ton of time.\n\nIn summary, I found this year's TT to be a pretty good program, worth the 4 stars I initially gave it, with enough shortcomings to fall short of a 5-star product.", "summary": "worked fine for me", "unixReviewTime": 1324425600}

Sigh, there is precious little to justify spending up to $100 on a \"new\" version.  It looks, acts and works virtually identical to last year's version.  As expected, the glitches some reviewers experienced in early releases have been addressed ... Quicken forces the software to do an upgrade to the latest generation before you can even use it.  So far it has updated itself to Ver. 8 of the 2013 app.\n\n4. I was shocked when I saw the price of checks from Quicken.  I recall 250 checks being about $30.  Now they are about $150.  For 250 sheets of paper?!?!?!??!?\n\n5. Since I got my first smartphone a couple of years ago I was amazed that Quicken didn't have a smartphone app.  Okay, now they finally do and it is so useless I can't believe it.  It does NOTHING.  You can't withdraw, deposit, pay, or any other of the most basic functions of banking from it.  From what I can see it tells you what your balance is (but no, it really doesn't ... my checking account has an overdraft line of credit, and Quicken includes that in calculating my cash balance).  So if I have $2000 in available funds and $4000 in overdraft protection, Quicken tells me I have $6000 liquid cash available.  There is NO way to adjust that.\n\n6. More on the useless smartphone app ... I installed it on the first day of the month.  It told me what my income-to-date and expenditures-to-date were.  FOR THE ONE DAY!!!!  I can't set it to tell me what those values are for the past 30, 60, 90 days or year-to-date or any other useful function; only what they are for THIS month.  Useless.\n\n7. More on the smartphone app ... oh, never mind.  It was the #1 reason I upgraded to Ver. 2013 and I will probably end up never using it.\n\n8. I suspect some of the less-than-positive reviews were due to early release glitches in the app.  So far Quicken 2013 has \"upgraded\" itself 8 times and I find Ver 8 to be as stable as I could expect.\n\nIf I had to give up every app I own except one, the one I would keep would be Quicken.  If you have previous versions I doubt it you will find anything substantial to justify buying this newer version.  If you have never used Quicken, I think you will end up like me finding it indispensable.", "summary": "Still an excellent app, but is the upgrade worth it?", "unixReviewTime": 1354147200}

It's always been THE app for artists who want to recreate the look of natural media within the digital space. I was delighted when I received this new version to review.\n\nOver the years, Painter has been moving toward a close compatibility with Photoshop. Not only can you import/export Painter files to Photoshop, but the GUI has also moved from a more idiosyncratic one to one that mirrors the thinking behind PSD. And Painter's natural-media library is so extensive, the app is now beyond compare -- there isn't another app out there that really competes in terms of media replication.\n\nI still use Photoshop and Painter for my digital art. Both apps have their strengths, and Corel has done a great job of ensuring an almost seamless workflow twixt the two apps. Photoshop can be used to make great digital art, especially if you're pretty good with creating brushes, using blend modes and creating texture overlays. But it can't beat Painter for mimicking natural media at a basic \"stroke\" level. If you want your digital work to look like watercolors, pastels, oils, etc., that have been rendered \"by hand,\" Painter is the tool for you.\n\nBy the way, if your art mainly consists of pencil and/or pen work, the much cheaper&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Autodesk-SketchBook-Pro-7-Download/dp/B00LH6ZWIG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Autodesk SketchBook Pro 7 [Download</a>] is a great option for that. I've used and reviewed SketchBook in the past, and it's great for line work and broad color overlays/fill-ins. I don't use SketchBook  that often because 1) I already own Painter and it does the line work just as well as SketchBook and 2) Painter's coloring and paint-modeling options are greater than Sketchbook's. But if you don't need the extensive range of natural-media effects Painter offers and you're basically looking for a very good sketch app, keep SketchBook in mind.\n\nBTW, I use a Wacom with Painter and I should mention a tablet greatly aids in the natural media reproduction. That being said, I have used a mouse for Painter and still gotten very good results. But if you get Painter and you're serious about taking advantage of all it can deliver, you'll probably want to invest in a graphics tablet at some point. So figure in the cost of that when you purchase this program. (Even a less-expensive tablet will greatly improve the look of your strokes within the app.)\n\nSUMMARY: Painter is not a cheap app, so if you just need an app that will allow you to create line work and/or very flat artwork, Photoshop and SketchBook will work for you. But if you're an artist looking to recreate natural media to a pretty amazing degree, Painter is worth the money. Nothing else currently available can best this app at what this app sets out to do.", "summary": "Best natural-media app by far", "unixReviewTime": 1412899200}

I've used McAfee for years.  I especially like the Quick Clean feature that cleans up my computer's unnecessary temporary files along with clearing the cache and history and other things that take up space and can slow down a computer.\n\nI was hesitant this time when I bought it though, because it was for a download with a subscription code card number.  I've always used a CD for the install in prior years.  When I recently bought a new laptop, I separately bought an external disc drive since my laptop doesn't contain one.  Who knew that things I used to install via a CD are pretty much now only offered as downloads, online.  This is one of those things.  I was nervous trying a new way to install my McAfee Internet Security but I worried needlessly.  It was quite easy and I didn't run into any problems whatsoever.  The product works as it should and like I expected it to.\n\nI do want to mention that I think some people said if you already have a subscription to McAfee, when you install a new version, it extends your subscription for another year from the end date of your old subscription.  I didn't find that to be true.  My previous subscription, that came with my new laptop, was due to run out on (not sure of the date now), let's say, 3/26.  I installed the new subscription on 3/24/2014.  It didn't extend my subscription to 3/26/2015.  Instead, it subscribed me from the date of installation, 3/24 for one year, to 3/24/2015.  So, if you still have a week or two left on your current subscription, I would advise not installing the new one before then.  It's not the worst thing in the world but, it appears you will then lose that week or two that were still remaining on your old subscription.\n\nI do not find that my computer slows down at all on my new laptop.  On my much older PC that runs Vista, there is a noticeable slow down when McAfee is scanning of updating while I'm using the computer.  But, that computer is slow even when nothing is happening to interfere with its performance so I guess Anything that's running in the background would make it operate even slower.  On my laptop that runs Windows 8.1, I find no problem whatsoever.

Nancy Drew must discover why a phantom horse is seen every night whilst trouble follows immediately afterward via property destruction.\n\nINITIAL SCORE: 83\n\nCHARACTERS:\n\nDave Gregory : One of the most handsome men involved with ND games thus far, this ranch foreman is shy and seems to want to be more than friends with Nancy.  It never got weird or anything.  He lied to me, but I don't think I was invested enough in him to take it personally.\n\nTex Britten  : The ranch head wrangler that has no likeable personality.  Grunting out how I might fail goes only so far with me.\n\nShorty Thurmond: He looks a lot like my brother-in-law [balding & pronounced lips], so I had my guard up against him immediately.  He was an odd-looking dude. I don't know why picking the wrong vegetables were grounds for expulsion from the ranch. Don't you think the ranch owners should take personal responsibility for placing a novice with the obviously crucial task of picking out their food properly? Utterly ridiculous. They should be ashamed.\n\nMary Yazzie : A lot of reviewers didn't like her, but I thought she was fine. The love affair with Tex is understandable since both didn't get out too much.\n\nBess & George : The \"stuck in the airport business\" might seem overplayed, but judging from the realities of air travel life now, I would not doubt it could happen.  Between these two & the Hardy Boys, this game featured more hint systems than any other ND game out on the market. I can't say I liked it because I wanted to discover sleuthing for myself,  yet it was probably for the best since half the puzzles would have taken an extra four hours just by mental confusion. So in the end, I accepted it.\n\nEd & Bet Rawley: Owners of the Shadow Ranch I had mentioned early. Ed was annoying when he downplayed every single comment Bet made regarding Nancy & the adventure. He constantly acted as if Bet  was irritating him. I see this a lot with couples and I refuse to accept this as functional behavior. I give HER credit for the realism though!\n\n CUMUL SCORE: - 2 = 81\n\nSCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:\nThe Magnificent Seven score was pretty enticing; made you feel triumphant! ha, ha. The Arizona desert had a beautiful appeal. The ghost town wasn't as great as other reviewers made it out to be. I didn't find it spooky nor engaging.  Lonely? yes\n\nCUMUL SCORE: + 2 = 83\n\nPUZZLES/MINI-GAMES: I liked the trivia challenge in the corral. Nice touch!  The chicken coop wire puzzle was interesting. The slot machine at Cappy's seemed unnecessary but was fun to play.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: Even = 83\n\nADVENTURE ENDING: I guessed the culprit!!  The endgame [switching colored stones] seemed a rather hard concept for anyone to pick up without a walkthrough.  Again, I felt as if I invested all that energy into the story and there was no character payoff explanations on what happened in the weeks following [other than a 30 second update]. The actual treasure was a wonderful climax!!  I haven't seen that is a ND adventure before.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: + 1 = 84\n\n* PART 2 *\n\nI try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to\ntake weeks! Well, it took me four days [14 hours] and I gave myself a\nDetective Score Of : 68\n\nMy Strong Points: I did reasonably well on the ranch chores, guessed the culprit [which I have done in 7 of the 14 games thus far], and stayed steady with the games'  pacing. I navigated the cliff dwellings maze real well.\n\nMy Weak Points: Walkthroughs were important to me in the second half, I got to admit. I stumbled on the bead pattern puzzle for some reason [forgot there was an email solution from my best friends], and I was stuck on one errant ingredient with the cake for nearly an hour!\n\nOVERALL GAME SCORE: 84 + 68/ 2 = 76 [ B ]\n\nBOTTOMLINE: This ranked # 2 in Best Game by the fans, but I thought it  was just simply average as ND games go.  I tend to get bored more easily when the adventure is not scary, but that is just my personal taste.

So needless to say, I was VERY hesitant about upgrading to Quicken 2009.\n\nWhen it comes to the world of personal finance software, we as the general public have very limited choices.  I've used Quicken since the DOS days and moved over to Money, then back to Quicken.  My most recent version was 2006.  I booted it up and it told me it was time to upgrade because they will stop supporting online downloads come 4/30/09.  Initially I was pretty hacked off...like a lot of others here.  Then I took a deep breath, and did the math.  I think my Deluxe version cost me about $20 somewhere (eBay perhaps??) so let's do the math together shall we?  $20/3 years is about $6.67 a year.  Holy Break The Bank Batman!!  Seriously people. Quit griping.  How about you not drink 2 Starbucks all year long and put it in your \"Upgrade Quicken\" jar.\n\nThis upgrade cost me $39 direct from Quicken and took 17 minutes to download.  So let's do the math for the next 3 years, shall we? $39/3 years is a wallet busting $13 a year!!  Skip your $5 footlong at Subway 3 times all year long and you can afford the upgrade...amazing isn't it?\n\nThe upgrade was flawless on my XP machine.  Double-clicked the start-up icon and away we went.  It found my previous version and un-installed it, installed the new version and ran for the first time.  It immediately found an update so I accepted it.  After the update, the program opened to the main screen.  All of my files imported flawlessly and I was downloading my newest transactions immediately thereafter.\n\nOne of the best improvements is how you can copy digital images into the register.  In my old version, I had to save the file to my desktop and then add it through a few clicks.  Now all I have to do is right click the image, click copy, open Quicken attachment and paste from clipboard.  Genius I tell you!\n\nThe interface has a very \"gel\" \"XP\" look to it.  I'm not a real big fan of that look, but I'm not going to rate it 1 or 2 stars because of it.\n\nAll in all, the upgrade, download, install and running of the program worked great for me.

It then asks if you are a beginner, intermediate or advanced computer user.  It then sets up the software based on your answers.  Though advanced, I choose intermediate since I do not want to think about computers when I get home.  I think the setup turned out perfect for me.\n\nThe newest version scans almost twice as fast as BitDefender 2009 and is far less resource intensive.  I always thought BitDefender was efficient relative to other internet software, but 2010 has made another jump in performance.  I was able to play Fallout 3, run a scan, and not notice a problem.\n\nI like Total Security over other versions of BitDefender since it has all the features I want such as a registry optimizer and file backup.  These are not available on other versions of BitDefender.\n\nOf course, \"Does the software protect well?\"  Results vary between different testers, but in general BitDefender does very well relative to others.  But I work part time in IT security and I know keeping your software up to date and running scans regularly is more far more important than the type of software.  Caveat, I do not use the parental controls or spam filter.\n\nSo why not five stars?  I do not think there is such a thing as five star internet security software.  All security software will have problems running on some computers.  I have had Norton and TrendMicro not work on home computers, and read cases of Kapursky, and McAfee not running on other computers.  I am sure BitDefender 2010 will have problems on some computers.\n\nThe main advice I tell people is go to an internet security site and try an evaluation copy.  If it works and you like it, then buy a copy from Amazon where it will be cheaper.  You can usually just plug the registration key in the software package into your evaluation copy.  I have tried recent copies of McAfee, Norton, Kapursky, McAfee, TrendMicro and Avast.  But with great software with a price for two years what others charge for one year (except Avast), I think you should start with BitDefender.\n\nUpdate - Works great with Windows 7.  And I am 80% sure a problem on my computer that I had to solve for the upgrade to work was due an evaluation copy of Norton 360 I tried earlier this year.

You see, I have both Mac's and PC's in my home, and at various times may use either depending upon my mood and/or whether it seems that I've not used one system enough lately (so that it's batteries get charged/discharged enough to keep them useful, etc.)\n\nWith that said, I do admit that my primary realm is that of Windows PC's, and not so much the Mac.  I have a lovely little Macbook that I keep up-to-date with patches and system upgrades, and again, on more than the odd occasion I pull out the Macbook and enjoy using it to surf through my regular stomping grounds.  Doing so lets me stay familiar with the Mac and gives me a chance to see some sites with slightly different results (when, for example, a site renders better in one browser than another).\n\nIn any case, I saw an opportunity to check out the Smart Surfing for Mac software by Trend Micro and opted to see what the experience of installing 'security software' on the Mac is like compared to doing the same thing on a PC.\n\nOn a PC, again, as hinted at in some of the commercials we've been bombarded with (this time from the Apple side), surfing the web without protection of some sort is a very dangerous proposition.  There are too many vulnerabilities that can be taken advantage of if the computer user (PC user) hasn't kept their system updated and patched.  Regardless, those words shouldn't be taken to mean that in reality Mac's or *nix based systems are less vulnerable to malware as all systems have vulnerabilities, but because so many computer systems in use in the world are 'PC's' the PC world presents a bigger target and offers people like me much more opportunity to be familiar with internet security software.\n\nMac's have their share of vulnerabilities including vulnerabilities due to third party software (Adobe, Sun JAVA, etc.) and even the underlying software.  Because of that, it's still a very good idea to have internet security software installed on your system, no matter what software you prefer.  Which brings us back to the purpose of this particular review, the Trend Smart Surfing for Mac software, and whether or not it should be your software of choice in this area.\n\nNow, I must admit, I don't have the familiarity with the choices of software packages that are available on a Mac.  On a PC I could probably name a half dozen internet security/anti-malware packages without even thinking about it.  With a few minutes thought I could probably add another half dozen, and with a few minutes to search the web I'd probably find another dozen that I just couldn't remember when I was under pressure.  On a Mac the list of software that I'm aware of is much, much smaller, to the point of being nearly non-existent.  I count that as my own fault, and beg your indulgence, as the list of programs I've actually used for this purpose (on a Mac at least) is in the neighborhood of 2 (which I won't bother naming here).  One was open source software and another was a commercial program provided by my employer for employees to use on their systems.\n\nThe open source software was a very simple program to install and was equally easy to remove/uninstall.  The commercial software was a bit more difficult to figure out how to uninstall and that threw me for a bit of loop, compliments of the installer for the Trend Smart Surfing for the Mac product.  The installer for the Trend Smart Surfing product will insist that any existing security software be uninstalled, but, in a more than irritating flaw (in my book) the installer doesn't tell you what product it has found that needs to be removed.  It would be very, very helpful to open an install log that notes the software that was found as doing so would help the user find out what they need to do if they wish to remove the old product and proceed with this one.  Eventually I got past the issue once I found the uninstall command script that I needed to run to remove the originally installed product.\n\nI'd swear that in the past installs and uninstalls of software on the Mac were basically a case of dragging and dropping the installed software onto the system or into the recycle bin, but that wasn't at all the case with my old security software.  Ugh.  While this isn't really the fault of the Trend Smart Surfing product, I note that the Trend product's install disc showed a menu choice for 'Uninstall' in it's menu and that leaves me thinking that apparently I'm going to have to keep the CD/DVD handy well into the future just so I can put it back into the system and use that option when I'm ready to remove the product (if that ever happens).  I'm guessing there's probably some uninstall scripts that can be downloaded and used if needed, but I hope not to ever need to find that out, or at least hope not to find it out when I'm in a very frustrated state :-/\n\nOnce I removed the existing software the installer proceeded normally and the software installed itself just fine, up to the point that it was supposed to be registered.  At that point, Firefox (my default browser at the time) opened and refused to open the destination web site because, uh, the site certificate for the destination site was invalid.  What?!!?  Oops!  I guess Trend Micro forgot to update the certificate for that site, but that doesn't necessarily inspire confidence in the vendor, no?\n\nBeyond those issues I'd have to complain a little about the packaging.  The contents of the package are a small quick reference card (approx. 6 pages if you count it's cover), folded in thirds.  The folded page size is a bit bigger than that of a CD/DVD, but in reality it seems that the quick reference card could easily be resized into one that would fit easily into a more environmentally friendly CD/DVD sized case.  In addition to the quick reference card there's the disc that comes in a paper envelope with a label on the back that provides you with the required serial number.  Ok, not so bad in that area, but again, be sure to keep that number/case and disc handy well into the future.  That's it.  That's what in the box, which inspires the question of why is there a box?  A box with a bunch of empty space in it.  Totally unnecessary packaging which seems silly and wasteful.  I would note that the box features a 'Printed on Recycled Paper' logo which is encouraging, but it still seems unnecessary as a CD sized package (like an Audio CD) would easily do the job.\n\nOn the software product itself, it seems adequate and seems to be working, but in reality, as a fairly careful web surfer (I know, we all make typo's every now and then and wind up going to sites we didn't intend, and/or we get sent to sites that aren't what we expected after we've executed a web search) I don't tend to be going to sites that would set off alarms and opening dialog boxes questioning whether or not I wish to continue (and potentially damage my own system).  I want internet security software that works, but is not intrusive.  If the software gets in my way, it'll get turned off and become totally useless.\n\nThe big question is whether or not the software is worth the purchase price?  Despite the impression that some people have of Mac owners, I don't personally know Mac users that happily toss their money away on either hardware or software.  Just because Mac owners pay more for a quality computing product, that doesn't mean they want to keep doing that when it comes to additional software that they'll install on their systems.  Any way, in the case of the Trend Smart Surfing for Mac the product seems to deliver value at a reasonable level.  Not an overwhelming value, but a reasonable value for the product's sale price.\n\nIf you don't go with this product, please do understand that I heartily encourage any computer user that will ever connect their system to the internet or any other computer system to run anti-malware software on their systems.  Security is only as good as the weakest link in the chain and that weak link should not be YOU!", "summary": "I'm a PC and this is for Macs... oh, wait, I'm using a Mac...", "unixReviewTime": 1247356800}

If you hit that threshold, your standard Will ends up being a ticket for up to 2 years in probate. You still want a will when you do a living trust as sort of a catch-all, but with that you need the proper power of attorneys set up (note that was plural). The right kind of protection is a legal will, durable power of attorney for finances, directive for health care and caregiver instructions. Plus of course you want a Living Trust as the flag ship. I just learned all this YESTERDAY, while WillMaker was on my desk waiting to be used and reviewed. This version of WillMaker offers everything on the list I just gave, including a free one year subscription to Nolo's Living Trust service. That's huge and a a huge bargain, because a Living Trust is an updatable document that should be reviewed and refined as family situations change, hence the subscription.  The law office gave us their price sheet to set up all of these docs: $2,950, seriously. Considering all that goes into creating a fully protected and executable will and trust and all the rest, that's understandable for a local law office. But put that into a well-respected software package and you can save that huge fee if you understand the process.

You can buy either Win 8.1 or Win 7 OEM disks and do the free upgrade. In both cases make sure you get the \"with SP1\" versions to reduce the hassles.

I've had it for just about a month now and decided to review what I've experienced so far.\n\nInstallation: This should have been an easy simple process, and mostly it was but there were a few hiccups. The installation wizard gives you a choice between 32 bit or 64 bit and pretty much no guidance as to how to make that choice. The geeky part of me hit the 64 bit because well I figured I could use the extra memory access. Well, choosing 64-bit is not just hitting a button and then installing. The installation program actually has you leave the set-up process and locate another file to set-up. There is nothing inherently wrong with this, but it's not smooth and could cause an issue for those a little less tech inclined. The other issue is 64 bit Office has some compatibility issues, especially with add-ons. Since I am not using this in a work environment where huge files could benefit from the 64 bit advantages, I just went with 32 not to worry about it, and 64 2010 would not install with 2007 32 bit without spending more time online figuring out the tricks how to.\n\nFirst, I want to make a note about compatibility, I am not talking about OS compatibility but other versions of Office. Between my three computers, I have Office XP, 2007 and of course, 2010. In addition I have used 97 and 2003. Now getting 2007 to work happily with XP wasn't a problem. The two-coexist with no problems at all and seem to ignore the fact that the other exists. 2007 and 2010... this is not the case. It will allow you to install them both of course, but that's about where the cooperation begins. Yes, you can access files from either but each time you switch from 2007 or 2010 the other program wants to run a set-up configuration. This is not a slow process. Searching online I see you can install to a different folder and perhaps avoid some of these issues, but when I review a product, I do so as a standard user. I'll do the geeky stuff later.\n\nAfter the installation, I jumped into Word because that is the program I will use the most at home. I do a bit of creative writing so I have some fairly large, 100's of pages long, documents. Now the one thing I hated immediately is how much longer it takes me in 2010 to switch from one recent document to another. In 07 it's very easy, right off the \"Office Button\" and boom there it is. With 2010 I have to go to the File tab and then drop down to the Recent area since the default is a bunch of info on the document you are currently editing.  This info tab has a lot of info and a lot of utility as well to do things like change the compatibility of the document, add tags, permissions, a whole host of stuff that would be more useful to me in a work environment but at home, I just want my recent documents very handy. Fortunately, Windows 7 keeps track of that very well instead.\n\nOne very good feature that encounter in 2010 that almost makes up for this tiny little annoying thing I encountered above is the new search feature that lets preview you about 3 and half lines of the sentence of the word you are searching for is just awesome, I mean really awesome to see this list. There is a limitation though, at some point this new search future decides there are too many matches as a result, won't show you any of these partial sentences which is just so... sad.\n\nI also played around with Excel a bit, as I use that in work environments for formulas, pivot tables and just standard things that you would expect. The ribbon changes found in Word can also be found in Excel and the other programs, here is the thing though. The differences between 2007 and 2010 are rather minute. My complaints and praises could easily bother other people so it's a bit of a personal preference issue. If you are using the older versions, not 2007, then 2010 is as good a point as any to move on over and enjoy the expanded memory usages, extra rows and just generally easy to use features. You could also go 2007 and not have a problem. If you like 2007, like I do, but want easier ways to set permissions, compatibilities, share your work and, finally, have a chance to change around your toolbars and better customization in general, 2010 is for you... you're still going to have to use ribbons though which I don't mind one bit. For the rest of you using 2007, unless you have money to burn or a very specific need not being met, there isn't a whole lot to justify the cost.\n\nOh, I almost forget, being able to preview your past before you actually paste, that, that is almost as nice as the search preview and could be the tilting point for a number of you as you can monkey around with things before you paste and have to undo it what you just did. This is a time save and a very nice option.\n\nLastly, yes OneNote works with Win 7 64. I was one of those people who switched Win 7 64 and suddenly discovered that my OneNote \"printing\" capability was just gone. It was an unfortunate surprise for me anyway.\n\nThanks for your time!", "summary": "Not a Bad Update to 2007 but Just an Update", "unixReviewTime": 1284422400}

I was impressed with the VAST inprovements McAfee has made to their product line to the point that I have found myself recommending their products to people looking for a reasonable solution. With the move to 2009 I was anxious to see what other improvements McAfee has made. There are some updates and improvements, but these seem to be minor.\n\nI have two computers, one of which runs Vista Home Premium and the other runs XP Home. Both were running the 2008 version. On the XP box, the installation was smooth and seamless, and after a reboot all was well. The Vista machine had some issues, though, during the installation of each component, where it would complain about a file that either had an invalid path or that could not be overwritten. I was offered a Retry/Cancel dialog box, and in every case the Retry button worked, but having to click over and over again during installation was annoying. I am assuming it was because it was an upgrade, not a fresh install, though both machines were upgrades. After the Vista install was complete, there were no more headaches.\n\nI was pleased to see that my settings for the 2008 version were retained for the 2009 version.\n\nI noticed something unpleasant between the systems that grabbed my attention, but only because I was looking for differences. The memory usage on the Vista computer is MUCH lower than that on the XP system, for reasons unknown. That said, the performance does not seem to be appreciably different.\n\nOn the same note, I have noticed that with the 2009 version installed the XP system ran faster than it did with the 2008 version loaded. The Vista machine's performance seems to be unchanged.\n\nNext I will discuss the firewall, as that seems to be where the majority of noticeable changes have occurred. With the 2008 version, there were several settings for the firewall that could be made with the adjustment of a slider control. These level settings ranged between Off, Trusting, Standard, Tight, Stealth, and Lockdown (or some minor variation there of - I did not write these down before I upgraded). With the 2009 version, these have been replaced with just three slider settings - Automatic, Standard and Stealth. Lockdown is in a different area. The reduced number of options is not necessarily a bad thing, and I suspect it now matches the actual usage patterns that are prevalent in the software's usage. I always set mine to Stealth and saw no reason to change. When I tested the firewall for security, I was unable to locate a test that caused the firewall to fail, and I was pleased that the firewall prevented my computer from responding to any kind of probe or echo requests.\n\nI discovered a curiosity in the firewall's application filters. The filters allow you to set up access rules for any and all applications on your system which is very handy when you have a useful application that you want to keep from accessing the network (such as Acrobat Reader, in my case). After the upgrade several applications in the rule sets that were still loaded on my system were listed as no longer installed. I am not sure what happened there, and I deleted these errant rules. I believe these were probably cosmetic issues, but regardless it was something that drew my attention.\n\nThe antivirus seems to be virtually unchanged between the 2008 and 2009 versions. The antivirus is very thorough and stable, doing an excellent job of scanning the system. I discovered a check box in the AV settings, that allows you to specify minimal resource usage during a scan. The information help that comes with it states very clearly that AV scanning is a low-priority background task when this option is taken, and it seems to work very much as advertised. With this option checked, McAfee's AV is absolutely the slowest AV I have ever used (600,000 files in 3.5 hours), but it also is so gentle on system resources that it does not impact anything and you might not know it's running except for the animated scanning icon in the system tray.\n\nThe parental controls in McAfee's suite are, in my opinion, nearly useless. If you want to block anything, you have to specify that you want it blocked, so there is no pregenerated list of URLs. Keyword filtering is a more useful aspect of the filter system, yet it still requires some manual entry.\n\nI like the site advisor, which provides some clues as to the safety of the web sites you visit. It does not prevent you from going there, but it does tell you when you have found a potentially harmful site. That says that McAfee is tracking some kind of URL set, yet it does not make the set available to the parental control component which is unfortunate.\n\nThe antispam component does a fair job of catagorizing email, though I elected to turn it off because I use a different antispam product. With the standard settings, I find that determination of spam is a little trigger-happy but not unreasonable.\n\nI played with the \"Manage Network\" component and like the mapping of the network topology. Though it is not something I personally need, it is undoubtedly useful to system administrators who need to see the lay of the land at a quick glance.\n\nWith McAfee Internet Security installed on both machines, I have seen no appreciable issues and my systems are well protected. I like the firewall configuration and I really like the fact that the antivirus is so gentle on the system when scanning. The other components in the system - with the exception of the parental controls - are sufficient protection for home and SOHO users, though not all are features I use. I am comfortable recommending this package based on my positive experience with it - it is a fine solution for anyone wishing to protect their system without bringing it to its knees.", "summary": "Solid Contender", "unixReviewTime": 1222560000}

Norton has slightly improved over the past few years, but I still find McAfee to be bloated, intrusive, slow and determined to pound you into submission and renew it when your initial term is up. I also think McAfee is kind of sneaky in not making clearly apparent that you are signing up for an auto-renewal program. You can opt out of it, but it isn't necessarily intuitive or swift.\n\n The Cloud is everything these days and this program is downloaded from the Cloud. You get no physical media, which many will find disturbing. Download it, hopefully without any hiccups, install it, enter your registration code, which is on a card in the minimalist package and should not be lost, and you're ready to go. If everything works as planned.\n\n This kind of software is, in  my opinion, largely the exploitation of the technologically ignorant. Putting things very simply, if you practice safe computing which I will not describe here, but is fully described all over the internet, the odds of your contracting a true computer virus are low, almost to the point of non-existence. Likewise, there are many effective free or low-cost options available for those who invest the time and effort to research the issue.\n\n So a product like this is a security blanket. Yes, it will protect you from all manner of threats that, if you practice safe computing, you are unlikely to encounter.\n\n Operation of this version of McAfee is largely automatic. There is a significant performance hit when the program is scanning  which it does much of the time, though if you're brave enough, you can restrict it to certain times. Those with older computers or running limited RAM may encounter significant slowdowns.\n\n Overall, though I personally don't like the brand, the product does the job just as well as any of its direct competitors. I don't like it because of the endless notifications, warnings and attempts to get you to renew long before the initial term is over.\n\n Should you buy it? If you want it. Youll be just as protected with any of the other major and most of the minor players.\n\nJerry", "summary": "Its okay, but I prefer others", "unixReviewTime": 1420243200}

They were directly related to known issues with the eSATA interface of this Western Digital My Book Home 500 GB USB 2.0/FireWire 400/eSATA Desktop External Hard Drive WDH1CS5000N. Online research reveals an extended history of users experiencing a wide variety of performance issues with that hard drive's eSATA interface. In my case, when I switched from eSATA to USB 2, my Windows 7 immediately became stable and trouble free.\n\nMy other experiences in the upgrade from Vista to Windows 7 lead me to recommend this: don't wade into this upgrade unless you have confidence in your operating system troubleshooting kung fu. You'll probably need your best tricks should you have an obscure issue. But get through it...and Windows 7 is as good as any Windows operating system I've used (going back to Windows 3.1).\n\nEnd of update.

My experience: the benefits marginally outweigh the issues. But Windows 7 is not issue-free; don't consider unless you're a confident Windows troubleshooter.\n\nTechnology pundits wrote at length about Windows 7 in assessing the pre-release offering. Opinions abound, offered by both sycophantic Windows 7 fanboys and the zealous Windows haters (who seem to never tire of reminding Windows users that they are oh-so-cool with their overpriced Mac hardware or exotic distributions of Linux).\n\nMarket share alone tells the rest of the story: most of us --for whatever reasons-- are in a long term relationship with Windows operating systems at both home and work. If we're lucky, somebody else carries the upgrade decision and headaches of execution at work. As for home: even if we're in the market for a new computer (or just tired of Vista's quirks on an existing machine) and not yet ready to re-stock your entire applications catalog to go with Mac or Linux: then we're going to be dancing with Microsoft for a while.\n\nWhat follows are the highs and lows of one user's experience.\n\nThis review focuses on the upgrade process, which began the day after the regular release. I'm still exploring some of the interface features.\n\nCaution: mild geek-speak appears below:\n\nThis upgrade was for an 18-month old Dell XPS 420 desktop machine (similar, but not identical to the linked one. The machine receiving the upgrade holds a dual-core Intel E6850 CPU (3 GHZ), 4GB of RAM, two 500 GB (non-RAID) internal hard drives, an ATI Radeon HD 2600 XT graphics card with ethernet and audio integrated into the motherboard).\n\nA long-term problem on this machine has been a conflict between Vista and the graphics adapter preventing me from *ever* successfully updating the graphics drivers; some of the attempted work-arounds have been very painful...and all unsuccessful. This was my primary reason for choosing to go from Vista to 7 (and to be fair, this problem is as much ATI's fault as Vista's; ATI user forums provide abundant discussion showing I was not alone in this situation).\n\nPreparations for the upgrade took about an our to complete. My data files are regularly archived to an external hard drive, so this wasn't a big deal. If you're not as diligent about regular backups, you'll probably need more time.\n\nMy upgrade path (Vista Home Premium to 7 Professional) required the \"custom\" install approach, requiring a full reinstall install of your applications and data which won't make the trip from Vista to 7 (in truth it's only the installed applications that are sure goners; if had a senior moment and really forgot to backup valuable data, it may still be available in a folder named \"windows.old\" after the upgrade --but don't count on it; do your backups beforehand). I would have selected this choice even if the direct upgrade had been available; direct upgrades of Windows, with the seeming benefit of preserving your current applications and data are notorious for being buggy afterward.\n\nI also went online to check for Windows 7-specific drivers for a scanner and two printers (a monochrome laser and an color inkjet) that are hooked to this machine. Two of these devices already had Windows 7 drivers available; the web site of the other promised \"November\" availability (and the Vista drivers worked perfectly well for the one still waiting for its Windows 7 update).\n\nOnce my data was backed up, the new drivers saved and I had collected the applications I would need to reinstall (some were on CD, some were downloaded executables) I started the journey from Vista to Windows 7.\n\nTimeline (from loading the install DVD):\n-5 minutes: notification that \"upgrade\" option (retaining files and applications) was not available and that the \"custom\" option was required.\n-18 minutes: blue screen of death following long Vista shutdown sequence; not sure if this was normal or not.\n-20 minutes: \"starting Windows\".\n-29 minutes: installation \"completed\"; first automatic restart.\n-32 minutes: installation \"completed\"; second automatic restart, and visual progress bar appears at bottom of screen.\n-75 minutes: installation *really* complete, and initial Windows setup options offered.\n\nWindows 7 immediately recognized my wireless mouse and keyboard; the printers and scanner drivers were installed the devices available within 45 minutes.\n\nAs a veteran of several earlier operating system upgrades, installs on new machines, or reloads on older machines, this was by far the easiest (to this point). No drastic solutions were needed that had occurred following other Windows OS upgrades due to disconnects between Microsoft and hardware vendors (including a very scary BIOS upgrade during an Windows ME to XP upgrade, and the required purchase of a new printer to replace one that simply wasn't supported by Vista).\n\nImmediate improvements:\n-The Start menu has been simplified (get this: selecting the Start | Shutdown sequence actually *SHUTS DOWN* the computer now, instead of launching a THIRD window (and you can speed this up further with readily available desktop gadgets that take you direct to shutdown)\n-The programs listing is far easier to manage and customize, and the taskbar navigation is greatly improved. The taskbar permits greater control over its contents (and even if it can't keep an application for loading there, you can control which ones you see!).\n-User access control is much less problematic than in Vista (the only warnings I've received is when trying to run executables).\n-Folder navigation is far more intuitive, and I no longer feel like I'm managing my operating system at the same time I'm managing my tasks.\n\nImmediately after installation, this Windows 7 machine shut down in 20 seconds. Start up now takes about 55 seconds from the BIOS/POST sequence to the first appearance of the OS splash screen, and the menu of users is available about 90 seconds after powering on. The user desktop is ready to work (mine is fairly cluttered, with a dozen or so shortcuts and six separate desktop gadgets) about 10 seconds after the user selection is made.\n\nBut it's not all sunny and mild with Windows 7:\nMicrosoft has presented us with far too many upgrade paths, and even a powerful machine will be constrained somewhat by the operating system if you try too much multitasking. Also, see below for a discussion of Adobe products and their compatibility with Windows 7.\n\n2-week update:\nMore flaws emerge:\n\nAfter three days, I developed shutdown hang. Went through Microsoft's chat support offering...but should have used the phone (as multiple restarts were required, adding additional time to re-establish chat with the same agent...and the technician surely should have suggested this). We spent about 90 minutes checking services via msconfig. I disagree with their suggestion to begin by assuming that all Microsoft services are not potential suspects for this, and that it's a non-MS service causing the hang. Bottom line after this is the problem has improved from being constant (when it first appeared) to intermittent.\n\nWhen I finally upgraded the video card driver (the primary reason for making the move), the shutdown problem became less intermittent...but still present.\n\nSince then, I've changed the power management setting from \"balanced\" to \"performance\" (not an issue with a desktop on AC power) and updated both the CPU chipset drivers and BIOS. These steps have collectively reduced --but has not eliminated-- shutdown issues. The chipset and BIOS tweaks are not things most users are going to want to mess around with (and the BIOS update always carries the risk of turning your motherboard into a paperweight should the power go out while its underway).\nOther issues:\n(1) sometimes the task manager won't launch\n(2) sometimes the task manger won't end frozen processes\n(3) sometimes it won't access data in an attached external hard drive (eSATA interface)...even though the drive itself is still recognized. This always clears up upon restart.\nPresumably these are known to MS and will be corrected in an update or the first service pack.\n(4) If you are running older versions of Adobe products (in my case, Acrobat 8, Photoshop Elements 6 and Premier Elements 4): you may have compatibility issues with these versions that Adobe does not \"officially\" support in Windows 7. While I place this issue firmly in Adobe's court, if you are using Adobe applications, do your homework. Adobe products are generally intrusive (in terms of both activation requirements and footprint within the tender areas of a PC operating system) and definitely not cheap. I think I've resolved this, but it wasn't free of trouble, cost or time to do so.\n\nPlease note that I experienced NONE of these things under Vista.\n\nFinally:\nIf you are buying a new laptop or desktop with Windows 7 already installed:\nyou'll probably be a happy camper until you run into your first case of \"we don't support Windows 7\" (yet...or at all) with your version/model of software/hardware.", "summary": "What Vista could have been; don't attempt upgrade without strong geek skills!", "unixReviewTime": 1256428800}

Now I go to install it on a machine I had to wipe. Surprise !!!. When I go to get the same old app to sync things up, it's no longer available. I can keep using it on the machines that it's still loaded on. The re-formatted machine is out of luck.\n\nIs there a gotcha with the \"sync\" approach? Sure there is. If you have 200 Gb of pictures on your cloud, you *do not* want to sync them all with that old laptop with the 160 Gb disk. It's not going to work... All of the people writing the sync stuff allow you to select what you do and do not want to sync to this or that machine. It takes a bit of thought, but it's not that hard.\n\nAny bets on how likely this makes me to sign up for the \"Unlimited Everything\" plan and use their silly new app to get things on and off their cloud storage?

About the only use case I can see is for backups. Do a disk image each hour / day / week / month, zip it up and encrypt it. Feed it up to the unlimited plan with their app. If you have a disaster and need to recover, download it and start from there. May not save you from the ransomware guys.

The computer has a Windows Vista 32bit based operating system on a rather slow SATA hard drive but it managed to repair itself after about four reboots.\n\nRecommended Hardware Configuration\nPlease be aware that running a virus scan on any hard drive will fully utilize its available bandwidth.  As such, this product is best used with computers that have more than one cpu core.  You should also consider running a file defragmentation before installing AVG Internet Security 2011 so that when the scan does take place, it will be able to complete in a timely manner.

There's a reason why it is priced at about 10 times its stablemate, \"Streets and Trips\".\n\nSecond - I'm in total awe of this software ;)\n\nWith that out of the way, here's the rest of my review.\n\n# Installation\n\nI simply went with all the bells and whistles, and installed it on a budget notebook (Vista 64 bit, AMD Turion TL-60, 4GB RAM, 250GB HDD). The software installed fine, and runs like a dream. In over a month of using it, I haven't experienced any serious issues.\n\n# User Interface\n\nA lot has been said about the \"kludgy\" interface. And, yes, the toolbar icons are ugly. However, when you're driving at night, and your spouse is trying to click icons in a moving vehicle, I'm sure the wisdom of fat icons will be more readily apparent, and you'll praise the programmers who gave you nice juicy targets to click on.\n\nThe user interface is largely pane-based. Each pane is independently closable and resizable, but not dockable. I found this fairly pleasant, and it never cramped my style.\n\nNavigation  around the map is fairly intuitive - click and drag to move the map; the mouse cursor on the edges turns into scroll arrows; and double clicking zooms in. Contextual menus on right clicking also give you the right level of control.\n\nThe one non intuitive aspect is that to create a region, you must actually right click and drag. Then to zoom in, you click inside that region. But it works.\n\n# Function\n\nThe main purpose of this software is to support \"location based applications\". In other words, this software works by allowing you to project the non-location portions of your data onto a map. To make this happen you need to begin with data that has location (street, city, county, state) attributes as well as non-location attributes (such as sales figures, inventory numbers, and demographic data such as age and income).\n\nYou then tell MapPoint what location attribute to use in generating the map, and what non-location attributes you wish to represent, and sit back and prepare to be amazed.\n\nWhen you consider that you can have this data sourced from a variety of data sources (natively from delimited text files, Access databases, Excel spreadsheets, and via Microsoft Data Link); and that you can program MapPoint applications using the .NET suite to access the MapPoint ActiveX control and its rich object model; and that you can integrate MapPoint with your PowerPoint presentations and Word documents, you have an amazing amount of power at your disposal.\n\nWhat is positively astounding is the level of visualization you can achieve with this software.\n\nYou can pick the type of \"data map\" you want to create (push pins, pie charts, shaded areas, bar charts, etc.);  how  you want to represent \"data ranges\" on your maps (unique values, quantiles, continuous ranges, etc.); as well as customizing the colors, pushpins, etc. that make up your finished visualization.\n\nYes, it can do routing and GPS - but that's just icing on the cake.\n\n# Why this rating?\n\nWhat excites me most about this software is that its one of those rare products that take about a couple of hours to figure out, and then take a lifetime to master.\n\nThe possibilities are truly endless.\n\nIf you have a need for location based visualization - you owe it to yourself to download a trial version of this software, and run the tutorials.

I tend to live on the trailing edge, so jumping into Snow Leopard from a world of Jaguar and Panther was a huge change. So far I've not had a major problem.\n\nSnow Leopard looks superficially similar to Leopard, but Apple made enough changes under the hood that it could theoretically be considered v11.0 rather than 10.6. The system uses 64-bit code heavily, although Apple deemed many low-end models unable to run a 64-bit kernel (it seems to have something to do with drivers) and therefore those models use a 32-bit kernel. Frankly, you won't notice the difference unless you're trying to install more that 4GB of memory in those models. The new Cocoa-based Finder is more flexible but still maintains the same basic appearance and functionality that Apple introduced in 10.3.\n\nA lot has changed though, particularly utility programs getting shuffled around, combined, or outright deleted -- pretty much all the AppleScript access has been rolled into Script Editor and Xcode for example. Quicktime Player has been updated with a borderless playback window, though Quicktime 7 is still available as an optional install. Annoyingly, Rosetta is an optional install as well, an obvious cause for frustration for people still running significant amounts of PowerPC code. The developer tools remain as strong a component as ever, which is good because you will want them if you ever want to install anything that isn't available on a CD or as a binary download (a lot of Unix software for example); however, Xcode can seem a cluttered, convoluted mess and you may wish to familiarize yourself with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/command-line-basics/dp/013937681X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">command line basics</a>&nbsp;for small things like Fink. (In addition, 64-bit app support is a *major* change in the system, and trying to convert older code bases may give you a massive headache.) X11 support hasn't changed significantly since Panther, although your main concern there would be dock clutter from the window server.\n\nAn important gotcha: printer drivers. A lot of older printers are not supported by their manufacturers under Snow Leopard, but this is less of a problem than you'd expect -- Apple added the Gutenprint driver package to support a tremendous quantity of printers that have been essentially abandoned by their manufacturers, and I find it to be vastly more stable and effective than the older drivers.\n\nAll that said, the worrying trend in operating system distros is that upgrading an in-place system can be an enormous hair-yanker, so back up your data and do a clean install.

Buttons and key functionality are even located in the same place on the screen and much of the terminology is the same. As a web professional, I use Photoshop every day and I know a lot of people who use Photoshop exclusively to paint with as well. It is one of the major tools for professional digital artists and game developers, so why would you consider Painter over Photoshop?\n\nWhereas Photoshop has evolved into an all-purpose tool for digital artists, photographers, graphic designers, and web developers, Painter is a more specialized tool aimed at serious digital painters who want to paint. The brush options are extensive and bewildering, designed to feel the way natural brushes and media feel. For example, you can control the wetness, viscosity and evaporation rate of certain brushes and inks and paints. Experimenting with traditional media in real life would cost you quite a bit of money. To get the most of out the product, you'll need a Wacom tablet. Using just the mouse, it is unable to detect pressure and brush orientation.\n\nThe 943-page manual is available as a PDF from Corel's website. Corel also maintains an extensive YouTube channel for tutorials and showcases as well as on its own site. Corel offers a fully-functional time-limited demo for you to try out to see if it's right for you.

Well, after trying this latest version, I'm happy to report that it appears they too have jumped on the recent bandwagon of lighter leaner anti-virus products.  This version is much better than the last version I tried (approx. 2004-2005).  The installation was a little time-consuming but otherwise simple and trouble-free. Afterward, there was an option to optimize scanned files to improve scanning time.  The optimization took fifteen minutes to complete.  I then selected how frequently I wanted the program to update. The most frequent option is every four hours, which I selected. This particular two-year license is for one computer only.\n\nThe interface is neatly minimalist.  It offers plenty of advanced options within it's sub-menus for power users to tweak, yet, the main menu remains simple and manageable for less-technical users.  There is a menu bar at the top and twelve icons in the main area for the anti-virus, anti-spyware, anti-spam, firewall, linkscanner, anti-rootkit, system tools, e-mail scanner, identity protection, license, web shield, and resident shield.  Double-clicking an icon brings up the respective feature. From the menu bar on the left, the feature can then be launched or tweaked. The features and additional options are also available from the drop down menu.\n\nOn-demand scanning performance was pretty good. A full scan at default settings took exactly 15 minutes. I completed the initial optimization beforehand, which supposedly speeds up scanning, so I can only assume scans would be slower if optimization is skipped. You can also perform separate rootkit scans.  The firewall is pretty standard and did not interfere with any web processes, home network, or networked devices such as printers.  I do not use POP mail anymore (web access is the safest way to protect against spam and viruses), therefore, I can't tell you about the spam and POP protection.  I did try to test it with the native mail client in Windows Vista but I couldn't get it to work.  I tried checking AVG's system requirements on their web site, however, they only listed server-side programs (Exchange, Sendmail, SharePoint) in their application compatibility, but no desktop clients.  Weird...  I'm still trying to figure out exactly how the identity protection feature works.  There is no option to enter protected data.  It seems more like an additional layer of active malware and phishing monitoring than protection of specific sensitive data.  There are no parental control features offered.\n\nLinkscanner, which was recently acquired by AVG, works pretty well with IE or Firefox.  It's similar to Siteadvisor, except Linkscanner actually scans links in real-time instead of relying on a database.  There is an option to install the AVG browser toolbar, which includes Yahoo as the default search provider.  You can change it, but don't look for Google or Bing.  Your choices are Baidu, WebHledani, or Yandex (if you're scratching your head and asking \"Who?!?!\", trust me, you're not alone).  Thankfully, you can still use the default search box.  Browsing was not slowed or otherwise noticeably negatively impacted.\n\nSpeaking of system resource impact, it seems pretty minimal.  I installed it on a PC containing a 3.0 Ghz P4 with 1 GB of RAM and running Windows Vista Professional.  I have not observed any noticeable lag during normal operations, start-up, or shutdown. So far, AVG seems pretty stable and effective.\n\nThe only features I found lacking were identity controls and the absence of any parental controls.  I think in this day and age, children are particularly vulnerable.  The fact that this \"Internet Security\" suite provides no parental control whatsoever is a glaring omission.  Linkscanner might help prevent the kiddies from inadvertently picking up a drive-by download, but it won't keep them off inappropriate sites or seedy chat rooms, where trouble usually lurks.  Also, I wish the identity control was more configurable.  I'd like the peace of mind that specific sensitive information is actively filtered and blocked from being released without my consent.  These two complaints aside, AVG offers plenty of  useful features in a stable easy to use package.", "summary": "Great Protection. If only it had parental controls", "unixReviewTime": 1259798400}

I have installed and used Windows from version 2.4 (yes, there was such a thing) through 3.0,3.1,95,98,ME,NT,2000,XP, and Vista.  I've also built several desktops and would be considered proficient with computers.  I also run Windows 7 64 bit on my new laptop (it came preloaded) and loved it so much that I decided to buy the upgrade for my older desktop.  That's where the story takes a sad turn.  In short, this review is about my experience with the UPGRADE version that I paid for and not Windows 7 it self.  If you can install it, it's pretty great.\n\nI got this because I wanted to take advantage of the 64 bit capabilities of Windows 7.  The computer in question is older, but still more than capable - Dual Core 6400 with intel DG-965RY motherboard, 6 gigs of ram, 2 320 gig hard drives and a Nvidia 7900 GS card.  Originally it was running XP 32 and later upgraded to Vista ultimate 32.\n\nThe first problem I ran into was that because this is the upgrade version, it requires a valid previous installation of vista or XP.  What I usually like to do is wipe everything off my old drive before installing the new OS but this requirement prevented me to do so.  I don't see the point of checking the OS.  Yes, I know this is the upgrade but it could just as easily ask me to put in the VISTA or XP dvd to check to see if I have it.\n\nNext, the installation was painfully slow.  I started the installation in the afternoon and by the next morning it was only at 74% done.  later in that afternoon (after around 20 hours) it booted up for the last time and indicated Windows 7 was about to start.  I thoguht the nightmare was over but it was just starting.  After asking me to choose a name and password (very sluggishly) I was asked to type in the product key which i did.  Then the system froze and appeared to be doing something.  so again i went to bed and woke up the next day only to see my computer had gone into standby mode.\n\nFor the next 7 hours I waited for it to finish installing (turning the mouse to make sure it wouldn't go into standby mode again) but it never did.  I restarted the computer and went through the last step again but again it froze.  This time I decided to install XP again (which installed in about 25 minutes) and wipe everything off the hard drive, disable my USB ports, etc. and went through that again.\n\nLong story short, after 5 days, the upgrade freezes right after I put in my product key.  I have not tried the 32 bit version yet but the whole point of getting this was to use the 64 bit and extra RAM.  It's very obvious Microsoft did not test this enough for upgrades.  Even by their own admission, their own people took around 20 hours for upgrades so that should have been a red flag.\n\nSo my recommendation is don't bother upgrading if you already have a system that's working.  Either put it in a brand new system that's windows 7 certified or buy a computer with it built in.  I'm out a $100 but you shouldn't have to be.\n\n*update*\nI called MS tech support and was surprised at how eager they were to help.  I got several call backs to check on the status of the install, but unfortunately my machine just isn't made for windows 7 despite intel having windows 7 drivers for it.  I added another star for tech support's efforts.\n\n*final update*\nOverall I should take some of the blame too because when I ran the upgrade advisor, it told me that I was good to go (minus my linksys USB adapter) for the 32 bit version and I falsely assumed that it would be true for the 64 bit version as well.  Before installing, I tried to run the 64 bit upgrade advisor off the DVD but the actual program wouldn't run on a 32 bit platform which I found kind of odd.  For me the whole point of the upgrade was to go 64 bit and take advantage of my CPU and access to extra RAM so I am back on Vista (which runs great btw).  So take my review with a grain of salt.", "summary": "After 20 hours, the installation freezes after typing in product key", "unixReviewTime": 1275177600}

When finally 10.5.2 arrived I began using it. It fixes many Leopard bugs. According to some websites, at least 130 bugs have been fixed. This is important since many problems with third party software may be related to other software or to the operating system. For example, Apple is aware of problems with its Sync services and Core Image. Also, some bugs have existed for many years and have not been fixed, such as a potential bug when moving data to an external device.\nKeeping these issues in mind I did a completely clean install of Leopard 10.5.2 in a brand new hard drive.\nI installed Office 2008 as well as the available upgrade to 12.0.1.\n\nFirst Impressions:\nSome useful features have been added, such as Elements Gallery, which may be a time saver for many people. Some features have been removed, such as VBA, and this may be a deal-breaker for many people.\nI'm keeping Office 2004 in a separate partition in order to use previous versions of Word and Excel.\nAt the same time, I can still use the new versions when I don't need the VBA features.\nLack of VBA support was announced well over a year ago, so this came as no surprise.\n\nStarting up:\nEach program took approximately 10 seconds to launch. Office seems to have a peculiar way of handling fonts, though, and launch times can be greatly effected. After installing another program that installed more fonts, and installing Extensis Fusion to manage my fonts, launch times for Office programs was approximately 150 (one hundred and fifty) seconds, instead of the original 10 (ten) seconds.\nNow it takes about a minute to launch these programs. In all fairness, the slow down is partly caused by third party software.\n\nOverall (and very brief)  impressions:\nPowerPoint works with presentations that used to crash my 2004 version. The 2004 version was practically unusable for me. This was a welcome upgrade.\n\nExcel works fine and the Elements Gallery is a good addition. It lost VBA support and the Abalysys Toolpack. I kept the 2004 version as well.\n\nWord seems to be a solid upgrade. Some third party templates do not work with 2008, so I kept Word 2004.\n\nEntourage works very well. I had to re-select the folders that I had set up for my rules, and re-apply categories to my folders. Syncing with Address Book always adds many duplicate contacts. Fortunately there are scripts to deal with this inconvenience. Hyperlinks still require a workaround, as mentioned by another reviewer. I would not rate Office with 1-star solely based on that issue.\n\nExpression Media used to be called iView MediaPro, iView Multimedia, and iView many years ago. It used to be a $25 shareware program when I first used it. Eventually it became quite expensive so I never upgraded until I received this version. So far I'm happy with it. It has worked fine for cataloging thousands of fonts and pictures, and I'm entitled to a free upgrade when version 2 comes out.\n\nPrice:\nThere are free Office alternatives, as well as iWork. I( still prefer Microsoft Office for the most part. The only exception may be Keynote 4.\nMicrosoft offered a substantial discount under the names of The Technology Guarantee Program and the Super Suite Deal. Additionally, for one day they offered a $[...] rebate. So users could get the Mac Special Media Edition for approximately $[...]-$[...] with these offers.\nHad it not been for the offer, I would have stayed with Office 2004. I've used Office 2008 for a few days, every day, and so far have encountered no problems.\n\nOverall I'm satisfied with the upgrade. Support has been great, both by Microsoft and the MVP people. Search their forums and you'll find a lot of useful advise.", "summary": "Interesting update to Office 2004", "unixReviewTime": 1205798400}

I do wish it came with more pre-recorded music to add to my videos, and for me, that's it's only major drawback. Yes, I know you can burn any music you want, but it takes time so it would be great to have a wider choice of music already loaded in the system. I know other reviewers have complained about crashes and freezing, but so far I haven't experienced any of that. And hopefully, I never will.

Let me start with what I like:\n\n1. Good integration with online services. It is very easy to go from PaintShop to post the photos on photo sharing sites or to even get them printed. However, this is not a feature unique to PaintShop and even some free programs (Picasa) do it almost as well.\n2. Media organizer: For people like my grandparents who for some reason have a very difficult time organizing files and folders within Windows, I do think that the Media Organizer could be helpful. It is not quite as powerful as Adobe Bridge, but is very user friendly. Power users will be annoyed at its lack of features.\n3. Simple edits: To do basic edits, Corel is very simple. Cropping, red eye removal, and pre-made enhancements are easy to add.\n\nHOWEVER,\nas one reviewer has already commented, the fact that it overwrites original files is extremely dangerous, especially for the entry-level user at which this app is targeted. Yes it's cool to change the colors, crop, and add effects to photos. But these need to be saved as separate files so that the original untouched photo is still available. As far as I can tell, this isn't even an option. People like my grandparents won't even know what they're doing until they've changed all the pictures they've taken while playing around.\n\nAlso, all of the features that I like in Corel (see above) are done better in both Adobe Elements.

And there is a problem, the updates you can choose a path to download, but the main program just decides it wants C.  Main program is 7.30Gb.  Installation was wonky in a sense for me.  The update seems to download first, then you wait a while while you think it installs (to C:) then after everything is done, you are given the option to pick where you want to install it and it installs again?  In the end, the main program installed itself to C, gave me an install choice in which I chose D but it installed Pinnacle MyDVD there...so who knows what it needs to install.  After installation, you'll be greeted with a registration page upon startup of the program.  After startup, make sure to set your preferences.\n\nI imported a very wind shaken video clip and wanted to see how easily or how well Pinnacle could smooth it out.  I couldn't figure out how to add my own track and opted to use one included in the program.  I decided to export a 2560x1440 video to 4k to see how it goes.  I was using a stabilizer filter or effect, not sure what it's called.  But the filter displays as \"NewBlue Stabilizer: Analysis required\", we'll see if it goes away after rendering/exporting.  Well, the stamping remained and there was no audio (I forgot to unmute the soundtrack track).  I don't know.  Then the effects tab went away after I restarted Pinnacle, hoping that would clear things up.  Maybe the effects were located in some directory I changed.  I don't know.  Anyway, I tried again to see.  Second time worked with the audio track and no stamped filter thing, because I couldn't use it.  Surprisingly the 4k file is smaller than the original and still seems to retain the quality.\n\nFeatures I'll hopefully test out will be the live screen capture and later the stop motion animation.  Pinnacle Studio 20 Ultimate also features 360 video editing, something I want but not sure if I can make use of given what I have.  I also want to test its 3d editing powers but don't have anything for that yet either.\n\nFor now I'll give it a 4 star rating.  Not the easiest or intuitive to use but hopefully with more learning and usage this will improve.  If and when it improves I will come back and bump up the review to a 5.

The safe practice is to make sure you have some protection just in case. Consider McAfee LiveSafe 2015 your seatbelt. You get it not because you think you are going to get a virus but because you don't know and want to be safe in case something does happen.\n\nWhat you get when you buy the LiveSafe 2015 package at least in my case is a 5.5\" x 8.5\" cardboard envelope, inside is a product key that you use when you go to McAfees website. This allows you to download the software and install it directly. I think this is a brilliant idea. First it reduces the cost of manufacturing and ultimately in theory should reduce the cost of the product, but it also allows you to install the software on a system that does not have a cd-drive. In addition to installing on a windows or MAC PC, this can be installed on an Android smartphone as well.\n\nYou are getting a suite of tools, first off virus and malware protection along with phising/spam blocks. You get access to McAfee SafeKey which remembers your passwords. If you use LastPass this is not needed, but it is nice they throw this in as an extra. You get 1gb of cloud storage that uses voice and face authentication. And you get free technical support for the life of the product.\n\nThe virus protection itself performs very good, it doesn't seem to slow down my PC much at all, and in the android world it works as you would expect. It really is good insurance, the virus protection part.\n\nI will say that the two extras they include I'm not that thrilled about. Password and document management is nice, but like I said I use LastPass and already have the functionality for $12 a year for password management that works across all my devices. But then I also have a google account, and if you are using this on android you do too. With Google you get Drive which allows you to have a lot more than 1 gb of storage for free. The benefit of McAfee is it does do voice and face authentication, but personally I use two factor authentication through google so I feel safe.\n\nDon't buy this for the password management and document storage, buy it for the anti-virus protection. It's nice that this allows you to install it on all of your devices, you are not limited to one or two. In fact it doesn't say what the limit it, just \"subject to limitation on reasonable use and purpose of the product.\" whatever that means. For most of us, a couple laptops and a few phones in the family and you are set.\n\nOverall I really do like this, it works well. Yes there are free options available, but most have a premium upgrade and if you think about it, 3 phones and 2 laptops and it's $10 a piece since the this is selling for $50. It's a good value for the money from a company that has a history of quality virus protection, and there is finally a product from them that doesn't have a major impact on the performance of your PC.", "summary": "On a mac it is still debatable and on the smart phone it depends on the OS you run and ...", "unixReviewTime": 1421193600}

I've tried to dictate stories in Word 2010, write e-mails, reply on message boards, respond on instant messengers and eve toyed around with navigating in Windows. Of those attempts, using Word has been the most successful but still not a great experience. It could be because the bulk of my writing is of the creative kind. I did use a gaming headset that's pretty good and noise reduction.\n\nThere are a lot of good points though. For one, I can have the TV going, voice chat on my notebook and still be able to use Dragon with my desktop headset with almost no problems because of the excessive noise. That's pretty cool actually. Dragon did pretty well with some unusual character names in some of my stories, and seemed to learn the other names after several frustrating attempts. Working in Word, there were a lot of better options for corrections, undoing lines and punctuation.\n\nThe not so good, I couldn't get Dragon to easily utilize smart quotes. I looked online, and it looks like there are a few creative ways around this problem, but really if my Word doc is set-up to use smart quotes, I just don't understand why it's such a struggle for Dragon to use them. They even updated Dragon with 11.5 that allows you to \"quote\" that, which a really, really nice feature for quoting and dealing with conversations.\n\nWorking on a message board wasn't as fun. Dragon seemed to have some trouble with undo, delete and other corrections in comparison to how well those features worked in Word. It was nice on one hand because basic message boards don't really offer an undo, for example, so the fact you can do an undo can be seen as a boon. The problem is, it doesn't seem start and end in appropriate segments like word did. Starting a new paragraph, deleting, doing another sentence and then another and saying undo seemed to wipe out everything.\n\nReally Dragon is a fascinating tool. I know a version of it is going to be used in clinical areas where I work, but I personally found the experience more frustrating than anything else. On the other hand, I am a pretty quick typist, so it wasn't really for speed reasons I would want to use this so much as an easier way to get my thoughts down.\n\nI think some people are going to love this product, and I would encourage anyone with patience and experience with this type of software to give it a go.

My iMac is a 21.5, mid 2011, 2.5 GHz Intel Core i5 (quad core), 12 GB 1333 MHz DDR3, AMD Radeon HD 6750M 512 MB graphics card, running OS X 10.8.2.  (This is not the latest and greatest iMac out there, but is more than powerful enough to exceed Nuance's specs for this product.  Moreover, this machine is far more powered than my comparison machine, my work PC which is an HP Compaq 8000 Elite, with a paltry 3 GHz, Core 2 Duo processor and only 4 GB of memory, running Windows XP and Dragon Naturally Speaking 11.5.)\n\nTHE QUICK OVERVIEW:\nWhen it comes to voice dictation software, the Dragon has taken over.\n\nThere might have been some early rivals a while back that were jockeying for position and there are definitely rivals out there for the commercial market... and, who knows, giants like Apple and Google have pretty amazing voice recognition software in their own right; but, at this point in time, the only realistic choice in dictation software for the home consumer these days is Nuance's Dragon Naturally Speaking. That said, Dragon Dictate is their Mac version.\n\nOn the whole, this is capable software, on par with Nuance's product for the PC.  But do realize that the Mac version is only 3.0 and Nuance is already on Dragon 12.0 for the PC.  The products work similarly, but the PC product is definitely more mature.  Secondly, Nuance hasn't exactly figured out how to tap into the 'Macness' of OS X.  The software definitely works after a fashion, but sometimes behaves like a rude tourist, not always integrating well with OSX's feature set and is often a major resource hog.\n\nWhat your get in the end is reasonable voice dictation/recognition software that definitely does the job, but is still a little rough around the edges.\n\n***AN IMPORTANT ASIDE: Nuance released this product a bit too early.  Prior to the latest software patch, it crashed often or would cause my Mac to hang such that I would have to force quit the program frequently.  This probably explains some of the more negative reviews on this site.  After the last software patch (and an upgrade of RAM), it now functions respectably on my machine.  That said, I would make sure that your Mac exceeds the suggested specs before you run out and buy this program.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX:\nThe product comes with a CD, quick start guide, and a USB headset.  As equipment goes, the headset is meant for basic dictation.  The sound from the single earpiece is not audiophile quality (nor would you be expecting this).  The mic has more than good enough sound for voice dictation. It is reasonably constructed from plastic.  It is not the most comfortable headset I've ever used but was more than serviceable for dictation purposes.\n\nSET UP:\nThe installation was intuitive and nearly automatic, but for whatever reason took quite some time.  After installation, you have to set up your profile for voice recognition/dictation.  Each user needs a different profile, as the software needs to adapt itself to the quality of your voice.  This consists of setting up the audio source.  For reasons that are unclear to me, the default source--even with the headset plugged in--was the 'Dragon Remote Microphone.'  This would be good for, say, using your iPhone to dictate into the system, but will not work with the headset.  This needs to be changed with a simple toggle.  You choose spelling (American or British). You can then choose from a variety of accents from American (standard/inland Northern/Southern/teen),British, Indian, Latino, and Southeast Asian.  You then wait a while again for Dragon to set up the profile and load the spelling and grammar files.  After a quick microphone check.  You then proceed to voice training, where you can choose from a variety of passages from easy to 'medium' reading so that Dragon can get used to your voice.  It performs various calibrations and then sets up the profile.  You can then opt for Dragon to scan your old documents for unique vocabulary (a time consuming process that can be done later.)\n\nWhen all is said and done, from set up to training, you should be up and running with Dragon within 45 minutes to an hour (so long as you save the document scan for later).  This may seem like a long time, but when you compare this to older versions of Dragon, it is actually pretty speedy.\n\nTHE EXPERIENCE:\nDictating  with the Dragon software is definitely something that  has a learning curve. You have to get used to the quirks of the program. However, even with these quirks,  I believe you'll find that Dragon can still outpace even the fastest of typists. You will need to learn how to speak clearly so that the program can understand you, remember to speak with punctuation so that it is added within the text, and you need to learn how to correct text without using the keyboard, so you can gain maximum speed. Generally,  The program does a bang up job when it comes to standard dictation and voice recognition.\n\nSIMPLE DICTATION:\nThe experience is somewhat software dependent. If you're looking at straight dictation, the best program to work with seems to be Microsoft Word.  This is probably the  word processor most used in businesses and integrating with Microsoft Word is likely the highest priority for Nuance. Microsoft Word even has it's own set of integrated commands.\n\nThe same cannot be said of other word processors, such as OpenOffice and Apple's Pages, where the spacing is sometimes quirky and where capitalizations don't always occur automatically at the beginning of a paragraph and may even occur mid sentence.\n\nEven with these issues,  I can still dictate by voice much faster than I can type, but this does add to the proofreading.  These kinds of problems are compounded in less conventional programs, such as Writer, where corrections can sometimes lead to dropped characters and can throw off the formatting.\n\nOnce you get used to use the system, Dragon definitely delivers on dictation. It is easy to use and set up and the dictation is fast and accurate.\n\n(Note:  As you can imagine, the English language has many words that sound like or need to be spelled differently in different contexts.  No voice dictation system, even a smart dictation system, will be perfectly accurate at this point. After dictating, it is always necessary to edit carefully.)\n\nCOMMANDS:\nI do use Dragon to launch  and close programs occasionally. However, I'm not a power user when it comes to hands-free use of the Mac. I'm sure if someone put their mind to it, they could get Dragon to do pretty much anything they wanted it to do. However, one major criticism is that Dragon does not integrate with OS X in the same way that it integrates with garden varieties of Windows. I can launch Pages, for example, by saying,\"launch Pages.\"  But even in command mode, pages doesn't always close when I say, \"close  Pages.\" Moreover, when I open Pages, I am able to select an old document, but it isn't very clear  how to get Dragon to open a new document. I gave up just hit the document button.\n\nIn Windows, all this runs more smoothly and more intuitively.  Dragon seems more at home in the Windows world.  However, it is quite possible that over time I will become more facile at getting Dragon to cooperate with OS X, however this was not necessary in the Windows version.\n\nTHE INTERFACE:\nI am a big fan of Apple's upper taskbar. It definitely keeps things simple and keeps all controls for all programs in one place.  I realize that Apple doesn't like clunky command bars, but even clunky command bars can serve a purpose.\n\nDragon's interface for OS X is a floating rectangle. There is a button to toggle the microphone off and on, change voice recognition modes, toggle dictation, and toggle spelling. It is perhaps a minimalist and elegant interface befitting  OS X. However, it is far less practical than the long, albeit somewhat unsightly, toolbar that is available for Windows users. Instead of simply  clicking on the thing I need to control Dragon, I have to toggle Dragon so that commands appear in the upper taskbar and then I need to find what I'm looking for one of the embedded menus. This may not seem like a lot, but having to use two to three clicks instead of one is no bargain in my book.  In the greater scheme of things, it may not add a lot of time, but it does add to the frustration of using this program. Unfortunately, on the Apple version, there is not even an option for Dragon toolbar.\n\nCRASHES/HANGS:\nAfter the most recent update, I've had many fewer crashes. However, Dragon still occasionally freezes and has to be forced to quit. This happens more often when I'm running other programs. As noted above, my iMac is no slouch, with a quad core, i5 Intel processor with 12 GB of RAM.  There should be more than enough processing power to go around and with enough RAM to satisfy the most memory thirsty programs out there.  Nevertheless, I still get multicolored beach ball at times. This was far  more common when I tried to run Dragon with only 4 GB of RAM. But even after the RAM upgrade crashes and hangs  were still pronounced until Dragon updated their software.\n\nNow I get occasional hangs, but  crashes are few and far between. When I first received the software  frequent hangs and crashes made the software nearly unusable. This was shocking to me  as Dragon worked far better on my older, dual core PC with 4 GB of RAM and the geriatric windows XP operating system. Happily, the combination of beefing up my RAM and the Dragon software patch seem to have cleared  up the bulk of the problems.  (One advantage of the Mac version is that I only have to force quit and restart Dragon when there are problems.  On the Windows version I usually have to reboot the system to clear up resource sharing errors, C+ runtime errors, and file sharing problems.)\n\nThat said, Dragon has a habit of not playing well with the other children. On my PC, Dragon also has tendency to crash, if I don't keep XP happy by shutting down and restarting at least once every two weeks. This is likely due to some kind of resource sharing conflict--possibly with Word itself--after Windows has been running continuously without a cleansing reboot. There are times, in Windows, where it won't allow me to save or open a user profile because another program is using the files (What other program uses these files?!?) The program can be temperamentally glitchy, but this is the nature of the beast at this point.  The fact that using Dragon (on Windows or the Mac) saves me incredible amounts of time doesn't justify the awful software issues, but it does mean that it is still incredibly useful and that I will continue to use this product.\n\nCUSTOMER SUPPORT:\nNuance is notoriously flimsy when it comes to personal, customer support. I did not contact customer support for this product, but in the past they offered a support ticket system free of charge for only 90 days. (This is far better than their old system, which--not unlike getting arrested--allowed for only one, unpaid phone call for support.)  Unless it is pathetically simple, phone queries basically generated an online ticket-type response system.  Not bad, but not all that personal and sometimes it is hard to solve such things on a glorified email system. (My guess is that they reserve the excellent phone support for their corporate customers.)\n\nAfter 90 days you are basically out of luck unless you want to spend just less than 10 dollars for an online query or 19 dollars+ to speak to a technician on the phone. They do, however, have a large database of answered questions on their site and they also have a very active forum where some generous superusers can get you out of a whole heap of trouble. (I contrast this with other companies where a technician actually will spend some time on the phone and they don't drop you like a hot potato after 90 days.)\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nAll in all, if you are looking for voice dictation software Dragon offers a reasonable solution for the home or business user. Dragon is still the best--and really only viable--option for home voice dictation that is available; that's why I gave it 4 stars. When it comes to crashes, voice control, and seamless integration with the Mac, however, Nuance still has a ways to go and definitely should have turned out a more polished product. Still, after the last software patch this is definitely an eminently usable product.  Finally, even though Nuance's Dragon still needs a little taming in either the Mac or PC world, it is still a major time saver and, at this time, is really the only available software for voice dictation that is available for the home user.\n\nRecommended with reservations.", "summary": "Definitely not perfect, but still the best dictation software out there for the Mac", "unixReviewTime": 1361145600}

My youngest daughter was in a ballet recital but a few days before the recital she fell and cut open her head.

Until upgrading to the 2010 version I'd been running Quicken 2007. Upgrading from 07 to 10 was easy and only took a few minutes to convert my data file. All my memorized updates work, so from an ease of upgrade standpoint, they did a great job (at least under my particular circumstances).\n\nStylistically they made a few changes to colors and fonts, which I personally think are an improvement, but that's preference more than anything. The nuts and bolts of the program have changed very little. They do let you modify your tabs which is something I've been looking for since 2002. You can now choose which tabs you want on your main start screen which is nice.\n\nThe program is also more stable. My old 2007 version would semi-frequently lock up during bank-info downloads. This one hasn't locked up once, and is a lot more stable on my Vista 64-bit system. I hope it retains that stability when I upgrade to Windows 7 in a week. (I'll update my review once I am on W7).\n\nThe bottom line is does this upgrade offer something substantial enough to warrant spending the money to buy it? I don't believe so. Aesthetic improvements aside, upgrading to a more stable version, while nice, would not be necessary if the program had been programmed correctly the first time around. I do like that it crashes less, but that's really an issue with the 2007 version being buggy and could have been fixed with a patch instead of a complete program replacement. I'm not a big fan of paying for new versions of programs that do basically the same things as the older version without any compelling improvements.\n\nThat said, this program does what it's supposed to do, and does it pretty well overall. Do you need to upgrade? Probably not. You're not gaining any remarkable new features with this version, so if your older version is stable and does what you need it to do, save your cash.\n\n*****UPDATE 01-13-2010*****\n\nI've been using QB2010 on 64-bit Windows 7 for months without a hiccup. Intuit really improved their platform stability with this release. It's not crashed a single time vs. crashing regularly with QB2007.

I would not suggest that you rely upon this extensive library of contracts and forms if you have absolutely no knowledge of the law, or no experience with legal issues. That being said it is a first-class tool to use at state and federal level. The program itself is extraordinarily easy to install. The user agreement in the installation process is mildly amusing since it disavows any liability and\nrecommends that you should consult a lawyer, and the extent of any liability for the company that puts out the legal business Pro software is just for the cost of the program. That piece of mild amusement (at least for anyone who has done contract law at university level) aside, the program provides updates as you start and continues, if you register, to provide additional updates for two years after 31st of December 2014; one of the bonuses of registration is a 404 page contract law book.\n  Once you start the program you have a whole list of resources including a library of legal books and even references to lawyers by category. When you start to create a document the program has a basic three-part interface: the first is create document. The second is read Nolo book from library. And the third is view checklist. A sizable amount of the forms that you can use are basically fill in the spaces type of documents, and for small businesses these will undoubtedly come in handy; about the only recommendation I would make is that wherever possible make sure that you have very good records, since (for example) a request for a bounced check to be honored, could quickly get to a small claims issue, and how something as simple as that is handled varies from state to state. The second reference to the library is probably going to be good for research for contracts, and finding cases with precedents where certain clauses are deemed enforceable, and certain closely worded ones are deemed not enforceable can usually be found in either case law or precedent books. In the more basic sense, the checklist in legal business Pro can help you through some easy things to sort out, as well as some moderately complex things to sort out. As good as this set of forms, contracts, and other references are in the legal realm, the biggest issue you will face, in my opinion, is the decision concerning when your own ability to handle issues is stretched to its limits, and it's time to call a lawyer. Still, it may be a big learning experience if you draft up a contract, whether agreement, lease, business related contract, and take it to a lawyer and see how far off the mark you might be. If you are halfway decent at researching you might actually find that you can draw up a contract that actually stands up to the test, and legal business Pro 2014 is definitely the set of tools to get you at least part of the way there.", "summary": "Excellent guide and reference for legal tools", "unixReviewTime": 1390348800}

For me, however, the annual upgrade on Norton Products always ends up free--at least it has since the turn of the millenium. Inevitably if you wait long enough their rebates come out that make the upgrade to the new product absolutely cost free. This holds true even with their full suite which may retail at $70, but I've managed to get 5 copies for various computers I manage at a final cost to me of $0. Actually, with Amazon.com because I get a discount because of the A9 search engine, I think I've managed to earn a couple of bucks by installing Norton Internet Security. Next year, I'll use the rebates to do the same.\n\nWith Internet Security, the concerns of many people who are against Norton and Symantec (especially firewall) with the exception of the resource hog issue (Symantec really needs to address this issue) are handled.\n\nSymantec needs to fix their technical service side of things by offering free help of at least some sort. They need to tone down the issues of resource hogging. But as lon as they offer me free upgrades every year and consistently maintain virus-free computers (6 years virus free on all on the computers I've managed: usually 5-7 at one time) I'll stick with Symantec.

I bought a pack of 3-year licenses which led me through upgrades to 2.0 and recently to 3.0. My overall experience with Kaspersky has been favorable; that said, it has presented some challenges along the way. My experience probably would be different had I installed fresh every time, rather than upgrade.\n\nWhen Pure 3.0 was released I received an upgrade notice and I immediately downloaded the new version. Then, I kicked off the install without reading the instructions which ended up being a very bad mistake. The instructions state that other security suites, including previous versions of Pure, must be uninstalled first, a step I skipped. So, about 75% into the install the installer quit due to open files, leaving the install in an incomplete state. Worse, it corrupted the older version to a point that it could not be uninstalled, nor could 3.0 ever finish proper installation. The result was a system with a completely broken security install that could not be repaired. I am going to reimage that system shortly.\n\nOn a different system, I followed the install directions completely and the install was as smooth as could be. The lesson learned from this was to follow the directions, even if common sense says that it should uninstall older versions of itself. I could understand if it clashed with a competing product, but it should at least be smart enough to handle older versions of itself in such a way that the system is not left in a broken state.\n\nOnce Pure was properly installed, I have seen no issues. Other reviewers have stated that the product has a bad tendency to turn itself off, but I have not seen this with version 3.0 (though it was definitely an issue with 2.0). I am running Pure 3.0 on a Windows 7 64-bit system. There are enough others complaining of this issue to make it a concern and I have been watching for it but so far the product has remained stable and has not failed me. It's definitely something to keep in mind, though.\n\nPure 3.0 looks very much like version 2.0 and has pretty much the same feature set with a few additions. The application's main interface is a dashboard-style window with access to key features of the suite - backup, computer protection and parental control.\n\nI have not used the backup functionality so I really cannot adequately talk to this feature, though I am glad to know it's there and may use it down the road. It allows for backing up important personal files such as movies, pictures and documents as well as defining a custom backup filter too. This is not a complete backup solution and is meant to be a way to back up critical data.\n\nThe computer protection section of the application provides access to the meat of Pure, including the scanning functions, firewall, anti-spam, anti-banner and more. All of these work together to provide a cleaner and safer computing experience. The two most critical functions, the scanner and the firewall, provide solid protection and so far have never let me down. I especially like the firewall which has passed every test I have been able to throw at it - port scans, file system access attempts and more.\n\nThe parental controls module is an important feature to me and so far I have been satisfied. I like that it allows for blocking out times when the network is accessible and it allows for category blocking which makes blocking whole classes of websites very easy. It errs on the side of caution and sometimes prevents access to websites that I regard as acceptable, and I would rather have that issue than have it allow access to objectional content online.\n\nWith the exception of the really bad installation issues I saw (which one could argue were my fault for not following directions), my experience with Pure 3.0 has been positive. It has been very stable and it has protected my system nicely. Going on my experience alone I would not hesitate to recommend Pure. Still, there are a number of others who have seen issues with the application turning itself off, enough so that it merits some consideration.", "summary": "Decent Protection, Bad Install Experience", "unixReviewTime": 1369785600}

It's as if we were led to believe for years that even a modicum of stability and interoperability were too much to ask for.  And we were.  The government needs no better proof of why a monopoly is bad for consumers than to add up all the crashes, incompatibilities, and lousy performance results that Windows has chocked up over the past twenty years.  Pathetic.  Those in the know will tell you that Windows has kept a cottage industry of computer technicians and troubleshooters gainfully (and lucratively) employed; to them, it has been the goose that laid the golden egg.  A big, fat egg.\nNow we have XP.  It's only been out a short time, but it seems to be far more stable than its predecessors.  It's about time.  It still crashes from time to time and gets buggy when you try to \"plug and play\" various peripherals, but those problems haven't led to system meltdown yet.  Thankfully.  But we should have had an operating system like this from Microsoft years and years ago.  There is nothing technologically innovative or superior about Windows XP.  It simply works pretty well and most people should be happier with their computers than they've ever been.  (Windows 2000 is essentially Windows XP; I've heard the same kinds of comments about it:  It does what it is expected to do most of the time without bringing your system down.  Fingers crossed, it seems to actually be an operating system that isn't an Edsel.)\nBut there are operating systems out there that are well-ahead of Windows XP.  Mac OS X is such an operating system.  Much easier to use.  Much more stable.  Much more elegant.  Yet, because of the entrenched Windows monopoly, few give it a chance.  But, today, there is no reason to stick with Windows.  The new Mac OS is completely compatible with any Windows network (Mac OS X is based on UNIX, which is the most time-tested stable operating system ever, and also the basis for the industrial LINUX operating system), has all the popular programs that work on Windows (including a marvelous new Office for Mac X that bests the Windows version of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Entourage).  It also has the best multimedia programs in the business--none of which are available for Windows.  Burn CDs and DVDs, use the best mp3 player out there (the iPod), handle digital cameras and photographs effortless, make your own home movies without even cracking an owner's manual.  And, Apple has the best buy in a home computer system:  the new iMac G4.\nFight the power.  Try something else.  Linux.  Mac OS X.

The program can utilize both photo and video media files to create your own movie.\n\nWhen you're ready to publish, you have a choice of formats to choose from. The program also has quick settings for different device and different online services. I can upload directly to YouTube, Facebook, Vimeo, Daily Motion, and others. The process went quite fast for me. Once I created my 3 minute short video in an HD format, it was rendered in a short time. The uploading to Facebook actually took longer than rendering, but it did upload properly and was available quickly.\n\nWhat got me annoyed so far, when I use the Wizard help, some of the photos were cropped too tight. Even with the special effects zooming out or similar, the majority of the photos in my video were cropped much closer than needed to. Lots of good parts of my photos ended up getting cropped out. Other than than, it still managed to make a great video out of my photographs.\n\nOnce you start poking around in PowerDirector, you'll find new, cool, different, techie features that get your imagination going.

This edition of the 2016 Office suite has Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Outlook, and OneNote, but it doesn't have Publisher and Access; you have to subscribe to Office365 to get these.

I get all the anti-piracy, EULA stuff, but each day makes me feel more like a drone of Microsoft or Apple, or whomever/whatever. I'm no longer an independent operator; I'm some corporation's node....\n\nOkay, enough editorializing. Back to the item at hand. Installation was relatively straight-forward; log in (or sign up) at the Microsoft site, enter the Product Key, sort through several options, and watch the installation begin. No problem whatsoever. The apps were ready to be used about 10 minutes in, but full installation took about 30 minutes.

Personally I'd buy Office 2010 or Office 2013. I also recommend the Open Source (that is, free) LibreOffice suite and even Corel's WordPerfect suite. And from a costs-features perspective you might find Office365 a better deal.

The reason I've given it 4 stars instead of 5 (the first time I've done that with this series) is because there are several places where what you have to do to move on is illogical, and for these same areas, there isn't any hints to let you know what to do.  As a result, I wound up having to consult \"UHS Hints\" (a really good website where you can find hints to all the Nancy Drew games) a lot more than I would have liked...\n\n\"Shadow Ranch\" is situated in the Arizona Desert - and the graphics of this area are great!  The mystery surrounds strange happenings that are occuring on the ranch - such as a phantom horse riding through at night, always accompanied by a major mishap at the ranch (a snake bite, power lines become downed, pump house floods).\n\nNancy finds out early in the game that there are rumors about an old bank robber who had hidden a treasure for his sweetheart - who used to live at the ranch.  So your job, as Nancy Drew, teen detective, is to 1. find out who or what is behind all of the strange mishaps - are they linked to the phantom horse, or does it just appear that way?  And 2. find the treasure - if there is one...\n\nIn order to get around the desert, you get to ride a horse - be sure to look around at everything you can find about riding horses before you begin, or you just might find yourself falling off a lot!!!\n\nOverall, I found this game to be fun to play, although it did become quite frustrating at times...  If you find yourself having difficulty as I did, I'd recommend going to the \"UHS hints\" website - they allow you to choose how many hints to take, and you can always get a few before you're given the full answer - this way, if you just need a push in the right direction, you don't have to see the full answer and ruin the fun of figuring out for yourself.", "summary": "Another Good Game!", "unixReviewTime": 1134864000}

But let's get right to the point: there are better products on the market today worth considering. And with such products as the latest AVG Anti-Virus Free Edition, to name one, it's hard to recommend this one from Bitdefender, unless you're new to computing and just want an easy-to-install product.\n\nI initially installed this product on two computers, an HP Presario notebook running Windows Vista, and on a Sony VAIO running Windows XP Professional. Both computers had all available software updates and Service Packs installed. There were no problems with the installation on either computer other than a number of mildly annoying little pop-ups and reboots, but if you've installed security and anti-virus applications before, then you are probably familiar with this happening.\n\nGetting down to details...\n\nInstallation: For the most part, and other than the above noted minor annoyances, the setting up process was smooth, as should be expected with a contemporary package of this type.\n\nEase of Use: Bitdefender Internet Security 2010 was as good as any of the other \"major\" anti-virus and security packages on the market today. If you've been looking for an alternative to some of the other security products, then this operates as well as and in some cases even better than some of the higher prices packages.\n\nFunctionality/Protection: As one who has dealt with computer security and Internet protection for a number of years, this was the area that mean the most. In each case, the product handled any of the older viruses and isolated Trojan horses that I keep on CD for such testing. Also visited a number of older and newer familiar malware sites, and this Bitdefender application blocked each one.\n\nConclusion: Bitdefender offers a decent package for those who are looking for a reasonable computer security application at a fair price. The interface is good, as is the overall product, but there may be better choices worthy of consideration, such as the latest AVG Anti-Virus Free Edition (noted above), or&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Vipre-AntiVirus-AntiSpyware/dp/B0026PEP5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Vipre AntiVirus + AntiSpyware</a>, which which this reviewer found to be a superior product overall, and one that I reviewed here some months ago.\n\nIn any case, Bitdefender Internet Security 2010 is a reasonably good product and deserves a 4-star rating form this reviewer, but it's just not a stellar product. It would pay to look at all of the recent security offerings, both free and paid for before you make your final choice.", "summary": "Bitdefender Internet Security works, but...", "unixReviewTime": 1258588800}

After the update, the processor worked between 40 percent and 55 percent of the total capacity.

Prior to the latest update, I would dictate five to ten cells of data  then the application would either hang or place random numbers in the cells. After the last update, I was able to dictate one hundred cells of data with only a handful of errors. I did notice that the app was  sluggish when more than one workbook open at a time. The one issue that continues to appear deals with decimal points. Dragon 5.0 does not recognize the command to place a numeric decimal point well.\n\nTranscription mode: This mode works well when you use recordings from a source repeatedly. However, if you work with unique sources each time it tends to have a low success rate. The accuracy level with unique voices was about 65 percent, but that was also 65 percent of the original report I did not have to type.\n\nIn the end, many of the shortcomings with the Dragon 5.0 software have been addressed and the software turned out to be quite useful.", "summary": "Runs the Processor up to 100% and Uses All the RAM", "unixReviewTime": 1465689600}

I rememberd much preferring it to the early versions of Word and MS Works, but that's not saying a whole lot after so many years. Since that time I had become accustomed to Microsoft Office XP and then Office 2003, while more recently using Oracle's open-source [...] project (which is a great option for many home users). I have grown tired with Microsofts GUI updates in their last two versions of Office, so it's nice to see Corel go with an interface that's instantly recognizable to anyone who's used a word processor without any \"Huh? What's that button there for?\" moments. Word/Office may have been a more intuitive and user-friendly program at one time, but that ended with Office 2003.\n\nDocument compatibility is another area where WordPerfect Office X5 excels. Of course it has its own file format, but it also supports Microsoft's new OOXML formats, as well as [...]'s ODF formats. While that's not an absolute guarantee that it can open every file properly (especially when it comes to Word document formatting), that does make it one of the most compatible Office suits right out of the box, without having to download any kind of viewers or file converters (which Microsoft can't even do between its own lines of products). In fact, out of the box Office X5 supports over 60 different file types.\n\nWordPerfect X5 is what this suite is named after, but the other applications are also noteworthy, particularly Lightning, which acts as a document organizer and information manager. Quattro Pro X5 and Presentations X5 do pretty good impressions of Excel and PowerPoint, respectively, while Nuance Paperport 12 SE is there for document scanning, imaging and management (please note that this version of Nuance Paperport is not really the full version, some features are limited). If there's one weakpoint, it's the inclusion of Mozilla Thunderbird. While it's a great e-mail client (I use it at home), it's simply not good when compared to Outlook when in a Microsoft Exchange environment. Thanks to Microsoft's proprietary files, Thunderbird just doesn't seem to be a good match for Exchange, when it's even an option. Sure, there are ways to configure it to make it work, but it's hard to recommend it over Outlook in that case. If you run a small business and just need a simple e-mail client for POP3 and IMAP accounts, then it gets a hearty recommendation.\n\nAll-in-all, WordPerfect Office X5 is a recommended and much more user-friendly affair than recent offerings from Microsoft. Throw in the fact that it's a good bit less expensive and has a wide breadth when it comes to office suite compatibility (it can handle anything the MS Office and OpenOffice can throw at it), and it may be the best bet for your office.", "summary": "Powerful and user friendly!", "unixReviewTime": 1280448000}

So I have to compare how much of an improvement there has been compared to the years before that. New versions (actually new releases, using the industry parlance that was in place when Quicken for DOS first hit the market) are iterative, add some new features, but are largely the same as older versions with only one or two significantly new or improved features. If you put this in a historical context, that's actually a good thing. When Scott Cook first came up with Quicken, he didn't take the traditional approach. He advertised in airline magazines rather than computer magazines and advertised to \"regular people\" rather than computer people. Instead of selling for the inflation-adjusted price of $854, which was common for spreadsheets, databases and word processors of the day, he sold the software for well under $100, inflation adjusted. And he sold annual updates for a price low enough that it was literally cheaper than buying an aftermarket book on how to use the product. They weren't major changes, but they were affordable. So when you pay a mere $39.99 for the entire product, depending on the version, you are benefiting from a revolution that Scott Cook single-handedly put in place to change the entire software industry.\n\nIn that sense, you get a lot for your money. When I first started using Quicken, it was an easy way to keep my checkbook balanced, and allowed me to print checks directly from a dot matrix printer. Over time, support was added for credit cards, investments, real property, and even business functions depending on the version. The software lets you look at the big picture when it comes to your finances. It lets you link accounts in such a way that you can see what comes out of one account when it goes into another account, or what goes from your cash account to your investment account or from your checking account to pay your credit card bills. It lets you keep track of your receipts and keep images of your checks or invoices with the individual transactions. And it keeps track of your securities, monitors the prices, and shows you how well your investments perform. It does so a lot better than tools you might find at your brokerage since there are so many ways of reporting things.\n\nThe latest version has cloud support and support for an app for your phone. Yes, it's limited to spending accounts and you will still have to use an app from your broker to get an instant view of your investments. Then again, you would need to do so to execute trades anyway. But for spending, it's a lot easier to snap a photo of a receipt with a smartphone than to scan it or enter it later, so when it syncs with the desktop app, it's easier to match things up with downloaded transactions.\n\nIt's come a long way from its origins, and although I no longer need it for printing out the checks to pay my monthly bills, I can use it to track more complex financial concerns such as stocks, bonds, options trading, ESPP shares, employee stock options, the value of my home, my mortgage payments with an ongoing view of principal and interest, and even paychecks with the amount split to account for federal, state, and local taxes, FICA, medicare and deductions for 401(k)s (which end up in the appropriate account register automatically) or healthcare spending or ESPPs. It lets you keep track of spending by categories, and allows for tags (formerly classes) so you can track things in multiple directions. If you want to get a report on spending by category or figure out how much you spent on education or dining, it's easy. And if you tag things so that you know which expenses were for your 2006 Hawaii trip, you can know how much you spent in total or break it down by airfare, lodging, meals or souvenirs. You can even use foreign currency and account for exchange rates.  You can use as little or as many of these features as you want. You can establish budgets and see how well you've been doing for years or decades, depending on how long you've been using the product.\n\nThe product isn't perfect and still has a few bugs in it that affect usability but not the underlying financial integrity of your data. And some tasks are easier than others. Some of the wizards work from some places and not others. And some areas are not optimized for the type of security. For example, options trading is a thinly disguised version of stock trading, won't let you use standard actions such as \"sell to open\", \"buy to close\" or expire contracts based on the date in the symbol and the price of the underlying security. You might need to use less obvious terms such as buying to cover at zero cost in order to close out expired contracts. And you need to view things as shares instead of contracts. Plus there's no price history for options. And there's no support for RSUs, despite the fact that the people in charge of Quicken have been granted RSUs, and thus can't use the product to track their own finances in a comprehensive way.\n\nDespite the limitations, the product still covers the most common needs of most users. I'd like to see more emphasis on adding support for new features such as the ones I've mentioned, especially given that they aren't major programming tasks. I think the product has gotten so comprehensive that they are running out of ideas as to what to add for new releases.\n\nThe product also comes with three years of data service at no extra charge, after which you will most likely want to get a newer version. I think they would have had fewer detractors had they marketed the data service as a separate entity and let you know they are bundling it for free. The product itself does not expire, as many people think, but becomes a lot less useful once the data service expires and you can no longer download from your financial institutions. It's simply too expensive for the company to offer that kind of support for a longer period than what they cover, and it's cheap enough that even if you don't upgrade annually, it's worth getting a new version at least every two years.\n\nFour stars represents my overall satisfaction with respect to meeting my particular financial needs, but I'd give it five stars for value.", "summary": "Good overall", "unixReviewTime": 1395532800}

Johnson", "reviewText": "I am not going to beat around the bush here.  Windows 8 is the worst operating system I have ever had the misfortune of working with.  This is coming from someone that has used Windows ME and Vista.  I don't know what Microsoft was thinking in releasing OS or if they were even thinking at all. But apparently they only care about the \"next big thing\", and care nothing about people who actually use their software.  They also apparently don't have a QA department because I find it very hard to believe that any sane person would sign off on an OS with so many usability problems and bugs.  I don't know where to begin but to get started I will just take excerpts from an opinion I wrote about Windows 8 on another website and go from there.\n\nWindows 8 was clearly designed for a touchscreen, but not every one wants touchscreen, and not every windows application is compatible with touch screen. Users should not be forced to buy a computer that has touch screen just so they can use Windows 8. Windows 8 might work well on a tablet or phone, but it sucks as a desktop OS however Microsoft seems hell bent on shoving touch screen down our throats.  If people wanted a tablet or a phone, then guess what?  They would BUY a tablet or a phone.  Why try to force an OS designed for tablets or phones onto a desktop or laptop?\n\nTo my surprise Windows 7 ended up being a pretty good OS and I use it at work and many people also like Windows 7. However Microsoft had to go and ASSUME (like they always do) that we all want touch screen now and remove everything that worked so well in previous OS's.  i.e. the start button.  Pressing the windows key on Windows 8 will not bring up the start menu, but instead it will bring you to a poorly designed screen with stupid tiles every where making finding what you want a tedious task.  They hid everything from you and many times you have to search the web to get help to find what you are looking for.\n\nTouch screen is stupid for a desktop or laptop computer. The tiles, metro UI, or whatever you call it is idiotic and makes working in the OS an absolute nightmare. I couldn't care less about stupid teeny bopper Facebook or other social media crap. I just want to do what I need to do on the computer and not have to go through menu after menu of Nickelodeon type tiles just do a simple task. This OS isn't about productivity, its about pretty colors, and Facebook status updates. Microsoft seemed to forget people actually do WORK on their computers.  For example I VPN to my work network to work from home occasionally and I need remote desktop connection to connect to the many servers I use at work.  However because Windows 8 is so poorly designed, instead of just double clicking the mstsc application to open a new window, now double clicking it just brings up the existing connection, meaning I have to again search for the mstsc app, right click it and then click open new connection.  This takes a lot of time especially when I'm working on 3, 4, or 5 servers at the same time.  Even stuff like configuring a printer or getting into the control panel is an exercise in hair pulling frustration.  Switching between windows which what 99.999% of people who actually do WORK on a laptop do, is extremely cumbersome basically eliminating any hope of productivity.  Heck even turning the damn thing off, or logging a user off is made unnecessarily complicated. Who ever designed this OS or thought people would actually like this mess needs to be fired and banned from ever designing an OS again.\n\nLuckily the only computer in my household that had this turd of an operating system was my son's laptop.  But low and behold Windows 8 crashed for the 2nd time and now won't let me back in thanks to the endless \"We are automatically repairing your PC\". loop.  The automatic repair is just as useful as Window's assistant in previous operating systems.  Now I can't get into Windows at all so all the stuff is now gone.  Luckily I had the foresight not to put any important files on this computer so I really don't lose anything.  I'm writing this review on my Windows XP laptop I bought nearly 6 years ago, and other than a few hardware issues, the operating system itself has been pretty solid, which is much more than I can say about Windows 8.  Today I'm going to install Windows XP on my son's laptop and be done with it.  I should have done this as soon as my son got this laptop and I wouldn't be going through this today.\n\nWindows 8 is the reason I will never buy another laptop unless it comes with Windows 7. In addition, I will never even consider purchasing a Windows Tablet or a Windows phone. Words simply can't express how much I hate, loathe, despise, detest, abhor this operating system.  I can't wait to get it off my son's laptop and out of my life for good.", "summary": "Remove Windows 8 from your shopping cart and step away...", "unixReviewTime": 1388880000}

In this adventure Nancy is the new deputy curator at Beech Hill Museum in Washington D.C. The museum is almost ready to open its most impressive exhibit: a large collection of priceless Maya artifacts on loan from the Mexican government and private collectors. But shortly before the opening, one of the prized jade carvings is stolen from under Nancy's nose. The only clue is a vivid red handprint and a message in Maya glyphs left by the thief.\nFirst, let me say that, as someone who is seriously considering a master's degree in museum studies, this game was an absolute delight! The museum is filled with nooks and crannies to explore: the curator's office, the exhibition hall, a three-storey Maya temple, gardens, shipping and receiving and the lab, filled with neat gadgets such as an analyzer, foam packing machine, ham radio and more, all of which help Nancy on her quest.\n\"Secret of the Scarlet Hand\" simply offers more locations than previous games, more characters/suspects, and a much deeper storyline. Nancy travels to different locations by subway, with a static image overlay as the various station lights light up on the metro map. Graphics are, as always, beautiful. The Maya artifacts are photo realistic, extremely detailed and vibrant. Music and ambient sounds are more pronounced than in previous ND games. The score features haunting panpipes, rainforest birdcalls, and flamenco, along with more ominous mood music-although some reviewers though the music was too repetitive, I found that the soundtrack greatly enhanced the gaming experience.\nThis is definitely the most educational of the Nancy Drew games. Players must write down references to Mayan language, religion, rulers and more since there are three temple quizzes that Nancy must pass to progress in the game. Since it is set in a museum, the educational elements fit right into the game world without seeming out of place. \"Scarlet Hand\" is also the most difficult of the ND games to date, relying on a great deal of snooping, reading, Morse code transmissions in Spanish, telephone calls, and beating puzzles to progress in the investigation, but the great story and characters make it worth it.  Parents may find themselves roped into aiding investigations and end up playing the game themselves-there is plenty of variety in the various puzzles and tasks to keep the game interesting. Once again, Her Interactive has provided young girls with a positive, nonviolent role model in Nancy, and \"Scarlet Hand\" will be sure to thrill Nancy Drew/mystery fans, museum fans, and anyone looking for an engaging cultural journey. Not just for kids, \"Secret of the Scarlet Hand\" is an intelligent, gorgeous mystery with Mexican flavour and intrigue.", "summary": "&iexcl;Bienvenido al mundo de los maya!", "unixReviewTime": 1057795200}

On the other, this becomes less of a problem with each version that comes out as Microsoft continues to improve on getting them all to work together seamlessly. After my stint as a tech writer for Lotus Notes I can speak when confidence when I say that although I hate most of Office, I hate Microsoft's competitors so much more.  We got this for my wife, who works on a Mac.\n\nOf the programs included, we primarily use Word and Excel -- she more than I since she handles the finances -- and because I frequently create presentations for my speaking engagements, PowerPoint.  Never used OneNote. Ever.\n\nAs a student version, this edition doesn't include Access or Visio, which is fine with me. I used Access probably 10 years ago and gave up trying to create a database.  I didn't realize Visio was still around, having used it once back in the 90s before Microsoft brought it into the collective. Microsoft Office's biggest competitor has always been itself: I use Excel to track projects instead of Project and PowerPoint instead of Visio in both cases.\n\nSo what's new with this version?  Probably the biggest improvement is in collaboration.  Word and PowerPoint introduce co-authoring, which is basically typing on the same document, even in real time. A lot of this stuff are innovations that have been the de facto nature of working on the web for some time -- look kids, you can see who has access to a document (thanks Google docs!). There's also cross-platform collaboration (a necessity if you're going to introduce co-authoring) and a more natural help file integration.\n\nPerhaps because I've been working in an office at a Fortune Five company for 15+ years, the thing I'm most excited about is the new PowerPoint templates: treemap (which displays patterns), waterfall (trends moving both up and down), Pareto (useful for quality control in tracking to a data set), histogram (data frequency), box and whisker (uh, displays outliers but I don't have much use for it), and sunburst (a circle displaying hierarchical data).  It's the little things.\n\nIf you're new to Office, this isn't necessarily going to convince you of how awesome it is.

While I am sure this program had the best of intentions, it is really not for the beginner. To get things to happen takes a lot of effort as things just aren't set up intuitively. Even the tutorial seemed to start in the middle of the program. It didn't start by explaining what terms meant, what was the purpose behind the features, etc. While I understand this software is often used by people who are really good at animation - there is a \"beginner mode\" and it never really treated me like a beginner.\nI was also disappointed that you are immediately thrown into needed to \"upgrade\" to get creations to do the really neat things shown on the package. The start-up page presents you with options to buy additional characters. The developers should maybe take a lesson from Ap developers - first reel your customers in, then hit them with a desire to upgrade. Don't brag upfront about how I am going to need to spend more money to do the really \"cool\" stuff.\nI just couldn't in confidence recommend this software to anyone. I definitely wouldn't recommend it for the novice or beginner. And, I am too green with the software to know if it is the right fit for those who are much more advanced in Animation. The software just doesn't seem to know quite who it is targeting.\nI gave this software a lot of time to see if it would grow on me or if I would have an \"a ha\" moment and it just never happened.\nI guess the good things I can say about it was that it installed easily and you can get started within minutes. However, getting started is too strong of a word for my experience. It was more like - look through a tutorial and get stuck at the fourth page. Then, spend a long time try to make something cool happen only to never accomplish anything beyond changing some colors. I also didn't like that the software was constantly pushing me to download more content (free and paid). I was still trying to figure out the home page and I kept getting prodded to do more.

The free upgrade is not as obvious as using Windows Update:  instead it is posted in the Microsoft Store and you'll need to launch the Store to get to it.  From there, Microsoft has added what they call \"Update for Windows 8.1\", and the tweaks in this update (to the update) are remarkable improvements to the OS in subtle ways.  It's also important to note that a Windows 8.1 user will lose support for their product if it is not patched with \"Update for Windows 8.1\" a lot sooner than users of 8 or of 8.1 with the update.\n\nBEFORE YOU UPGRADE: stop by the Microsoft website and run the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant (link in the comments). This program will comb through your system and offer you detailed analysis of what will and won't upgrade. It offers links to articles that explain in detail what you may need to do, and it can save you a lot of headaches. For example, I have a laptop with no USB drivers--yet! I now have a link to the manufacturer's website that I've bookmarked and when drivers become available I'll upgrade that machine too.\n\nWindows 7 has been a well-received OS, so the case for upgrading to Windows 8 has been difficult for Microsoft to make. I've been using Windows 8 for a while now, and it truly is a mixed bag.  The easiest way to explain the difference is to say, \"Your Start Menu is now full-screen\":  we have a \"Modern UI\" (formerly called \"Metro\") that's designed to give you a splash of tiles, each of which represents a program on your machine.  When you want to find a specific program or setting, you just start typing and the results filter themselves accordingly right before your eyes.  Icons are now displayed as tiles of varying widths across your field of view and you scroll left-to-right to look through them. Some of this makes sense in that some of today's programs are more like the Windows Desktop Gadgets we've seen in Vista and 7: rather than needing to be launched, they idly stream information to you, and need a bit more room to be easy to read than the older Start Menu could have allowed for. If you've used Windows Media Center, Office 2010, or an XBox 360, you've already been interacting with similar interfaces. This sort of UI has been slowly making its way into Microsoft's products for a while now.\n\nThe Windows 8 desktop looks exactly like it did in Windows 7 and Vista, except there's no Start Button: you're expected to press the Windows key or move your mouse to the bottom corner of the screen to launch the tile dashboard. The desktop has the tray of running programs you're used to in earlier versions, shows you wallpaper, and offers access to the Windows Explorer for looking through the files on your hard drive. All programs can be launched directly off the tile screen, and while Windows 8 apps always run in full-screen, older programs run from within the Desktop and can be resized. We have a version of Internet Explorer accessible from the desktop that looks just like IE 9 did in Windows 7, then we have a version of Internet Explorer in the tile screen that looks entirely different. Some parts of the Control Panel have the tile look and feel and the options cascade left-to-right like the Home screen in any MS Office 2010 or 2013 product. Other parts of the Control Panel look exactly like they did in Windows 7 and before. Unfortunately, I haven't found a good pattern for this yet: you may flip from one side to the other in order to do something like troubleshoot a network problem.\n\nThis is really the heart of Windows 8's problems:  its identity crisis.  It can be jarring to flip back and forth between Modern and Desktop views, but Microsoft can't let completely go of everything that came before without driving people even crazier, so there will be times you're trying to do a thing--like manage users or configure a network connection--and you might be in Modern's full-screen left-to-right only to find yourself dumped into the desktop and shown a dialog box you may remember from earlier versions...and then you need to head back to Modern to take another step.  If you're doing everyday computing, like reading documents or checking mail, you don't run across this too often, but the moment you need to take step outside of the ordinary, good luck figuring out which path you should start from, or which you'll end up on.\n\nPerformance-wise, Windows had been slowly moving away from always-running programs that drain performance to background services that would launch programs as needed...but this too started to get unwieldy. Microsoft have stripped several services out of Windows 8 which by default makes the OS more efficient than 7. Any machine that could run 7 can also run 8. Programs that used to run, shut down, then have to be fully re-launched to run again are instead put in a standby mode so they can launch faster when called again. The Windows Vista and 7 \"Aero effects\" that gave your windows a glassy sheen and rounded corners used graphics and CPU to run, so they've been stripped out of the tile UI in favor of simple color schemes and blocky edges (though you can still see a subdued glassy effect on the Desktop). Interaction with Windows in this new look and feel is easier if you have a touchscreen or you're using a tablet, and if you're a Windows Phone user the territory is already pretty familiar. The downside for mouse users is that you occasionally spend time hunting along the edges of the screen for scrollbars and dragging screens around to be able to interact with everything.  Sometimes you can use the wheel to scroll and sometimes you can't. My chief complaint with Windows 8 hasn't been with the Tile layout so much as the fact that the scroll bars are too skinny.\n\nFor some features, time will tell. I've found the Tile UI version of the browser to be less compatible and more cranky with websites, but I expect that to change given time. I like the fact that security/antivirus are rolled into the OS without me having to take care of them or be interrupted with update notifications. The OS runs Windows Updates on a schedule that's far less aggressive than previous versions and won't nag you about rebooting when it needs to. I've been told that the performance for gaming is supposed to be greater simply by virtue of a cleaner codebase, but I haven't seen anything substantially different on the PC apart from faster boot-up and shut-down times (I did benchmark my machine with 3DMark11 and, after some adjusting, noticed a higher score). The basic applications like Weather, Photos, Stocks, Mail, and more are very user-friendly, but solely within the context of the new look & feel: expect little familar ground and a lot of new territory, and the assumption that you should be using a touchscreen. If you have a Windows Live account and/or SkyDrive, these can integrate fully into the OS: so much so that you would sign in to the computer with your Windows Live/Hotmail account and everything you do would be synced to Microsoft's cloud if your account has SkyDrive.\n\nWindows 8 requires you to purchase a license for Windows Media Center separately; you still have Windows Media Player, but the Center is a separate application now, available for sale in the Microsoft Store.\n\nUPDATE, 11/2013: Microsoft has now released Windows 8.1, a minor update to the OS that mostly attempts to make the user experience better. If you purhcase this copy of Windows 8, you will be offered the ability to update it to 8.1 at no additional cost. The upgrade is pushed through the Windows Store that is part of Windows 8. Personally, I've done clean installs of 8.1 from the MSDN media and done an in-place upgrade via the store, on both my desktop and laptop, and have not had good experiences. I don't personally recommend the update at this time for that reason. Perhaps with time it will get better.", "summary": "A Forward Step Held Back by its Past", "unixReviewTime": 1384214400}
