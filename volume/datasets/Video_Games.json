Where do I start? This game is just incredible. I have played many games in my day, but this one has made me completely rethink how good an action game can be. The story even turns out to be epic too, with tons of funny moments that happen in cut scenes between all the action. This game also happened to be my first entry into the Bayonetta universe, and I absolutely loved it. AND as an added bonus,  when I bought this game I got the first Bayonetta remastered for Wii U, for FREE! I still haven't gotten around to playing that one! Anyway,  back to review. They also included a bunch of collectables in the game that are spread out across the game's campaign, and sometimes hidden in devious places. Also included are numerous unlockable characters that you can use in the campaign or the optional co-op online mode which pits you against variations of enemies you have faced over the course of the game. The only problem I had with this mode, is that it is cooperative,  yet if you don't get a better score than the other player,  you hardly get any halos. (The currency in the game.) For me, that ruined the mode. If I don't get any reward for at least trying I can't see why I would play it. Still, it is a fun diversion but for those who like to stick solely to single player, there are a plethora of things to do. And the game is not all action all the time, there are moments when you can explore the game's world and talk to various characters in the game casually and just take in the scenery. Which for me was a great change of pace. All in all, this is a phenomenal game, for both action junkies, and action newbies alike, and I whole heartily say that it is one every Wii U owner should have.", "summary": "Must Haves for Wii U?

I never knew if I was going to like it since the Monster Hunter genre doesn't really do it for me for very long, it gets repetitive and boring fast usually. When I read that Kiwami was coming out I thought it was a perfect time to check it out again and luckily they released a demo on ps4 and that's when I got hooked. I did all the tutorials for all the weapons and it had so much depth in the combat system that I was extremely intrigued.\n\nI bought the game through Sony and have over 35 hours into it already and I just hit ch7 and I'm pretty sure it goes to ch14 or something. It has a ton of content and can easily replace any mmo in terms of engagement. Although it can feel repetitive at times usually when it gets to that point something interesting happens/unlocks or I find myself learning more and more about the game. I enjoy the fights a lot, the AI is great and helpful, the strategy of switching weapons based on certain bosses is a lot of fun to me. The amount of weapon/armor and mitama customization is through the roof. You can create any type of build you want and that's so cool. Whether that's high crit, high defense, high attack, high elemental damage. You can have a fast based combat, slow based, air based, range based. You can forge and craft and and and and... lots more :)\n\nI'm happy I bought this game, especially on the ps4 because it looks great and the big screen is awesome.\n\nI also want to note that Remote play on PS Vita is flawless and extremely easy to play. I think PS4 is the better option just because of the Vita remote play versatility in bed. Great game!

I guess if the only RPGs you've ever played are on the Playstation, it might seem difficult. But if I were to criticize its challenge level, I would say it's not hard enough.\nThere are a few quirks; if you want some of the extras, you have to walk on every step of certain dungeons. But since you can get out of random battles by talking to monsters, this is much less frustrating than in could be. This game also shows some of Japan's less savory aspects; one of the adult female characters is slightly obsessed with getting a boyfriend. But since she's a strong, foul-mouthed kickboxer, this isn't quite as irritating as it could be. And the characters are generally likeable, interesting, and believable -- and you'll learn something about modern Japan from their interactions. Plus, you can shape their growth by equipping them with a Persona that will increase a certain stat that they need help with, or that is their most important aspect.\nThe voice acting is very good, the graphics are nice, the monster designs are delightfully kooky, and the anime sequences are great. This is a game for teenagers and adults; not because it's especially violent or sexual, but because it's mature. It takes patience to unlock all the extras and grow your Personas, which allow you to use magic and do necessary combos with others. It also takes judgement to decide which Personas to use.

Lets take a closer look:\n\nSINGLE PLAYER STORY: I think they did a terrible job wrapping up the story.  The final 'boss' was horribly chosen and to be honest everyone who came up to this point without having the ending spoiled was expecting a certain entity to be the final boss.  It wasn't, and the way they wrapped up the story was pretty sloppy too.  I was seeking a more definitive conclusion to the saga and I was not satisfied.\n\nSINGLE PLAYER LEVEL DESIGN: Most of the levels were pretty well done with the exception of The Ark and The Covenant.  These levels were terribly designed and are extremely repetitive, boring, and involved WAY too much backtracking.  This almost felt like doing Assault on the Control Room from Halo #1 all over again.  This is only one bad part of the game however.  Enough of the reminiscing though, on to the good stuff.  The rest of the game feels ALIVE.  I sat there and looked around during the first time I gained control of my character for almost five minutes.  It was truly awe-inspiring.\n\nSINGLE PLAYER SKULLS: As you probably heard, skulls have made a big transition to Halo 3.  They are now obtainable on Normal and Heroic as well as Legendary.  Doing this was a step in the right direction---HOWEVER they messed up on placement of a few of the skulls.  IWHBYD, and Famine made me want to kill somebody they were so difficult to access.  For example, IWHBYD involves recreating the original Halo theme song by jumping through miniature Halos in a specific order.  Of course, there was no way to tell if you were doing it right or wrong or if it bugged up and you did a hour long mission for nothing.  It's stupid stuff like this that irritates me and is extremely frustrating having to redo a boring long level over and over again to see if it finally works properly.  Finally, they made the right choice and made the skulls able to be activated at the Campaign menu.  And depending on which skulls you activate, you will receive multipliers based on your meta game score (if campaign scoring is turned on).\n\nSINGLE PLAYER REPLAYABILITY: The replay value of the Single Player portion of Halo 3 is solely based on whether or not you have interest in competitively doing speed runs with skulls activated with 3 other friends of yours against other teams online.  If you have no interest in competition of any shape or form, then this is not worth forking $60 over to play.  The campaign is around 7-15 hours, but this fluctuates around what difficulty you are playing on, if you are doing it on Co-op mode, etc.  All in all, the Single Player portion of Halo 3 is where this game falls short.  It is simply not that much fun killing Brutes, Grunts, Flood, and Jackals.\n\nMULTIPLAYER LEVEL DESIGN: For the most part, very well done.  I like the new levels, although I wasn't very impressed by Bungie recycling/revamping old levels.  The new and original levels are extremely well thought out and work very well.  The man cannons are extremely fun to throw grenades into, and they add a whole new level of fun to multiplayer.  My favorite level is The Pit, every area of that level is designed specifically for one weapon each.  One area is extremely suited towards snipers, while in another area the snipers will have problems in.  For the most part, the new levels are by far their best.  I hope they add more original levels in soon, because I am looking  forward to seeing more of the awesome that is Halo 3 Multiplayer.\n\nMULTIPLAYER GAMEPLAY: With the addition of deployable items, there is now a whole new level of strategy and skill involved in multiplayer.  My jaw fell to the floor when my Spartan Laser beam was blocked by a player dropping his bubble shield right before impact.  It is stuff like this and moments like these that make Halo 3 the best party/competitive multiplayer game out there.  Bungie has balanced everything and it feels like you are at an equal footing with other players whether they are wielding a Spartan Laser or a Needler.  The only gripe I have is the Gravity Hammer...that thing seriously needs to be balanced a little bit more.\n\nMULTIPLAYER REPLAYABILITY: All I have to say is that I will probably be playing this game online for quite some time from now (possibly a year or two?).  Bungie really came through and multiplayer was improved in every category.  Nothing but love here for all.\n\nOTHER MULTIPLAYER ADDITIONS: By far the most notable was the ability to unlock and modify the look of your Spartan/Elite.  You unlock the armor by getting achievements, collecting skulls, and doing certain feats in multiplayer.  My favorite armor was the Hayabusa set for the Spartan.  Being an old Ninja Gaiden fan for the Xbox, this was just too awesome to pass up not getting.\n\n======================== TLDR VERSION==============================\nGRAPHICS: They are very good looking overall and I think that they are very impressive compared to the other games in the 360's library.  The environment detail is nowhere near the detail of Gears of War's, but this is made up for in the particle effects, explosions, and player models.  The multiplayer environment detail is a downgrade from the single player's, but that is only to help make the framerate better and help prevent graphical lag.\n\nGAMEPLAY OVERALL: Very good, although it is nothing revolutionary after the past two games.  The multiplayer is still freakin awesome though.\n\nSOUND: A lot of the sounds sound more crisp than they did before.  The Spartan Laser's firing noise will make the wielder feel like a titan the first time they hear it.  The music sounds too much like its previous incarnations, I honestly thought at first that they recycled the original music from the first two games when I first heard the songs again.\n\nAnd the final question remains....should you buy it?\n\nThe answer to this question is...yes if you have Xbox Live or you plan on having a ton of LAN parties in the near future.  Multiplayer in Halo 3 is the only reason it isn't discarded as an average game, and anyone can see why.  However if you do not have multiplayer capability or you are just not crazy about it, just rent it.", "summary": "If only single player was better...", "unixReviewTime": 1191369600}

Comfortable, excellent sound, high-quality feeling.  There are 2 cord attachments in the box in addition to the usual game connection setup - one to use the headset with a phone and one to use it with an iPod or similar, so they are not just gaming headphones.\n\nNormally Im not the toaster oven type (lousy toaster and lousy oven, but you get both!), but I used these as regular audio headphones for a 7 hour flight and loved them the whole way.  The ear cups are super comfortable and don't make my ears sweat.  I've also used the headset a few times for phone calls, something I would never have expected, and they worked great.\n\nAs for gaming, great there too.  The sound is excellent and controls work well with some tweaking (in other words, once you realize you shouldn't turn the mic gain up all the way).  The connections work roughly the same as every gaming headset, though the cable lengths are a little more generous.  The main power+audio cable also had a nice velcro strip which is handy for tying up extra length.\n\nIm not a professional audio engineer or anything like that, I always feel a little goofy saying that headphones sound great and the other reviewers complain about the lows or the high end or something.  Im just going to say they sound excellent to me and I'm not hard of hearing.\n\nThe only complaint I have is the layout of the control module - like every one of these headsets I've owned, its kind of poorly thought out.  There are 5 - five! - different control knobs.  Bass, Trebel, Mic Gain, Chat Volume, Game Volume.  Its too much, you plug the headphones in, the volume is too high and you're trying to figure out which one to turn while your ears get blasted - the volume control knob in no way stands out from the others; it is just another knob lost in the jungle of controls.  Worse yet, with all those knobs arranged along the edge, when you grip the control module to disable your game mic, for example, you will accidentally adjust several of them.  It drives me a little nuts - but every game headset is designed this way, does no one actually play-test these things?\n\nThis is a flaw that every gaming headset has, so I debated if I should subtract a star and decided not to - this headset is just too awesome.

Lots of action.\nThere are quite a few problems though. One, your allies do nothing. The path of the king levels are you with legolas and gimli. They do nothing and it is all you. Another huge problem is some levels are stupid. The path of the king levels are boring. It isn't fun hacking the dead over and over because it feels meaningless. Then it comes to the worst level of the game, the dead king. You beat him(a hard battle) then you run to the exit. I fight and get outnumbered 50 to one but I still beat the undead somehow. Still, if you've played it numerous times then you will know what I am talking about. Sometimes random rocks fall and kill you. There is NOTHING you can do. I have played the level a billion times because I just die to some random rock falling or because I go a little backwards.\nThe game does have its good points. Good characters, some extras, and awesome environments(with the exclusion of the first few aragorn levels). The bad points though greatly overshadow the good.

Crecca", "reviewText": "I am going to start off this review saying that I have played every CoD game since the original Call of Duty.  I will say that Treyarch did an amazing job trying to catch up, or even surpass the juggernaut MW and MW2.  However this game does come with some of its own problems.  Like many people have said, this game is built for consoles with PC gamers second in mind.  Personally this ticks me off considering that CoD started as a PC franchise and was ported to consoles.  Now it seems like it is a console franchise with a port to PC.  This is totally unacceptable for any studio considering that PC gaming has been around a lot longer than console gaming and in my personal opinion will be the console king for the FPS genre.  Where would the FPS genre be without one of the best original PC FPS games... Doom?\n\nWith all of that said, this does not mean the game is not fun in any way.  My biggest complaint is that the controls are not as tight as they were in MW and MW2.  It will take a little bit of getting use to but not too long.  I have used a Logitech G9x for MW,MW2, and now Black Ops and I noticed a significant difference in look movement.  The multiplayer is extremely addicted as you would expect from any CoD multiplayer and Wager matches are just too much fun to pass by.  I personally like the system of CoD points as opposed to ranking up for new guns/attachments/perks/killstreaks ect.  All the maps seem to be pretty balanced with 1 or 2 exceptions.\n\nIf you are a serious FPS comptetive player like myself, you should not hesitate to pick this up IF and ONLY IF you have somewhat of a beefy computer.  I have an i7 960, 12gb RAM, and 2 nVidia GTX 480s in SLI and it runs perfectly.  I know some people have complained that it requires too much in order to play but unfortunately thats the price you pay for wanting a PC game.  New games like this will continue to require bigger and better components to be able to run them. This goes back tot he reason why this is now a PC port.  Most people, especially now, don't have the financial means to build/buy a $4,000 gaming computer just to play games like this when they can buy a $300 X-Box or PS3 and play the same game.\n\nBottom Line:  If you love fast paced FPS games, and you have a beefy gaming computer... do not pass this game up.\n\nNote:  If I were to rank the 3 major titles of PC CoD games (MW 1, MW 2, and Black Ops) it would go like this\n1.  Modern Warfare 1\n2.  Black Ops\n3.  Modern Warfare 2\n\nWhy Black Ops over MW2?  1 reason... dedicated servers.", "summary": "Good Addition to the Franchise but...", "unixReviewTime": 1290124800}

No, KOEI didn't deliver as much as I expected, but when your expectations were as high as mine, you can't expect perfection (notice I still gave this 5 stars!).\nWhat's good about DW4 is actually great. KOEI decided that it would finally have normal enemies do damage to your character and attack you en masse, rather than wait for you to kill off whoever you were fighting at the time. This has the effect of making the game much more exciting; you must constantly change your perspective so that you don't get ambushed by another officer/grunt. Also, it is no longer possible to immediately run through and get every character's most powerful weapon (as was the case in DW3 and Xtreme Legends). Instead, you must play with one character long enough to power up his initial weapon (via a weapon experience system) before the fabled level 10 weapon can be obtained. Also, officers sometimes duel with you, and these duels are immensely fun, and are often times just as nervewracking as a 30-1 battle! There are multiple storylines, multiple movies, and hidden Musou missions for Lu Bu, Yuan Shao, Dong Zhuo, etc. The graphics are very nice (although this was never a problem with DW3), and the gameplay is top notch.\nWhere the game disappoints is in its use of its advertised Siege Engine. KOEI had promised a more strategic element, where the player could use catapults, battering rams, etc. in order to get a tactical advantage over his opponent. However, this fails to deliver; really, the only advantage of using the Siege Engine elements is the ability to see some cut scenes. I mean, this is nice, but it isn't strategical. I was a bit disappointed here.\nHowever, this game continues to be the best hack-n-slash battle simulation on the market. I strongly urge any fan of the original to buy this, as well as anyone who just wants to have some mindless fun. However, if you were intrigued by the possibility of a more mental engagement, this game isn't for you.

You won't be able to put the system in your pocket if its on the cradle but it does allow you to bring the cradle along, just in case your 3DS starts to run dry. If there is one draw back it's that the charging cradle does get a bit warm if you decide to play and charge at the same time.", "summary": "Great alternative to a battery pack", "unixReviewTime": 1341014400}

I'm a long time Battlefront fan and have played several of the original games on the Xbox and the Sony PSP.  For those who aren't familiar with Battlefront, you should know that it's an arcade style FPS.  It doesn't have much in the way of depth (RPG elements).  That's not a bad thing though . Sometimes you might prefer a beer & pretzels type game that you can just put in and quickly start playing with some friends.  So, far I really like what I see.  The game is gorgeous!  Tremendous graphics and sound.  You feel like you are bathing in Star Wars.  The controls are terrific.  I've played the the training missions, so far and have no complaints.  I did notice, however, that there is NO campaign mode.  Very disappointed with that and it costs this game a star in my view. I noticed the game really really wants you to buy a season pass and has some in-game purchases, but I'm not biting until I play the game more. I'll post an update after a while to see if I've changed my stance on this game.  So far, it's thumbs up!\n\nUpdate 04/10:  Played this game for a while now and I'm taking a star off.  This game is most definitely not worth a $60 price tag.  It's about as dumbed down an arcade shooter as you can get.  You have no control over your spawning.  In old Battlefront you could choose to spawn at any base your side had control of.  Not here.  The game decides where you spawn........and it's often in very bad spots.  Let's put it this way.  If the other side has a hero in play, you will be guaranteed to be placed near where that player is.  It's happened to me way too many times to be a coincidence.  I think the game serves you up to the hero on purpose.  My next point of contention is the lack of any meaningful single player content.  It gives you crumbs, like the Survival mode which is boring beyond belief.  Then you have almost nothing in the way of player customization or advancement.  You get to choose from a variety of different faces, hairstyles and some lame emotes.  With only 11 different weapons available, there's not much replay value for the long haul.  That's sort of why I haven't played it all that much in the last few months.  The game just doesn't give you a whole lot.  Although they did include the very laughable diorama.  Yes, a diorama.  You unlock various diorama pieces throughout the game and then they appear int he diorama.  LOL.  They threw in the these weak little add ins to give you the illusions that you are actually getting some content with this game.  If you are one of the unlucky folks who ponied up $100+ for the game plus the ridiculous season pass, you have really been hosed.  This is a $30 game at best and the extra DLC content is just what should have been included in the original.", "summary": "The Force is okay with this one......", "unixReviewTime": 1447804800}

I probably wouldn't have played this game if it wasn't for having a child, but I would have missed out. It's nice and relaxing, fun and informative.

This is easily one of the best games out there at the moment. Yes, there are few issues for the PC which curbed my initial excitement upon first playing. I was really disappointed at not being able to just right click to move, as that's been a series staple since the beginning. Removing it serves no real benefit from the 25 hours I've been playing. I get how they sort of made two \"modes\" to the game and combat, the tactical view and a sort of action / hybrid where you directly control a character.\n\nI actually like this way of combat but the tactical view needs some work on the pc. For one, it zooms in too close when switching to it, making it useless inside. You actually have a better view of your people and the battlefield in the normal view.  The path finding for melee characters when using the tactical view needs work. They constantly shuffle and rework themselves trying to get in the position where you sent them, losing valuable combat time and taking needless damage. For ranged characters it works fine but controlling my melee main character in tactical view was almost useless. Some tweaks to that will actually make it useful.\n\nSecondly, you can't queue up commands. Which is kinda baffling. At least let us go two deep so I can move a character someplace then queue up an attack or spell for them to do once they get there. After you send them someplace, like sending a mage out of the fight zone, they always never stay there and end up needlessly putting themselves next to bad guys taking area of effect damage. (I found out you can press shift and click for them to move and hold a position). It's a little frustrating. Addressing some of these issues, at least with the camera being goofy in tactical view would solve a lot of the \"PC USER RAGE\" that you see in the reviews.\n\nAlso the PC interface is needlessly cluttered. Quest stuff is huge and takes up a good portion of the right side of the screen. The map has no drawing on it so it's just a clear background that doesn't show landmarks or the lay of the land, only enemies and your quest marker, making it not as effective as it could be. Especially since it too takes up a big fat space on your screen.\n\nAlso, at the beginning I had some crash to desktop and one super scary bug during rift fights that cause my entire computer to wonk out to a black screen with the only recourse to hard reboot. I had just gotten a new video card and was worried I had got a bad one. So I spent a few hours trouble shooting my card, testing components to  make sure I didn't have a faulty card. That was hours wasted. I know the 970s just came out and so did the game but come on.\n\nWith all that being said I still enjoy the game. The graphics are awesome and everything looks gorgeous if you have the power to run it. The game runs good for me on high settings. Combat is fun once you get used to it and I actually enjoy it more than Origins and 2 because it combines the best of both worlds. The action combat and tactical management could be better meshed, but I think that can be addressed with some tweaks.\n\nThe story so far isn't earth shattering, it's still fun and enjoyable to follow. I've read a few of the later books and it's nice to see some subtle ties to them. Though I felt like the whole \"You're the world's savior\" was a little rushed. You're practically the world's savior within the span of hours, with leaders and rulers deferring to you as their commander too easily. Cassandra goes from thinking you're a criminal to making you head of the inquisition within an hour or so of the game. It just felt a little unbelievable.\n\nAfter that the story gets going and has been pretty fun. Sadly, I haven't been impressed with BioWare character design since Origins. Half the cast of DA:I seem meant for a lesser game, nothing really inspiring about them. Though I felt they were much better than 2. Solas seemed a throwaway character for me but ends up being my main guy. Though it seems like they've made half the characters bisexual just to push the envelope. Dorian is a flamboyant openly gay mage and so are half the female characters. The Iron Bull looks like he's wearing drag make up and Sera is just plain ugly. I not trying to sound like  a hater but for me it was a little off putting. It's not that bad though, Dorian is cool and Sera is one of my favorite characters, her personality is funny and cool. I just hope it fits in with the story.\n\nSo if you're a fan of the first two should you buy this? If you generally liked 2 then yes, you'll love this one. I enjoyed both Origins and 2 for different reasons and beat both of them. I enjoy this one on it's own merits and felt like BioWare did a fantastic job with the game. There are so many things to do and see, sort of like Skyrim but with a better story and better cinematics for your character. Skyrim I always felt was too boring in some aspects, though I loved it I never felt truly invested in my character, I was just a faceless and emotionless pair of hands. Here you really feel invested in who you create and how you shape the world, and to me that is awesome.\n\nSo if you loved Origins but hated 2, and not much of a fan anymore then the answer is maybe. Watch some videos and read some reviews but they've made the game more \"action oriented\" and less Baldurs Gate / Origins tactical. I loved the hybrid approach but you may not.\n\nOverall this is a phenomenal game, don't listen to 1 star reviews as that is just asinine. There are many things to love here but a few things need help. If you can get past them you will find a lot to enjoy and love.", "summary": "Just a few hairs shy of a masterpiece.", "unixReviewTime": 1417824000}

Fortunately, Rayman Legends is a tremendously fun and brilliantly designed title that is the very definition of a must-have for fans of the hop-heavy genre.\n\nThe release takes Origins' fundamentals and polishes them to within an inch of their life. The controls are as tight as ever, allowing you to run, jump, swim, swing, and glide through the environments so smoothly that it's as if you're not really controlling your character at all, but working on instinct and manipulating the action with your mind. Levels are so meticulously detailed that you'll be blown be away by their delicious visuals, charmed by their impediments, and delighted once you master their unique challenges. And through all of these emotions, a stunning score will add peaks to your enjoyment, driving your adrenaline through difficult stages, and calming your blood pressure as you explore. This is a game that masterfully links each individual part of its makeup into an exquisite whole, culminating in a true sensory treat.\n\nWhile its predecessor was fairly narrative-driven, Legends puts much of its focus on content. Rayman and his friends are awoken a century after the events of Origins to find the Teensies  peculiar wizard fellows  have been captured by Dark Teensies, and the Glade of Dreams has been overrun with demons and monstrosities. It's up to the limbless hero and his friends to save the land and retrieve the mythical creatures. Of course, this rescue mission provides loose context for a slew of different environmental themes, spanning castles, lush jungles, dank swamps, and more. You even get to explore under the sea, and the fiery horrors of a nightmarish kitchen. There's an unbelievable amount of variety  with many of the best levels from Ubisoft Montpellier's previous adventure revisited for good measure.\n\nIt's not just a question of visual variety either. While precision platforming is certainly the order of the day  demanding impeccable timing and focus  it's augmented with stealth sections, boss battles, and more. The sheer number of ideas on display prevents the action from ever outstaying its welcome, with even minor minigames such as Kung Foot  a competitive multiplayer mode where two teams battle it out trying to score goals by jumping and attacking the ball  bringing hours of entertainment. However, it's the music levels that truly take the crown. Featuring a Rayman remix of a classic song, these stages push you to the right while a backing track plays, with your jumps, attacks, and general interactions overlaying accompanying melodies. It literally results in a symphony that's written in gameplay, which is perhaps the biggest compliment that you could possibly pay such an imaginative set of levels.\n\nWhile you'll need focus to beat the main campaign, adding three other players to the action via drop-in/drop-out co-op brings a chaotic dynamic to the affair. Multiplayer is a barrel of laughs and negates the challenge a touch, with death resulting in your character blowing up like balloon, waiting to be tagged back into play with a slap from one of your team mates. However, it can get confusing with so many players on screen, and detracts ever so slightly from the pure presentational treat that you'll derive from the single player mode. It's not bad, it's just different  and it's a testament to the quality of the title's design that it manages to appeal in both options. I enjoyed exploring the levels alone first, and then returning with friends to gobble up Lums, where standing on each others' shoulders makes it easier to reach those high hanging goodies.\n\nAdding buddies to the mix is also useful for handling the duties of Murphy, a floating frog-type fellow who aids you occassionally in levels by interacting with the environment. In single player, once Murphy appears, he'll automatically fly over to the next object that he can interact with, including platforms, enemies, and ropes. This mechanic is a remnant from the game's original Nintendo Wii U exclusive days, where the Gamepad's touch screen is used to navigate the amphibian, while the computer takes control of Rayman. Here on the PS3, the automated solution works fairly well. You don't have the accuracy that you would with the Gamepad, but you don't lose control of the main character. However, it doesn't always flow; the pace of the game can reach such speeds that using Murphy is unwieldy. Fortunately, another player can take control of the sidekick in multiplayer, allowing everyone else to concentrate on surviving the stage.\n\nWith six worlds, oodles of collectibles, co-op, re-mastered stages, and more, Rayman Legends is absolutely bursting with content. It can feel a little overwhelming at first, but once you start freeing Teensies and opening up the game, it's hard not to want to sample everything. Each individual level is packed with its own challenges, including grabbing the aforementioned Lums. These happy-go-lucky organisms unlock scratch cards  another leftover from the Wii U release  that you rub away at with the analogue sticks to unlock even more content, including the previously touched upon Rayman Origins stages, as well as creatures which generate more Lums for you to collect.\n\nFinally, there are daily and weekly online challenges, which task you to promptly gather up Lums, dash through a level, or survive for as long as possible while something deadly gives chase. Your score is uploaded to the leaderboards, and you're rewarded with tiered trinkets and Lums depending on how well you performed compared to the rest of the community. It can be a little frustrating watching your gold trophy decline as others compete and the score thresholds for the awards adapt, but it's a compelling mode that will pull you in for multiple runs as you attempt to better your score.\n\nConclusion\n\nRayman Legends winds up with a fistful of content and scores a knock-out blow with its impressive visuals, infectious audio, and exceptional controls. Some of the Wii U features may struggle to translate, but this game still more than lives up to its name, and is destined for a place among the platforming elite. Chaotic with friends and addictive alone, this will leave you intoxicated by its charm, and with so much to do, it won't outstay its welcome anytime soon.", "summary": "A Great Game (Detailed Review)", "unixReviewTime": 1394928000}

Revolutionary? Where do you even start to describe a game like Sins?  As a strategy game it's a completely new take on the genre.  As a the first game from a brand new indie developer it's downright unprecedented in it's scope, ambition, polish, and overall quality.\n\nIt's rather difficult to describe a game like Sins, as you have quite certainly never played anything like it.  It's a real time strategy, but if you're expecting Starcraft or Homeworld you will be sorely disappointed.  In its scope an pacing the game plays much more like another Stardock game, Galactic Civ 2.\n\nWhat makes this game so fantastic is its sheer, uncompromising depth.  Traditional RTS games look practically primitive next to Sins.  This is a complex game that makes absolutely no apologies for being such.  While this may be off-putting for those expecting a traditional RTS click-fest, it makes it all that much sweeter to the gamers who it is really targeted at, 4X fans.\n\nIf the game's depth elevates it above traditional RTS titles, it's the visual immersion that elevates it above traditional 4X games.  A grid of static images that most turn based 4X games offer you doesn't even come close to the experience of seeing a fleet of hundreds of ships ranging from 10m long fighters to 1km long capital ships maneuvering around a massive planet all rendered to scale.  In a word, Sins of the Solar Empire is gorgeous.\n\nThis is not a game for everyone.  Today's console crowd weened on fast paced shooters and action titles will likely not have the patience for it.

I owned 'wipEout Fusion' for PS2 and loved it almost as much as XL.  Played that a ton too.\nBut this new wipEout is pretty boring.  The battle mechanic is so tame that weapons are pointless.  And i miss the pitstops, which takes away much strategy.\n\nThey pretty much made this game into just racing..  what weapons/items you acquire are non-memorable.. and it's practically impossible to die because you can just keep devouring weapons/items instead of using them.  In old wipeout games you didn't get any benefit from discarding an item other than freeing up your inventory for the next weapon-pad you ran across.  But in this game we get fed significant energy upon discarding..  which is so stupid.  because i never can die.\n\nThe only time you might die or kill anything are in those certain special bonus tracks where combat is enforced and you have to take a more tanky craft to race with.  Those levels are even more boring than the normal tracks. these bonus tracks have emphasis on combat and yet hardly anything dies and the speed is slow.  you can just keep feeding off of weapon-pads and last forever.\n\nIn the old wipEout XL for pso, i had to be very careful and always on my toes and there was always a threat of danger and you could strategically decide if taking the time to pitstop was worth it.  In every match i'd kill at least some opponents or die trying.\n\nBut in this new vita wipEout 2048 i find myself just cruising around gracefully.. riding walls without fear of death because i know i can just eat more weapons.. and since weapons almost never are useful for killing or slowing anything you are better off just ignoring that and just using them for consumption.  I've been playing this vita game for about 3 years now and i can only recall maybe a few times i actually saw something die.\n\nin XL i died like all the time.  in 2048 i cant remember the last time i died.\n\nXL gave me excitement and kept me on the edge of my seat..  but 2048 makes me zone out and think of other things.\n\nit is not a bad racing game, but definitely is poorly thought out and is the worst of the series, that i have played.\n\nHere is what i want for the next wipEout:\nI want pitstops back..\ni want to fear death..\ni want it easy to die.\nI should be able to eliminate all opponents in a given match.  In XL i could do that.\ni want discarding weapons/items to NOT feed you any health..\ni want traps back and weapons to stun or do significant damage\nI want to be able to aim better.\ni want to have a reason to use rear-view mirror like i use to do in xl, where i could shoot people behind me.\nI want better music:  the music in this game is tame by comparison to XL and Fusion.  no tune is memorable in 2048.\n\nand i want all of this in regular tracks; i don't want to play 'special combat' tracks for this effect... which still fails miserably and lacks all that i said above.  i avoid those levels in 2048 because they just don't seem fun in how they are handled.\n\nI don't understand the glaringly positive reviews for this game.  those people are clearly not wipEout vets like me.  i bet they just played it a little here and there and noticed the speed and graphics and instantly gave it good remarks without taking the time to see what was stripped away.\n\nThis game feels like the fisher-price of the series... i think it was toned down for kids because of online-play.. so that there would be no crybabies complaining about getting shot down.", "summary": "Missing threat of death, usefulness of weapons and pitstops!", "unixReviewTime": 1505520000}

If you're a fan of scrolling 2D spaceship shooters such as Gradius, R-Type, Ikaruga, etc., you'll definitely get your money's worth.  The main difference is this game doesn't exactly scroll per se.  The gameplay itself is 2D and is projected on top of a 3D background with a moving and rotating camera, creating the impression that you're zooming through the corridors of a large metallic ship.  You (thankfully) can't crash into the walls, but the position of your ship onscreen sometimes affects which of multiple \"paths\" through the stage you'll take.\n\nThe control scheme also takes a different approach.  You use the left analog stick to move and the right to fire, similar to the arcade classic Smash TV or its precursor Robotron:2084.  This allows you to move in one direction while shooting in another, and it's essential as you'll have stuff flying at you from 360 degrees.  In addition you can switch weapon types between \"organic\" (works best against smaller enemies) and \"mechanical\" (effective against larger ships and bosses) with the R-trigger.  You'll have to power them up evenly and use them effectively if you want to succeed.  There's also a secondary weapon which you can use to target specific enemies.  The four A-B-X-Y buttons serve as your special weapons and defenses, which recharge over time and change based on your weapon type and power-up level.  There's a lot to keep track of and it definitely takes some getting used to.  Thankfully, unlike most games of this type, you don't lose all of your upgrades when you die.\n\nI stumbled across this little gem by pure accident, never having seen it advertised or reviewed in any gaming magazines.

I also feel it enables me to rapid fire more easily.\n-Adjustable thumbstick tension has 28 different setting. They also have a nice rubberized feel that keeps good contact which reduces slippage.\n\nPossible Cons-\n\n-I noticed that the A,B,X,Y buttons will rattle a little when the Onza is at maximum rubble.\n -15 foot cord rather than wired?\n-The head phone jack is a 5m(?) which means headsets that use the 2-pronged won't work, neither does the chatpad.\n\nMy Experience - I've been testing and dialing in my Onza for the last week. It taken hours for me to get the stick tension the way I want it but now it's amazing (I have the Onza set to Sensitive mode). For example, I've been testing it on Combat Training (Black Ops) and I am able to track and pick off multiple guys running past - aiming and re-aiming quickly.\n\nI've been playing with FPSfreeks exclusively for 2+ years. I am able to aim faster and make finer adjustments with the Onza.\n\nIn Summary\n\nIMO - the Razer Onza \"Tournament Edition\" is amazing. I was going to try out the N-control Avenger but there is no way I'm going back to a stock controller.\n\nUpdate: 05/01/11\n\nI've noticed that one of the tension adjusters on my Onza's sticks is beginning to tighten or loosen on it's own.\n\nUpdate 05/10/11\n\nThe tension/rubberbands in the Onza TE's right thumbstick failed. My sights will randomly shutter and move left/right/up/down while playing Black Ops. I tried tightening them all the way - no effect.

As well as supports all the respective consoles original controllers if you wish.\n\nIt even has a region switch on the front panel so you could change it to play famicon games or super famicon games.\n\nI personally like the design of this I bought the white/blue one and it just looks sleek. The front panel cover the hides the controller ports is a really nice design feature.\n\nIt gives you two snes style controllers which match your color scheme. These hook into the genesis ports but will work on all three consoles. You cannot use an original snes controller on this and have it work with say the genesis games.  You would either have to use the supplied controllers or get a genesis controller.\n\nI can confirm that the super everdrive works with this. I do not own a genesis or Nintendo everdrive but am told those work with this as well.\n\nEvery game I have tested on this works. Even unsupported games like bible adventures I was pleasantly surprised work with this console.\n\nLastly I have hooked this to an hdtv that has composite inputs. This does not look as good as it would on an older crtv but it looks just as good as the original consoles would hooked to my tv and the sound has been just fine. I have heard others complain that the sound was not accurate. I have not experienced this and it could just be I do not have the affected games.\n\nNow the so so's\nFirstly the controllers. While these are by far the best clone console controllers I have ever used they are not as good as an original Nintendo or sega controller. For how much this thing costs though, these things are great and most will not have a problem.\n\nThe cartridge slots are really tight.  While this is good as it ensures your carts are making a good connection. Removing them or putting them in makes you feel like you're almost breaking this thing.\n\nLastly the console is very light and definitely feels cheap. But again I reference the price of this thing,  you can't really expect plastic quality to be the same as a current gen system.\n\nTo close this up for the under $60 price tag this thing is amazing. I have checked out retrons and this is better. The fact that it is cloned hardware not a system that runs emulators like the retron means you have much more compatibility. If you want the ability to play all those old games that have been sitting in your attic but don't want to go out and buy three consoles and take up that space you really can't do better than the super retro trio.", "summary": "You really can't beat this price for what you get.", "unixReviewTime": 1433548800}

Playing PC games with a console controller online Vs other players places you in a clear disadvantage.  I did not believe a disadvantage really existed until I was being very easily shot down in games such as The Division, Rainbow6.  WASD key buttons for movement never really felt right for me...  so I decided to go with the Tartarus.  The Thumbstick is not true anolog, so you will not recieve the smooth movement of a console thumbstick. Instead, you will hear and feel clicking due to its 8 directional points (which may be programed if not used for movement) . Nevertheless, the thumbstick is sensitive and allows for easy movement. The thumbstick also feels sturdy and well built, which leads me to believe it will be long lasting. The keys are not mechanical. The palm rest is adjustable to fit varying hand sizes... although individuals with really large hands (extra large gloves) look somewhere else. I wear large gloves and the gamepad is perfect for me at its full extension.  Connects with usb via a braided cable. RGB lighting with countless modes. Fits perfectly into a keyboard trey. Easy to map your custumizable keys.  More importantly to me- its does not take up a lot of space, especially when compared to the Logitech g13.

I went to buy this game and it's expensive but it's worth every penny. As soon as I got home I tore open the box and launched it in my brand new Pentium 4 Processor with cable modem. I was amazed at the graphics used in this game as soon as I saw the cutscene, but even more amazed when I saw the graphics while playing the game. You start out with nothing and must build an entire empire full with power, water, transportation, tourist attractions, and much more. This game is very fun once you build a small town and continue to make it into a huge city. I never built a big city because I couldn't figure out how to set the taxes right, I thought that was the most challenging part of the game. My land values were very high and I still got a little under the city budget. Anyway, SimCity3000 Unlimited leaves it's previous ancestors in dust because of it's strong graphical engine, hidden suprises, building architect tool where you can create your own buildings from scratch, internet option to share your creations with other mayors, and most important of all, the extordinary gameplay! So why did I give this four stars? Because it's slow once you get into a huge city. It took me about two minutes to move just one stroke of a key to view the city. Even on cable it runs slow. Well, I got the hang of the speed but after a while this game gets kind of boring, so I uninstalled it and sold it for the same price I bought it for, but I must say!

I mention this bit first because it is the game's biggest selling point... and because everything else in The Witcher is painfully flawed (even with the 1.2 patch installed). Let me put that out there again: EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE WITCHER IS PAINFULLY FLAWED. That's why this game is getting a 3 rating from me instead of a 5, and I'd go so far to say that, if I hadn't installed the patch, I'd have given the game a 1.5 at best.\n\nThe most frustrating thing I've found about The Witcher is that it is buggy. Prior to the patch, save games would often be destroyed for no apparent reason, so players would have to be extremely diligent in storing their data often and in multiple slots. Even after the patch, corruptions still occur - they just happen less frequently. As well, the game tends to crash during large fights (especially those preceded by cutscenes) - something that is EXTREMELY frustrating (and may have to do with the autosave feature).\n\nBut bugs are not the only failure in this game. The Witcher suffers from unoptimized code that runs poorly even on cutting-edge machines. The forced saving slows everything down, and load-times can be painfully slow. The graphics are decent, but not top-notch - they certainly aren't next-gen enough to be hogging the amount of resources that they do.\n\nWhat is coded tends to be poorly thought-out and executed. Combat is sluggish and, even though there are two modes, both feel clumsy (especially when trying the \"over the shoulder\" mode). Inventory management is painful, and the tavern vaults quickly become storage nightmares because players can not control how the locker is organized. Stereotypical RPG barrels abound, filled with unrealistic amounts of treasure and other items you'd think people would miss if you just took them - too bad they don't! ::sigh::\n\nThe only saving grace of this game is the interesting story that develops around The Witcher as he adventures. Your character, a sort of supernatural Van Helsing that has seemingly returned from the dead, travels the world making one-liners and battling monsters while his memory slowly returns (yes, the influence of Planescape: Torment is obvious). Where has this dark hero been, and what impact will his previous and current actions have on the world? While most of the story is fixed, some choices DO have consequences, and alter the plotline to a degree. This adds a lot of enjoyment to the game, drawing the player in and making him/her care about what is going on.\n\nConclusion: When it works, The Witcher is an extremely enjoyable RPG. Bugs, unoptimized code, and poor design choices diminish a lot of the games enjoyment, however. 3 Stars.", "summary": "Exciting story that is painfully programmed", "unixReviewTime": 1199232000}

Birchell", "reviewText": "We've finally reached the time where computer games have been around long enough that some of them are \"classics.\" This game, independent of its entertainment value, horror value or anything else, was so new and revolutionary that it belongs on the \"classics\" shelf for innovation alone. Its use of real actors in ghostly situations was an innovation. Its CD-ROM platform was an innovation, its use of video driver technology was innovative, etc...If nothing else, buy it and play it for its \"historical value.\"\n\nBesides, though, I think it's quite fun and entertaining. The horror still spooks me out: it doesn't have me shaking or fearing the dark, but its still creepy. (and, by the way, you can bet it was tremendously frightening when it first came out: it was the first time people were actually IMMERSED--personally involved--in the stuff of even the lightest horror flicks). I think the music is an excellent compliment to the game (although it makes some of the dialogue hard to hear). As a musician, I also find it fascinating on its own and the listen-only track on Disc 2 is worth a look-see. It highlights the game's atmosphere of being a horror of awkward weirdnesses rather than a horror of monsters etc.\n\nThe story is unveiled in an extremely non-sequential way, quite confusing. But if you accept the reality that these are \"hauntings\"--ghostly replays of the events of a previous night--then even that fits in nicely. And the final plot, once you piece it all together, is entertaining enough (not enough to make a movie out of on its own, but it serves its purpose of holding together the game.)\n\nThe puzzles are the clincher--brilliant. Varying levels of difficulty, mostly moderate, though. The game of exchanging four white bishops with four blacks is beyond me to this day--EXTREME difficulty--but the piano \"simon says\" game was easy enough that I conquered it on my first try. There is also an excellent mix of puzzle styles: chess puzzles, mazes, word games, image/slider puzzles, and even one puzzle that's not a puzzle at all, but rather a match-off battle against an adversary!\n\nI highly recommend it to anyone from the hardcore computer-gamer to those who just play from time to time for a little entertainment. You can save your game, so you can pick up wherever you left off.\n\nEnjoy!", "summary": "A Classic", "unixReviewTime": 1119484800}

It's open world, after a quick intro your character is left to discover and do pretty much whatever you want.  To me this feels exactly like GTA except not as much fun.\n2.  Heavily focussed on hacking through your smartphone.  Perhaps this changes later in the game or maybe I just didn't approach it correctly, but it really seemed to me that you have to use your smartphone for a lot of functions in the game.  I am generally not a \"phone person\", I use my phone for what I need but don't spend hours each day scrolling through FB and whatever other apps people are hooked on.  For me it is not what I choose to do with my free time, video games are... and this video game forces you to spend time on the characters smart phone.  It's difficult for me to identify why this bothered me, but I honestly just don't like it.\n3.  No \"hook\". The game begins with a mysterious phone call inviting the main character to some sort of underground hacker group.  It's clear early on that the group is targeting business people and your help is enlisted, but the enemy (at least early on) is generic.  If a game is not going to actively keep me engaged in action or plot then I need more motivation to seek it out than what this game provides.\n\nI fully acknowledge that this game may get much better as you get through some of these early missions, but to me there should be some excitement or challenge early on and leave the generic stuff for the middle of the game.\n\nI do appreciate the thought and work that went into re-creating San Fransisco in a good amount of detail and establishing new game mechanics based around technology, but despite the great setting I did not find this game to be fun or interesting.", "summary": "I was bored.", "unixReviewTime": 1488153600}

The instructions are in Japanese, but there are a few diagrams anyone can understand.  Really though, this controller is so simple you don't need instructions: you plug it into the bottom of a Wii remote where the Nunchuk usually connects, and it runs off of the remote's batteries.  Boom.  Setup complete.\n\nAs for the controller itself, it is nearly perfect.  It has a real solid feel without being too heavy and bulky.  The front is a glossy finish and the backside is matte with a bit of texture, ideal for keeping a good grip on the thing.  It is very comfortable to use, even for extended periods of time.\nSo what games can you use this on?  See below...\n\nOn the Wii U:\n- All NES, SNES, Game Boy Advance, N64 and (I think) DS virtual console games\n- Certain Wii U retail games (like Super Mario 3D World - see individual games themselves for controllers supported)\n- Certain Wii U digital games (like Shovel Knight - again, see individual games for supported controllers)\n\nOn the Wii:\n- All NES, SNES, and N64 Virtual Console games\n- Certain Wii retail games (like Super Smash Bros - again, check to see what games support what controllers)\n- Not sure about NeoGeo, TurboGrafix16, Genesis, etc. - I don't own any of those games\n\nSo, this controller can be used in a really wide variety of games.  The controller is designed to mimic the Nintendo controllers of old, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that retro games control very well on it.  N64 games are maybe a bit awkward since the old Z-button on the N64 controller seems to be mapped to the L-button on this controller, but it's not bad once you get used to it.  Even modern games feel really nice to control using this controller - very versatile.\n\nIt should be noted that you can also use the controller to navigate Wii U / Wii menus, so you never need to switch to the Gamepad or Wii remote to switch games or anything.  Quite convenient.\nAll in all, this is a great controller.  I've been using it with Super Metroid so far and it makes playing retro games a joy.

From the first screens (\"SEGA\" logo illuminated by the All Seeing Eye), the game is polished and well presented.  This is what games for the Wii should have looked like all along! I started off with the single player campaign (so as to appear to know what I am doing by the time I ventured online!), and the game starts off with some really well done story telling.  I won't spoil it for you, but I will say that the cut scenes and the plot that has revealed itself thus far reminds me of DeusEx combined with The X-Files... and that is a good thing!  Several reviewers have bashed this game for having a cliche storyline.. alien invasion... government cover up... one-man army.... but how can you hold that against a game?  I saw Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen last night... and guess what? Alien Invasion...Government cover up... same story!!  I am really enjoying the single player campaign so far, and find the story interesting and compelling.\n\nThere are going to be plenty of lengthy reviews for this game, so rather than rambling on, here ares some things I love about the game so far:\n\n**PRESENTATION: this game is PRETTY.  Lots of cool lighting effects, the enemies are alive and animated, everything looks really detailed.  One of my pet peeves for a game in the FPS genre is when your character's hands look weird (See my review for Quantum of Solace for Wii... Bonds hands look like 2 pig hooves!!)... but happily HVS did a wonderful job designing the characters hands, as well as the ASE.  The ASE is constantly in motion, and looks REALLY cool... I also really love the way they animated the various character deaths in the game.  It feels a lot like Half-Life 2 (my FAVORITE fps of all time), which is quite an achievement on the Wii!  Several reviewers have mentioned that the levels look \"bland\", and it is true... you will never get the wide open feeling that you get in games like Gears of War 2 on the 360/PS3... but this is, hands down, one of the best looking games on the Wii. In fact, the only game on the Wii that can even begin to compare with what I have seen so far on The Conduit is Metroid Prime 3.  And that, my friends, is quite a complement!!\n\n**DIFFICULTY/HARDCORE GAMEPLAY: I hate easy games.  I started the game off on \"Guarded\" difficulty, which I assume is Medium, and was pleased with the AI.  The controls took some getting used to, so initially I was getting my butt handed to me (by the second level you find yourself surrounded by LOTS of enemies), but once I got the controls and camera configured in a way that suits me (see \"Controls\" portion of review!), the tides began to turn!  One thing that I was glad to see was that the enemy AI is intelligent:  they would flank me at every opportunity.  I couldn't just crouch and shoot in one direction until all enemies were clear.  I tried that once, and out of nowhere: WHAM! I was hit from behind with one-hit melee that killed me! =)  Also, the AI is concerned/aware of it's mortality.  If an enemy is injured or is alone, it will run or seek cover rather than dumbly running at me, guns blazing. This makes for some interesting fire fights.  I will probably be ramping up the difficulty in the future... which brings to mind another nice feature: you can change the difficulty at any time for any level.  If I am playing through a level and find it too easy, I can pause the game and change the difficulty on the fly! Very nice.\n\n**CONTROL CUSTOMIZATION: One of the most outstanding features of The Conduit is that the controls, camera, etc are COMPLETELY customizable.  This is an awesome features, and all FPS really should follow suit.  After all, PC fps have been doing this for some time now.  Anyway, I was really impressed with this feature.  Typically, I don't change controls.  I hate \"that guy\", who whenever he comes over has to remap all of the controls.  That drives me nuts.  However, when I started The Conduit, I found that the camera turned a little fast for me, and the aiming reticule was a little too sensitive for my liking... so what the heck!?  I decided to try adjusting them.... and WOW.  In no time I found myself changing the bounding box size, adjusting my running speed, and making other miscellaneous changes.  This feature is wonderful, and also makes the game accessible for people new to the FPS genre.  If you find it too difficult to thrust the Wiimote to perform a melee attack... then remap the melee to a button press or something.  Simple.\n\n**ONLINE MULTIPLAYER: In a word? SUPERB.  The online multiplayer was lag free, and I found PLENTY of people online already on the day of The Conduit's release.  There are several modes to choose from... and the much-anticipated \"Bounty Hunter\" mode was my absolute fave.  The maps are surprisingly large, and the various multiplayer modes are tons of fun.  I haven't had a chance to try out WiiSpeak, but I am sure it will work wonderfully.  The online portion of this game is really steals the show.  This game is gonna have LONG legs... especially for people like me who are obsessed with ranking and scores.  You are given \"EX Points\" for kills/performance, and when you play online, your ranking is displayed when you are linking with other players.  I only had an hour or so to play online, but it was smooth, fun, and intense.  A+!!\n\nI really can't say enough good things about this game.  I knew it was gonna be good. But, having actually played it, the game is great.  This game makes it clear that 3rd party developers can really up their game on the Wii. No more shoddy ports.  No more mini games.  This game has really raised the bar for gaming on the Wii.  So, if you own a Wii, then The Conduit is a MUST BUY for 2 reasons:\n\n1 - The game is AWESOME. My new favorite game on The Wii.\n2 - Support QUALITY game development on the Wii!\n\nIn closing, here is how I rate the game:\n\n1- Presentation: 10/10\n2- Gameplay: 9/10\n3- Multiplayer/Online: 9/10 (would be 10/10 if they included LOCAL multiplayer)\n4- Sound/Cutscene animation: 9/10\n5- Replay value: 10/10\n\nDo yourself a favor: BUY IT!!!!", "summary": "The Conduit - Finally!

Combat is quicker which is welcome, but puts a strain on the series combat style of slow and focused emphasizing reaction based actions and greatly encourages a meta of quick weapons, again; removal of poise with hyper armor in it's place gives me flashbacks of Demon's Souls pvp, not a fan, personally, though this could be greatly compensated for with an increase in push-back on weapons. OST is pretty good, as usualy, From does a good job and getting great tracks for bosses. Sound in general seems like a step up as I feel genuinely limited if I can't hear the game, making it a pro/con on it's own as it limits my ability to listen to my loud music while playing. Animations are much smoother, taking after BB and DKS2 making actions feel more fluid, however this is hard to appreciate with such higher enemy density and enemy speed forcing me to roll away more often than not and thus not utilize a lot of the, subjectively, \"cooler\" moves and move sets.

You want to enjoy the moment...but the nose goblin just ruins it.\n\nThe booger in this case is technical issues, and unfortunately, they can make WAU unplayable at times.  This is largely because of lags, skipped frames, and stuttering movement during pretty much every aspect of the game.  Apparently it is a widespread problem if the internet is to be believed, and I tried it on two different Xboxes with the same result.  It's worst during the episode recaps at the beginning of each episode, and not a whole lot better during fight scenes.  The pauses, skips and delays make it nearly impossible to respond to the quick time event prompts.  Episode 3 and 4 seemed to smooth out a bit, but the 1st episode was so bad I almost gave up.  Those are the primary technical problems, but there was even one instance during a key scene where all the text switched to being in Spanish.  My Spanish is rusty, so I wasn't even certain what choices I was going to make.  And then it inexplicably switches back to English in the next scene.  I can't believe Telltale let this product ship in such a state.\n\nAnd all of that is a horrible shame, because WAU is an amazing game.  I played The Walking Dead on the PC before this, so I knew what to expect in terms of gameplay.  It's essentially an interactive novel, not unlike a Choose Your Own Adventure book.  This gameplay style may not be everyone's cup of tea, but just like the Walking Dead series, it is extremely well done.  This particular story takes place in an intriguing setting where storybook characters struggle to survive in the real world.  WAU has some very heavy themes and at times you have to make some hard choices.  Sometimes the emotional tug of war is a little uneven, but overall, it doesn't take long before you really care about what happens to the characters in the story.  My only nitpick is that while the voice actor for Bigby (the main character) was excellent, he didn't seem to be the best match for the role voice-wise.\n\nThis would easily be a 5 star game if it wasn't for the glitches and my hope is that Telltale fixes it soon.

It is a lot of fun to play, but the biggest advantages come from playing with other people. The campaign can be played with up to four people, however only two can play on a single system. You can play through the story with or without scoring allowing for playing for fun or more competitive play. The skulls that have been in the previous game have been improved to allow options making the campaign more difficult but also creating the possibility for a higher score.\n\nThe multiplayer aspect to the game is great too and also has been improved. Up to 4 people can play together on a single system, online or local/system link. If you have more people playing they do not need an xbox live gold account, but without one the can not play in ranked matches. Matchmaking is a new improvement to Halo 3. Instead of waiting in lobbies the game will match you up with people who want to play similar game types. You can always party up with people you find that you want to continue playing with. Also, if you have a party of friends you can play on custom games which allows you to play your choice of game types and completely change the options.\n\nThere is also two new modes, forge and theater. Theater is the simplest mode that allows you to play back your previous matches. While playing them you can create snapshots or movies of your favorite moments, then upload them to you [...] profile. Forge is great as well, because you can edit the layout of the maps and create your own custom game types. These edits can also be uploaded to bungie's website.\n\nThe final integration is that [...] website. It tracks all of your statistics and your rank. It allows you to compare your performance to that of your friends. Also all of the uploaded pictures and films of your friends can be downloaded. However, since the films are in game data they can only be viewed in the game. You can also download game modes. So if your friend made the \"most awesome game type ever!\" you can download it and play against them in it in custom games. The website allows you to queue up to eight items to download the next time you turn on the game. Pictures you can download right away and use on your computer. Its nice.\n\nSo, at first glance this might appear like a small update it is a pretty full package, even if you just buy the regular version of the game. It won't be hard to find people to play against in this game, and the formula that made Halo and Halo 2 is still there, with some improvements. Even if you didn't like Halo or Halo 2 I would still recommend trying this as it really fills out what was missing in those games. The combination of local and online play, the 4-player campaign, the campaign scoring, the forge level editor, the theater, and the file share are all new features that make this game stand out over pretty much any other game available.", "summary": "Great Game the you'll be playing for a long time!", "unixReviewTime": 1191456000}

With that in mind, does Super Smash Brother Brawl live up to the legacy that Melee represents, or to the level that pre-launch material indicated? Short answer for both: reasonably so.\n\nSuper Smash Brothers is a Nintendo crossover fighting game series featuring characters from almost every Nintendo franchise. Favorites like Mario, Link, Kirby and Samus duke it out in battles of up to four people on stages that are also taken from Nintendo series. Rather than direct combat, SSB focuses on the more cartoonish option of beating up an enemy and then launching them out of the stage with a powerful attack. Plenty of items and stage events keep the game an incredibly fun party experience.\n\nBrawl adds to the formula perfected in Melee by adding new characters, new items, and new stages, as well as some new features. There are a total of 26 characters; new additions to the cast include Pit from NES classic Kid Icarus, a Pokemon Trainer and three of his Pokemon, Pikmin's Captain Olimar, and the Mario series' villain/evil twin, Wario. Furthermore, two non-Nintendo characters are available, in a series first: Snake of Metal Gear fame and Sonic the Hedgehog both join the cast. In total, the cast additions include some pleasant surprises, but also some disappointing removals (characters like Roy and Mewtwo have been nixed, although they have been replaced with similar characters from newer installments of their respective series').\n\nThere are a bevy of new items in the game. Foremost among these is the Smash Ball; when attacked enough, it grants the attacking character a \"Final Smash\" - a devastating attack that varies between different characters. For example, Mario shoots a screen-wide barrage of fireballs, Link catches one opponent in a Triforce symbol and slashes away at them, and Kirby cooks all his enemies in a giant pot. Unfortunately, some Final Smashes are copied or reused; for example, one hidden Zelda character copies Link's Final Smash exactly, and every character from Star Fox (three in all) use the Landmaster Tank as their Final Smash. However, some are definitely really neat and welcome changes to the gameplay - a sort of temporary bonus minigame for whoever manages to get the Smash Ball.\n\nAnother new item is the Assist Trophy, which is similar to the Poke'ball item in that it summons an invincible helper to fight the enemies of whoever summoned them. For example, Samurai Goroh (from F-Zero) attacks enemies with a katana, as does Lyn from Fire Emblem (in a single swift cut). Kirby's friend Knuckle Joe delivers a barrage of blows and a mighty uppercut that KOs almost anything in its path. Little Mac from Punch-Out!! uses his speed and strength to deliver a startlingly fast jab. Jeff from Earthbound launches rockets at his enemies. Andross (in his Star Fox for the SNES incarnation) lurks in the background and shoots damaging 3d panels.  Not all of them have good effects, though; The Nintendog covers the screen, making seeing the battle almost impossible. Mr. Resetti from Animal Crossing goes on one of his famous rants, the text of which blocks the upper half of the battle completely. All of them contribute greatly to the chaos and hilarity of Smash Bros fighting.\n\nThere are some new stages as well. The famous Bridge of Eldin from the Legend of Zelda serves as a long, flat stage occasionally broken by a bomb planted by a rampaging Moblin rider. The Frigate Orpheon from Metroid Prime occasionally flips upside down, causing the playing field to shift. Smashville is an Animal Crossing-themed level, and like its source will change depending on what time the level is played. Pictochat has the enemies fighting among the doodles and illustrations of the DS' built in chat program. Most of the new stages are good, but some of them (particularly Delfino Plaza from Super Mario Sunshine and Lylat Cruise from Star Fox Assault) are simply platforms on a moving background, and lack any real extra themes or effects. It's also possible to build your own stages with a variety of parts and backgrounds, which is a fairly intuitive process that can produce some insanely fun results.\n\nBesides multiplayer, the game has a new single player mode as well: \"Subspace Emissary\", a story told through cutscenes and action stages. The former are well directed but unvoiced / unworded, relying heavily on body language to get their message across. The story involves an evil plot to destroy the world of Smash Brothers perpetuated by the game's villanous characters (Bowser, Wario, and so on). The Smash Bros cast must team up - splintered at first, but then united - to combat this menace. The interactions between characters have some real gems - for example, Lucas from Mother 3 using the Pokemon Trainer as a sort of big brother role model, or Diddy Kong dragging Fox and Falco off to help him rescue Donkey Kong. The story is difficult to make out, however (though it's explained in detail on the Smash Bros. site), and the final boss is nothing short of eye-roll material (hint: he's a new original character, not an established Nintendo character). The story is mostly enjoyable for the little tidbits, and those are good and plentiful, so they make it worth it.\n\nThe action stages are 2d side-scrolling classic platforming, with characters fighting against the mysterious and somewhat generic enemies unique to the game. The mechanics are similar to regular gameplay, but directed at a multitude of enemies rather than a small number of skilled opponents. Stages range from generic and boring to generic and frustrating - from \"random jungle\" to \"random ruins\" to \"random flying space-lab\". Other than the playable characters and some enemies from the Mario games, there's nothing \"Nintendo\" about the game mode - you feel like a Nintendo character playing in some other non-Smash Brothers game. So, in that way, this mode feels like it could've been done a lot better.\n\nOther bonus parts of the game include the return of trophies from Melee, new unlockable tracks for stages, and a variety of new event matches and sub-games. Furthermore - perhaps most importantly - the Wii allows SSBB to be played online, either with friends (added by inputting their unique code) or with strangers. This mode is pretty well coordinated, and there are no real complaints about it. The option also exists to spectate matches and bet on the winner, adding to the stylish, crowd-pleasing dynamic that the game entails.\n\nThe gameplay as a whole is great, but it feels less sharp than Melee; some moves feel too slow, unresponsive, or just \"wrong\". The sense of controlled chaos that Melee evoked has been replaced by rampant and uncontrolled chaos, and a lot of the \"art\" of playing has gone out of it. The graphics are in general improved, with some good details on characters and stages, but for the most part everything's moving too fast to notice it. The sound is mostly improved - any poor changes in, say, the announcer's voice, or quality in general are offset by the sheer number of music tracks in the game.\n\nAs a whole SSBB is a solid, fun, enjoyable game, with some minor bugs and annoyances. There's a lot added, but the jump from Super Smash Bros. to Melee feels stronger than the jump from Melee to Brawl. However, by itself it is a good game with a wide variety of characters and stages from every part of Nintendo's history.\n\n9/10.", "summary": "Solid, Fun, Enjoyable Game", "unixReviewTime": 1213660800}

The Xbox One controller feels much better than the 360 ergonomically, and I wanted to make the switch over when playing games such as Rocket League. In the meantime, Ive sufficed by plugging in via USB cable, but if I stream from my TV, its much more difficult.\nThe USB dongle is big, Im not gonna lie. The nice thing is that it is slim, so you won't have issues plugging in other USB devices next to it if they're in vertical parallel but its definitely long, and a little wide. Looks like an older USB wifi dongle. I had to remove my Logitech dongle to fit it into my laptop, where they are all horizontal in series. Note, there is a USB extender cable included in the box that you can use to prevent this issue. I would actually recommend using it, to prevent any potential interference from being plugged in close proximity to other devices. On my desktop, I was connected via USB 2.0, on my laptop I was connected via USB 3.0. I noticed no difference in performance, the dongle worked on both ports.\nAfter plugging the unit into my computer, the drivers installed automatically. I restarted for good measure, then pressed the sync buttons on my controller and the dongle simultaneously. White light flashes while searching, then goes solid after paired. Same went with my controller. You can do this to connect multiple devices. It does NOT disconnect currently connected devices, they remain paired.\nI tested using Rocket League (pretty much the only game Im going to be using right now), the device worked flawlessly without any issues for me. Moving to my laptop connected to my tv downstairs, I comfortably played again at a distance of ~15 feet from the dongle with no issues, either. Again, the laptop is running Windows 10.\nThe controller will automatically sleep after inactivity, just like a 360 controller. Merely press it and itll wake up and automatically connect to the dongle again, no problem. My computer makes a connection sound when it detects its woken up. Pressing on the home key with Steam running launches Big Picture mode.\nI have literally only owned this product for less than an hour, but so far everything is working swimmingly.\n I am using Windows 10, as it is a stated requirement for the dongle to work. So if you are using 7 or 8, be prepared for incompatibilities. I tested on my friends desktop running Windows 7, and the drivers would not install.\n I used an Xbox One controller (Titanfall edition)  I did try my 360 controller but it did not work, as was expected.\n Everything worked out of the box for me. After the driver installed, I did restart my computer before trying to use the controller.\n Controller works fine at least 15 feet away from the dongle. I did not try further yet.\n The dongle was not loose in the USB port, as another user commented. It does shift slightly, but theres no worry of it falling out or losing connection randomly.\nI will later test to see if this is compatible with my Steamlink, and update accordingly.\n\nI see lots of people disgruntled that it's only compatible with Windows 10, and that it's a surprise. Read the product description. It says it's only for Xbox One controllers and Windows 10. Seriously people, read!", "summary": "It works! Read the product description..", "unixReviewTime": 1445904000}

B&E is a lovely and wonderful action/adventure game that was release during the peak of the last generation: 2003. B&E's premise is something along these lines: You are Jade who is a caretaker of an orphanage on a futuristic (has a Star Wars feel to it) planet called Hillys. The Alpha Section are fighting a so called war against the alien invasion known as the Domz. Jade and her pig uncle Pey'j must find out the conspiracy behind the Alpha Section and the Domz in order to bring peace and freedom to the planet of Hillys. You take on a job as a reporter/spy for the IRIS Network and along the way you take pictures of animals, take part in speedboat races, and play a familiar air hockey game to earn pearls and credits (the game's two currencies) to find your way through the world.\n\nA lot of the game is setup around two game play elements; stealth and combat. While the stealth is stronger than the combat both are enjoyable and evenly balanced throughout the game. Sneaking around the two major parts of the game two take pictures of Alpha Section's activities is rewarding and easy to do. Crouching around corners and learning the guards patterns is a typical element in stealth, but the great part about the game is there's no jump button...yes this makes the game play a lot more smoothly and you actually know what to do. If you see a ledge Jade can hop up on you know to go there instead of hopping around like an idiot trying to, hopefully, find some collision detection glitch and get up onto that ledge. Sneaking around the guards is also like a puzzle in itself since you have to figure out a way to open certain doors, hit certain switches and even get items without anyone seeing you. The stealth isn't brutal and is pretty forgiving since if you run out of the area everything will calm down and go back to normal. Most guards have a weakness on their backs (a yellow jet pack) so this can blind them and makes things a little easier. Sneaking around the place is pretty typical and there's not much to describe, but it is very fun squeezing between walls and ducking in vents and what not. Thanks to no jump button dodging lasers is really fun since you have a run button and a dodge button so you just run and jump over lasers and obstacles and it can be really fun.\n\nThe combat, however, is a bit weak since it's so simple. You just mash the mouse button and Jade will beat the S out of everything with her magical staff; hold it down and you get a super charged spinning attack. While you can dodge and roll around while running the camera is one of the major flaws of the game and the combat can get so tedious and boring. Thankfully there isn't much fighting and you mainly just sneak around and do a lot of traveling. The only thing that keeps the combat from being a snooze fest is the unique way of having to kill certain enemies. Double H or Pey'j may be with you so you can order them to do their special attack and it will stun enemies or shoot them in the air. When they are in the air Jade with spin around and knock them across the room and this is good for taking out certain obstacles in your way.\n\nTraveling around the world can be fun and frustrating since the map is useless and the game is very labyrinthine. Since you're sneaking around everywhere you don't really remember where you've been so if you forget to take a certain picture you don't know where it was since the map is just a bunch of white blobs that don't tell you where to go. Finding things like animals, pearls, and other items is pointless since they are big dots on the this white useless map so hopefully you have enough pearls (used only at Mammago's Garage to upgrade your speedboat) to finish the game. Finding all of the animals can be almost impossible since a lot of them are in spots you never knew you could even access, so earning big money in the game is a bit hard and can make you go hunting for items you have know idea are there. This being the game's biggest flaw can easily be overlooked since you'll usually get just what you need by just playing normally. You can partake in four seperate races, but they are impossible to beat since there is no speed upgrade for your boat and playing flawlessly, using speed boosts, won't get you first place.\n\nThe races are seriously impossible even if you drive perfectly so this is just retarded. You can play air hockey at the Akuda Bar or a cups game which can be fun an challenging. There are items called MDiscs which you put in save machines to help evolve the story, increasing your health is done by finding PA1s, Kbup, and Starkos are food that give you health so you can see the game tries a lot of original things and is just a fresh world that has been overlooked by many many people. With the game's unique story, great voice acting, and wonderful yet simple gameplay design you're sure to spend a great number of hours on this short, yet sweet, adventure.\n\nPicking up the game for any system has it's ups and downs: The PC version's controls are kind of funky for this type of game, the PS2 has slowdown, the GameCube's controller requires a contortionist to play, and the Xbox version isn't backwards compatible on the 360 so take your pick. Either way you're going to have a blast with this wonderful yet overlooked game. Look forward to the anticipated game next year as well.", "summary": "A cult classic that every game should play", "unixReviewTime": 1332892800}

I've played several adventure games including Hotel Dusk, Trace Memory, Broken Sword, Time Hollow, Jake Hunter: Detective Chronicles, Theresia, and, of course, the magnificent Ace Attorney series.  Of course I picked up Lifesigns because I thought to myself \"Ah ha!  Another adventure game!  Now I can pretend to be a doctor without having any medical skills at all!  Huzzah!\".  First off, let me get the obvious question out of the way: have I played Trauma Center?  No I have not (and I wouldn't want to either; Trauma Center just doesn't sound like my cup of tea).  Neither did I pick up this game expecting it to be like Trauma Center; I was fully expecting an adventure game, not a surgery simulator.  Well, let's see what I got...\n\nGraphics (score 8/10): The graphics aren't bad.  They remind me of the Ace Attorney series in that you have semi-animated sprites and static backgrounds.  Bascially a ton of adventure games have this type of graphics.  Anyway, the graphics look good; the backgrounds are detailed and crisp-looking and the character portraits change facial expression enough that they look lively.  The characters are anime-style, which I like (but if you hate anime then you might want to steer clear).  During the surgical portions, the bodies look realistic enough without being gory at all.  So if you are the squeemish sort, no need to worry here.  However, Dr. Sawaii's hair freaks me out a bit...\n\nMusic (score 7/10): The music is decent enough.  It doesn't strike me as particularly good or bad really.  I guess I'd say it's just average.  The game designers did a good job of making sure there was enough musical variety so expect to hear more than just one track the whole time.  Oh, there're no voice overs but that's not unusual for a DS game.\n\nCharacters (score 6/10): Well, hmm...  I think this game fancies itself as a character-driven experience.  The only problem is that I feel that the characters are just not strong enough to succeed in this goal.  Poor Dr. Tendo is likable enough, but he doesn't have a particularly strong personality.  What about his coworkers?  Well, they are either as bland as he is or just plain annoying.  I wanted to strangle Aoshima sometimes.  Basically, this game is populated by anime stereotypes.  You've got the attractive older woman who's basically unattainable for poor Dr. Tendo, the annoyingly moody girl his own age, the uber-cheerful, sweet and helpful woman, etc.  Oh, and of course everyone is always trying to flirt with Dr. Tendo while he remains oddly oblivious (this really started to get on my nerves later on - why is Dr. Tendo so stupid!?!).  I swear after awhile this game was starting to feel like an episode of Tenchi Muyo.  Furthermore, while I realize that this is probably a Japanese culture thing, I started to get incredibly annoyed with all the constant apologizing and offering to help that went on.  For example, someone would say, \"can I help you with that?\" and the other person would say \"no, I've got it, it's fine\" and then the first person would say \"are you sure, I'd like to help\" and then the other person would say \"no really, I've got it\", then the first person would say \"oh sorry, I just wanted to be helpful\", etc.  This basically goes on forever.  It's not so bad until episode 3 and 4 where every other conversation is like this.  I felt like pulling my hair out!  Just let him help or he'll never shut up!  Sigh, I know it's cultural but after the fifteenth conversation like this, it really starts to get on one's nerves...  This issue really reflects a broader problem: there is too much contrived drama in this game.  Have you ever watched a really annoying romantic comedy where the characters constantly fight because of ridiculous misunderstandings that could be solved easily if anyone involved wasn't an idiot?  Well, that's what this game is like.  This is true especially in the third and fourth episode where it feels like the characters are constantly bickering to no real point or purpose.  Sigh...  In general, though, the real problem is that while these characters weren't as awful and dull as they could be (although some of them are very annoying), they didn't feel interesting enough.  If you are going to go the humorous route (and I felt this game was trying) then you had better go all the way with the wacky quirkiness.  Or, if the game is serious, then the characters need to have complex and compelling personalities that one can become attached to and empathize with.  As much as I hate to keep bringing this up, the Ace Attorney series managed to do both with smashing success.  As it is, the characters are not quite strong enough to carry this game.\n\nStory (score 6/10): Because adventure games are more dialogue-intensive and less action-focused  than other game genres, an adventure game needs one of two things to keep it compelling: either endearing, interesting characters or a strong, engrossing storyline.  Preferably both.  As I've already mentioned, the characters leave a bit to be desired.  Unfortunately, this game also lacks a cohesive narrative structure of any kind.  There really isn't much of an overarching plot to tie any of the events of this game together.  What the game does give you are a few semi-related medical cases to deal with, per episode, interspersed with endless amounts of office politics and dealing with coworkers (later you'll be dealing with the people you meet on vacation).  None of the little vignettes are particularly compelling enough that I could point to any Episode and say \"that's a really interesting story\", except maybe for Episode 5, which is quite good.  However, even though Episode 5 is quite good, if the story's taken that long to get good, then I feel that it's a \"fail\" in this category.  Having little character mini-stories/vignettes would've worked better if there was some kind of larger narrative within an episode to tie things together (the story is a bit more focused in Episode 5, which is why it's better than the others).  It's clear that this game is trying to be character-driven instead of narrative-driven, but as I mentioned earlier, the characters are just not strong enough to carry this game.\n\nGameplay (score 7/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  Well, the gameplay involves a lot of text - not really a surprise for this genre.  Those who wanted to spend most of their time in surgeries will be disappointed since the majority of your time is spent talking to people.  Thankfully, this doesn't bother me at all (at least, it wouldn't have bothered me if there had been some kind of compelling storyline).  Usually you just move from location to location talking to people to move the plot (such as it is) forward.  Occasionally, you'll need to use your collection of items in the medical record to convince someone to do something.  Other than those things, you'll be performing surgeries.  These are multi-step processes with gameplay such as moving your stylus in a wavy line to suture a wound or sliding your stylus in an exact spot to make an incision.  Don't worry, it's not too hard since you can hold down the L or R button to \"concentrate\" and see the line where you need to make that incision/suture/etc.  The surgery gameplay isn't too bad, but there are a few occasions where the game's detection of the correct area of action is actually off from the image on-screen.  I had to use an FAQ to figure out why my catheter kept puncturing the side of the blood vessel when I was nowhere near it.  Thankfully, such moments are not terribly common.  I also have a couple of other complaints.  Firstly, the text speed is a bit too slow for my liking.  You can speed it up by double-tapping the screen, but it would've been nice to have an option to set a text speed.  Also, if you are bothered by grammar problems, there are some typos here and there, but not enough to make it unintelligible.  I do have a positive note here: unlike many other adventure games, this game has several different endings, which is quite a nice addition.  If you aren't bored senseless by the story then you could conceivably get a lot of replay value out of this game.\n\nOverall (score 6/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  I can't really recommend this game.  On the one hand, it'll disappoint people looking for a good surgery sim since the main focus is on character interaction.  On the other hand, it'll disappoint adventure game fans since the characters and story are not quite strong enough to  hold one's interest.  I might've said that this game would appeal to medical students (it has a lot of medical jargon in it) but they'd be disappointed by the sparse number of actual surgeries performed.  I feel so bad for this game because it's so very close to being a good, fun adventure game with an anime flavor, but it just didn't quite make it.  Unfortunately Lifesigns is just a bit too dull  and mediocre to recommend to anyone - not when there are so many other fine adventure games available on the DS you could be playing instead.  In fact, I'd recommend any of the games I listed in my introduction over this one - so go play those instead.", "summary": "This Game Makes Me Glad I Don't Work In The Medical Profession...", "unixReviewTime": 1299974400}

Throughout that console's lifespan, TTT would be revisited and played more than any other game in my collection. It was smooth, easy for friends to pick up, and just plain fun. Many an hour in college was spent playing that game with friends, where we would make combos like \"Team Zoo\" (Roger and Kuma) and \"Geezer Patrol\" (Wang and Dr. Bosconovitch). Never did I imagine that it would take TWELVE years for a proper sequel to arrive. Hard to believe... but it was worth the wait. If you're a longtime fan of the series, and were disappointed by T4, T6, and SF X Tekken... this is the game you've been waiting for.\n\nFor longtime fans, this is the definitive Tekken experience. The graphics are bright, sharp, and colorful, displaying the wacky world of the Iron Fist Tournament in all its glorious weirdness. The roster of characters is staggering, and contains all favorites... it's hard to believe that every one of these characters has its own CGI ending (albeit a short one)!\n\nMost importantly, gameplay is TIGHT. The Tekken fighting formula has always been the best of all fighting series, in my opinion, with is relatively simple layout of left punch, right punch, left kick, and right kick. With those simple commands, there are hundreds of moves, combos, throws, reversals, and linkers for each character... I'm constantly surprised by seeing new moves that I didn't realize characters could do. The formula has been refined and tweaked to what I would call \"Tekken perfection\"... response time between button inputs and the character's response time is so fast, it's essentially telepathic. There is nothing sluggish or frustrating about trying to pull off moves, and even new players can pick up the smooth grace of fighters like Eddie and Lei in little time. And the commitment that Namco has displayed in showing such depth for so many different fighting styles is incredible- very few characters have a style that is similar to another. Some new elements have been added to the tag formula, encouraging more strategy, which will give this game even longer legs than its predecessor- which is a good thing, if it takes another 12 years for TTT3!\n\nPerhaps most impressive is the \"weight\" that this game has. When you land a punch, it feels like just that: you're landing a punch. Likewise, when you take a body shot from a heavy hitter like Bryan Fury, you almost want to involuntarily flinch (especially if you have the volume turned up). Add to this the hilarity of occasionally taking on the role of a kangaroo, bear, or dinosaur, and you have classic Tekken goodness!", "summary": "The King of The Iron Fist Tournament is back... and better than ever!", "unixReviewTime": 1347321600}

Breeding monsters is the name of the game here and you need to start planning early.  Basicly, you are trying to find something to plug up a hole in the island of GreatLog before it sinks.

The quest itself doesn't take much time, but even after it's over there's still much to do to prove yourself as the greatest monster trainer in GreatLog.  Many monsters can't be caught and have to be bred from other monsters and it's really hard to catch duplicates, so make your plans early. Catching monsters is done by feeding them meat until they become friendly.  Unfortunately, money and meat aren't easy to come by and there's no way to tell when you've given them enough. They also don't tell you the gender of the monster until you've caught it.  You can change the gender of an egg before hatching it, which is useful.  Saving is only allowed in towns and buildings (not dungeons) and in GreatLog, which is a pain.  When you breed monsters you get the egg, but the original monsters leave forever, so you can't get too attached.  One cool thing is that you don't usually choose which moves your monsters use in battle (in the colessium you can't at all). You have to trust your monsters to make the right decisions on their own and the more training they have, the better they do.  You also have to take their personalities and wildness levels into account when planning your battle strategy.

This is the prequel to all other Star Ocean games, and is supposed the last in the series. Which is a shame, I'm really enjoying this game, and I would've loved to see more done perhaps re-release of the entire franchise to the new consoles. In this Star Ocean the main character is Edge Maverick, I guess names were last on the list, who is a member of the SRF, and a part of the first humans involved space colonization on the heels of WWIII. The game has a very nice presentation to it, with a minimum of loading involved and for the most part the glitches aren't that horrible asides some slow downs and collision detection, but overall the game is very, very pretty. The musical score is great, with sweeping orchestral scores which adds to the epic feel of the game and brings some added tension to certain situations, which is needed in this game.\n\nAnd there is my one gripe to this game, while it does the whole JRPG thing right, and properly regurgitates an old story in a good way, there is a disconnect between the player and characters. I found myself not being interested in the least in the characters and their relationships. Mostly because this game doesn't create an evolving kinship between the characters like Tales of Vesperia did. It was a small thing to have the dialogue boxes pop up in Tales with little tid-bits about the characters, but it was effective in conveying that the characters all had a story. Star Ocean while having times where the characters have personal time, they just don't come off as likeable or interesting, making situations where the main character has that usual hissy fit not as poingant. Example, not a spoiler, Edge is responsible for the utter destruction of a planet, and while this is something that might make the character go nuts and really question their own motives, the whole scene was ruined by the fact that the main character isn't that interesting to begin with because no definitive backstory was done for Edge, so the fit he did have was greatly difused. I haven't felt any connection with the characters, well Bacchus is pretty fun. Star Ocean falls victim to annoying characters and really poor dialogue.\n\nPoor characters and dialogue aside, Star Ocean is still a great game, just on its face. The game does nothing wrong, and technically is strong, with pretty presentation, nice music, and some solid battle animations, and it has a lot do to in the game, with the trophies, yes trophies, not the PS3 variety, but in-game trophies on top of the achievements, lots of hording, item creation, the usual fetch quest that are well implemented. Overall, Star Ocean, is a great game, great in all the important parts except for characters and storyline. This game would've of gotten those two missing stars if more work was done the emmersion of the player in relation to creating likeable and vibrant characters and complex storyline, opting for a more heavy handed use of emotions, but hey I'm still enjoying this game, but more as a fan of role-playing games, this game will not interest anyone who isn't a fan of the genre or franchise.

After drying, the product immediately made my hands feel dry--with a slight tacky grip. Unfortunately, after having the product on my hands for 90-minutes, my palms began to itch and slightly break out. I do not have profusely sweaty hands, so this product worked for me (at least)--and it stopped my hands from feeling hot and moist. However, the slight irritation to my skin is concerning.\n\nUnfortunately I can't recommend this product, based on my own experience and use of it. It appears to do as it states, but at a cost of skin irritation & itching on my hands. Also, the price of this product is too much for only 1-ounce. I'd say use this product at your own risk.", "summary": "Dry Hands But With Skin Irritation!", "unixReviewTime": 1529193600}

None of the them hold a candle to the actual Arcade, but most of the home versions of the game have their own something that make them unique to the ones on other systems. Quite a lot of people who play this game put down the SNES version just because it did not include Bam Bam Bigelow or Yokozuna, however I still say next to the actual Arcade version, the SNES is the best all around with control responses and collision detection.\n\nThis version on PS1 is OK, however the collision detection is not that great when it comes to really fast pace controls, which is probably why this game is loved by those who play it, but interest in battling it out with experts just as good as themselves never really interested a great deal of players due to the collision of the PS1 programming, and PS1 being the most popular and easy version to find for home consoles.\n\nMany will try to argue that the PS1 version is the definitive home version of this game; but I beg to differ. It's only the most played version probably because it was on the most powerful system at the time. No home console could support the arcade engine, so of coarse the graphics would not be as good and many sounds and effects would have to be left out, so the PS1 being the bigger system compared to the SNES and Sega systems, of coarse it was going to be presumed it was the best version, the closest to the arcade. But I can tell you, it's actually not.\n\nSome things are only minor and probably shouldn't bother anyone, but it did bother me that the wrestlers entrance music or theme song does not play during the characters run to the next match, or during their final pose after you win the very last match. Instead their is a generic song playing, and like I said, it may not bother anyone else, but I like hearing those tunes, and the only way you hear them is during demo mode or if you lose, it plays the victors music during the next character selection. From memory, every other port of this game played the themes at the right time, so why was PS1's version programmed differently? That there is one up for the SNES version that everyone seems to put down, so far it already has better control and plays the music when it's supposed to.\n\nI've also noticed the PS version's fair factor when it comes to playing the AI is programmed to only really allow expert players to be able to beat the heavyweight division. Once you get to the Royal Rumble, no matter what difficulty it is on, it seems the computer is out to defeat you no matter what. Even for me I found it more difficult then any other version of this game... that may be something some gamers want, but to me, I thought it may play a key factor in come people playing this game and giving up on it, and not realizing the potential of how much fun you can have playing it. Shouldn't \"Very Easy\" mode make it very easy to clock the game for new comers or those not familiar with Mortal Kombat style executions?\n\nThese games are also very popular with people who love glitches in games. The SNES seems to be the best version to get them to happen, but the PS1 versions glitches aren't as exciting... I know it sounds crazy, it's not like the programmers did these things on purpose, but I know people into it will flock to the SNES or Sega versions to try and get glitches to occur. The ones on PS1 however make the game less fun in certain areas. On the SNES version it's not really know if it's better collision programming or glitches, but it's what makes it more fun when you go to execute a move on one opponent, get blocked or miss and it can still bounce off and execute the move on another opponent, or when running in a certain direction, you can execute your moves and they will attempt to head in an opponents direction. For example, Bret Harts \"Hart Attack\" or \"Running Bulldog\", on most other versions you can execute that move no matter which way you run, but on PS here, it seems to only work when facing an opponents. Whether that's a glitch or better programming, i'm not sure, but the lack of it on PS1 takes a bit of the fun factor out of playing as that character. Also simmilar things like that can happen when two players are about to execute a move, or one is in the air coming from the top rope, you felt like you could play Russian Roulette and something cool would end up happening like one move counters the other and someone ends up going down, but on the PS versions, I found all that really was achievable was a bulldog or hurricanranna from HBK to counter an air attack, as meant to be there. Also the type of glitches like sprites stuck in mid air and stuff, they aren't present on PS... again, I know, it's not like the programmed it to be able to do it, but the only glitch I can remember the PS doing was The Undertaker grabbed me from someone else and put me in a choke hold, where my character faced the wrong way, it then reversed it and it made the sound that plays when you reverse, but he just put me down and that was it. So, the glitch factor overall isn't as much fun with the PS version.\n\nOne thing I do like tho is this versions contains cheats you can input, and they are easy peazy to turn on and off. Code for invincibility, infinite combos, pretty much no AI and a couple of other things. That is one step up on the SNES version that I prefer, as it had 0 codes apart from random select.\n\nThere is also a move I love to do that is not programmed into this game. At first I thought it was a glitch on the SNES version, but I can execute the same move on the Arcade machine. It's a move Razor Ramon does where you tie-up with your opponent (F-F-Triangle), you then hold the down direction and tap square about 4 times then hit Trinagle and Razor will stop the multiple swiping, grab the opponents and do a pile driver that flies sky high into the air. It's a cool move to do, but it's not present on the PS version. Shame.\n\nOverall, it's still WM the Arcade, so it's a great game... it's just a shame it's collision, music and AI bring it down a few notches.\n\nEDIT: Oops, I take back what I said about Razor Ramon's missing Super Pile Driver move... it is in this game after all!

It's a lot like the Zoo Tycoon game, but there are a couple differences. The biggest difference for me is that when you sell animals to other zoos you can make some money off it. This doesn't work with all animals, because you don't make much off the common or easy to breed animals. However you can sell the rarer animals, like Pandas, for quite a shinny penny.\nAlso unlike Zoo Tycoon, the animals actually mate. So this title probably isn't great for young children.\n\nWildlife Park Tyccon is an English release of a German game called Wildlife Park III. So if you want to look for updates and patches, make sure you look for the right game.\n\nThe reason I gave this game only four stars is because the game slows down significantly after half an hour of play in any scenario. This is fine for the beginning scenarios because they don't take long, but for the longer scenarios this is quite a hassle. Sees to be an issue with how each of the visitors gets added to a log and the system can't keep up with the large number of people.\nExcept for the problem mentioned above, this game works just fine on Windows 7 machines.", "summary": "A great zoo tycoon like game", "unixReviewTime": 1358208000}

However the ffdshow codec may cause issues - you can fix this by telling ffdshow to not use its codecs for Fallout 3. Look here for step by step instructions:\n[...]\n4. Fallout 3 has issues with Vodei Multimedia Processor. If you have Vodei installed, it'll cause Fallout 3 to freeze ingame for a few seconds every thirty seconds or so. Vodei is malware as far as I can tell - get rid of it to fix your Fallout 3 freezing issues.\n\nGameplay\n---------\n1.

Walking from point to point really changes things as you'll find yourself getting worn out in multiple random encounters. It sounds undesirable but in realty this makes the game feel far more realistic and compelling. You're not super powered anymore.\n2. Of the five expansions, Broken Steel and Point Lookout are amazing. The Pitt and Mothership Zeta are decent. Operation Anchorage is really bad except for the first mission which is simply amazing. Unfortunately, the expansions have really good rewards which can reduce the fun of playing for a low level character (think of armor so good you'll never need another set - where's the fun in that?)

But the villain was pretty stupid.  He turned out to be some paranoid schizo nut case who wanted to kill everyone, which really made no sense.  AND, he sealed himself away in a protected vault where you couldn't get to him.\n\nHaving said that, I liked the scope and scale of the missions, and the fact that they were challenging, but it did seem odd that on some of the larger maps some of the areas where it seemed like you could explore, were sealed off or not rendered.  Example; the warehouse map; it seemed like you should have been able to get to the streets or swim around the rocks to get to the ship, but none such was the case.  There are other various examples.\n\nAnother minor criticism is the low poly count on the characters.  The skins help make up for the visuals, but I think an update is much needed to keep this game fresh and alive.  Regrettably Looking Glass closed its doors, so the probability of that every happening lies in the much vibrant editing community.\n\nIn short I didn't get quite the same sense of wonder or danger as I did with the first Thief game, but I still had fun with it all the same.  Garret had his usual bag of tricks, and the missions, though somewhat unusual, were still challenging.\n\nBut like I say, the villain?  Oh geeze, what a crock.  If he had some OTHER master plan, or perhaps needed to be more clever because I can't see the Hammer order going along with his mad scheme, then I might have bought into it.  Otherwise it was sort of like some of the middle books in the James Bond series; ho-hum, another megalomaniacal villain.  Next?\n\nStill, for all that, it's worth a purchase for the gameplay itself.

The item in the amazon is still the old box with red Grand Turismo 5 picture.\nThis I know that I'm getting new item for a GREAT AMAZON deal at 400$.\n\nYET!!!!! don't judge the book by its cover.\n\nThis new batch of T500RS is DEAD ON ARRIVAL. It doesn't want to finish the auto calibration. The wheel keep spinning to the left and to the right back and forth non stop. I updated the FIRMWARE and DRIVER from Thrustmaster.com and it still keep doing that non stop left right spinning unfinished auto calibration. I went to the forum, and found the suggested solution.\n\n[...]\npress Ctrl-F and search for non stop auto calibration loop in the link provided above.\n\nPlease note that\nToday is END OF 2015, and the forum link posted in the review is from 2006.\n\nit still does NOT fix the unfinished auto calibration phase. Seems like it's the same F-ing problems from that in 2006.\nmaybe the motor has some issue.\n\nCall amazon for replacement, and it confirmed that Amazon will send it and it will arrive by Dec 29, 2015.\nThrustmaster 1 stars.\nAmazon 5 stars plus plus.\n\nI will update the review. keep my finger crossed that the replacement item will not be defective. Because I KNOW that Thrustmaster makes a very good flight joystick A10 Warthog replica with a very high star ratings.\n\nSomehow, Thrustmaster needs to find a better manufacturer that makes the product for them.\n\nUpdate\n2015.12.25\n\nSo I put T500RS back into the box. Ready for the replacement, And play some other games.\n\nAnd several hours later, I feel antsy for die trying on the T500RS again. And set it up on my desk, and plug the USB back into my PC front side.\n\nAnd whalllaaaa... thing works like magic, auto calibration works normaly now.\n\nit makes me think what did I do wrong? because, I DID restart my PC right after firmware and driver update, but It didn't work back then.\n\nSo I guess it's just my luck. or maybe something related to the cache in my PC memory? I don't know. let's hope it doesn't break again tomorrow and many years after.\n\nStar increased to 4. NOT 5, it should have been plug and play without giving any trouble from the start.\n\nUpdate 2015.12.25 evening\nT500RS auto calibration gimme another trouble again. Back to non stop spinning left and right. I did the solution above by turning off and on then plug usb again.,This time it still doesn't work.\n\nhalf an hour later, I found second solution. How?\n\nPress the MODE button (the red or green LED located at the left bottom of the servo base). HOLD it, then plug the USB back into the PC. it works now.\n\nsigh... Thrustmaster!!! do something will you... 600$ item and NEW.... should be JUST plug and play, RIGHT? YOU HEAR ME?\n\nDoes it worth 4 stars at the price $400 Amazon deals? I don't think so... 3 Stars:\n(1 star for realistic feeling gameplay + 1 star JUST for the look + 1 star for Amazon deals = Total of 3 Stars)\n\nNEGATIVE 2 stars for giving me trouble and my wasted time for doing research in the forum and keep worrying if the product will fail again on me big time 3 months later just like those experienced by other T500RS owner in the Amazon review).\n\nPeople please give comment what do you think you would give ratings if you were in my position?", "summary": "Bad apples are plenty.

The game was amazing, with some of the best visuals of the time and intoxicating gameplay.  The series had gone to a first person perspective.  Nintendo defined as a First Person Adventure, and not a shooter.  Yet it worked for Metroid perfectly.  Metroid Prime 2: Echoes came out in 2004, and while it didn't match the flair of the first one, it was still a pretty good game in and of itself.  In 2007, however, the Metroid Prime Trilogy got an overhaul in controls.  The motion sensor controls actually worked really well with Metroid Prime 3.  Even then some of us were probably thinking, \"Wouldn't it be great to play the first two games like this?\"  And now Nintendo is letting us do just that.  You can now plow through all three Metroid Prime titles.  The entire trilogy is on one disc and they've got those added controls for those who enjoyed them in Metroid Prime 3.  It might bring into question as to whether or not it's worth it for those who played the previous two games.  That depends on if you want a different experience.  It's worth considering, though, because you're getting three games for the price of one.\n\nIf you've never played Metroid Prime before--any of them, then this is a good way to introduce yourself to the games.  There isn't a whole lot to discuss with Metroid Prime.  They're beautiful games that put a huge emphasis on exploring and adventure.  All three games do this while telling a story.  Story isn't really a strong point with Metroid, however.  Not nearly as much as exploring corridors, collecting upgrades, fighting colossal bosses and backtracking.\n\nThe Wii remote lets you play the first two games in the same manner you played the third.  Giving you the Wii Remote as your gun.  You'll move around using the analog stick and point, shoot and turn using the Wii Remote.  Metroid Prime works with these controls because there aren't exactly a million things to do, or a million different weapons to switch between.  Since just about everything stacks it can work well enough.  If you didn't like the controls of Metroid Prime 3, however, then you're probably not going to here.  It's essentially the same thing for every game now.  The controls on the Gamecube weren't clunky, but there is something smoother about using the Wii remote for certain tasks.\n\nThere are more than just controls added to the experience, though.  Metroid Prime 1 and 2 now have the same rewards system as Metroid Prime 3 had.  When you perform certain tasks or meet certain objectives, you'll get a credit which can be used to exchange for unlockable content.  More than that, the games also get a slight improvement in graphics, including a wide screen presentation and improving on some graphical textures.  The Metroid Prime games were beautiful enough on the Gamecube.  Essentially the games look just like their Gamecube counterparts, they just have a few smoother textures and a widescreen presentation.\n\nThe big question is whether or not to get this package if you already own the games.  That depends on whether or not you think playing with the motion sensor controls is worthwhile or not.  The control scheme in and of itself is actually quite good, but you're not getting a different game.  They're the same games you've played before.  Metroid Prime 3 is unchanged from what you originally got before.  This also means you might suffer from similar problems.  The motion sensor controls are good, but can sometimes be a bit sensitive.  Most people might have already experienced these controls before if they played Metroid Prime 3.  If you liked what you got, then yes, it's worth investing in this to use those controls with Metroid Prime 1 and 2.  In part because it's a good deal.  If you weren't a fan of Metroid Prime 3's control scheme, I can't imagine why you'd want to pick up this collection.  Even if you don't buy the collection, it might be worth checking out for those who are curious to experience Metroid Prime 1 and 2 in a new light.\n\nIn other ways it feels like a more definitive way to play Metroid Prime because the controls do work rather well.  It might not be a brand new experience for those who mastered the Gamecube titles, but it will certainly be different.  And getting three games for the price of one isn't so bad at all, either.", "summary": "The Definitive Way to Play Metroid", "unixReviewTime": 1251244800}

Turn-Based games were always my favorite and this is one of the better turn-based strategy games I have ever played.\n\nA lot has been said about this game, so I'll keep this simple. If you like turn-based strategy games set in space, like Master of Orion or it's ilk, then you need to check this game out.\n\nSome personal feelings about the game:\n\nWith the space ship maker, you get to build your own spaceships, with all the parts and extra pieces you want. This is a really fun part of the game. If you wanted to create ships that looks like the ones in Star Trek, you could. You get to create your own races as well. With the ability to create ships and races, you have a chance to create something really unique. I wish I could get this kind of thing in a fantasy setting.\n\nThere is no to little combat in this game. I know, you'll tell me that there is combat, but in reality there isn't any combat. Combat to me has to be something I have control over. I can't control my ships in combat, they fight how they want and who they want, with it all being automated. Mind you, I don't mind automated combat, I just prefer to be able to control my ships in combat, with the option of having it automated. Rather than some kind of tactics involved, it seems combat is just numbers behind the scenes.\n\nThe A.I. in this game is just fantastic. The diplomacy in this game is one of the best I've ever seen in a game. I always wanted to play a game like Civilization that had great diplomacy and A.I. in it, because that game always had terrible diplomacy implementation. There is a lot of depth when it comes to the A.I. and diplomacy.\n\nI do have a huge problem with this game however. In order to patch this game, you have to be online and connect to their servers. You can't patch this game with offline patches. It wasn't always like this. When I first got the game, I could patch the game with offline patches, but they now changed that. The reason why this is a problem, is because I have several older games and if these games used this patching system, I could never patch them today. All these companies are out of business and any support for them is long gone. So the chances of me being able to patch Galactic Civilizations in the future with it's great patches is slim. Because of this, makes me give the game a low score.\n\nOverall, the game itself is great and I would recommend it to everyone that likes these kinds of games if you can get past the patching system.", "summary": "Good Game - Bad Patching System", "unixReviewTime": 1228867200}

To win the tapes, you've got to board your way like a pro through different levels, trying to destroy certain objects, beat high scores, spell the word SKATE, and by finding a hiddin tape (obviously hiddin in the level).

How about the classic arcade games like Battlezone and Crystal Castles? They're all in this collection!\n\nThis is just an AMAZING deal - you get over 80 complete, original games in the pack. I am in my 30s and haven't played many of these games since I was a teenager. Yet when I jumped into the Adventure game, I immediately knew all the maps, where to find the keys, were the dragons would be lurking. Playing Yar's Revenge, I became hooked for quite a while, remembering all the techniques to win the game. Somehow my brain has been hard wired to remember these things, and it's really cool to go back to a game now and say \"Wow, I had TONS of fun with that!\"\n\nThere are even full scans of the manuals, so you can read each manual from cover to cover if you wish.\n\nIn addition to all the Atari console games, you also get the original arcade games like Battlezone. I was a HUGE battlezone fan, driving my tank around and seeking out the enemy. It is so much fun to be able to play it at home!\n\nIt is just astounding that they fit all these games onto one CD. I used to scrimp and save for weeks to get just one cartridge! I would have thought it was a miracle back then to be handed 80 of them in a box and told \"here, have fun\". I would have played for years on end.\n\nSure, the graphics are old-style. You get blocks of color without much detail. Even on a big screen TV, it's sometimes hard to figure out what the maps are telling you. But that is part of the charm, of course. Lunar Lander is just as much fun now as it was then. Hangman doesn't need good graphics, nor does chess. Those mind games are a challenge no matter what they look like.\n\nI really don't see a downside here. You pay one price for that CD and you literally could play for years. Each game is complete. There are games for every age group, for every gamer type. It really does prove that in the end, a great game isn't about sound or graphics. It's all about the design.\n\nA must buy!", "summary": "Amazingly Fun after All These Years", "unixReviewTime": 1110844800}

My 3DS doesn't get as much love as it should, but this game has now revitalized my love for the system. Immediately you will notice the graphics, especially how well the 3D effects are done. The colors are excellent, the greens, purples, and darker colors complement themselves quite well and make the characters pop off the screen. The gameplay controls very well, using a combination of the standard analog stick and physically moving the 3DS around for viewing around the mansion. The controls are smooth, and objects that you can interact with prompt with the button press for the correct input.  The thing I really like about this game is naturally shows the player what needs to be done, and how to do it in the early levels. This allows the player to immediately be in control of Luigi and all of the different moves that are required, without going through needless tutorials that most games have today. There are plenty of things to collect such as coins, gems, and power-ups to assist you in busting as many ghosts as possible!\n\nThe Fun-Factor is really where it is at with this game. You can interact with carpets, walls, drawers, ceiling fans, and just about anything else you can find in the mansion! Busting ghosts has never been more satisfying, at least since the original arcade game based on that famous 80's movie! There is definitely that feeling of other excellent video games, where you keep saying to yourself \"just one more level.\" There is a multiplayer mode too, so you and your friends can play some well-thought out mini games that are incredibly fun, and increase the replay value. The game comes with three save slots so you and a couple of friends can save your own file on the same cartridge.  The packaging comes standard with an instruction pamphlet and a Club Nintendo Points code. Overall this is one of the essential 3DS titles that any Nintendo 3DS owner should have in their collection!", "summary": "The Must Have 3DS Killer App!", "unixReviewTime": 1364947200}

Taunting like that happens throughout the whole game, which is possible to beat in as little as 5 short hours. Additionally, the game's visuals are horrible too, even though there are some Xbox-specific graphical features, the game runs extremely choppy. The biggest problem is the loading time, which adds up to the choppiness and makes it even worse. First, when the level is picked, it will take like a minute or even more to load. Then, there will be loads after every time the player advances to a new scene in the same level. And finally, there will be yet another load when the player quits to the main menu.\nThank God, that I did not buy this game. I hope nobody else does so either.

It's really easy for puzzle games to dip down into the category of mediocrity; after all, there are so many puzzle ideas that have been rehashed countless times. Yet, despite all that, Super Collapse! 3 actually manages to stay relatively fun and fresh. If you've ever played a click puzzle game online, then you've got a very good idea already how Super Collapse! 3 works. Blocks fill up on the bottom screen; when there's a group of three or more like-colored blocks, you can click it and it will disappear. The more blocks that you vanish with one tap, the more points you earn.\n\nBut the game play system is far deeper than just that. The puzzles, for the most part, are constantly growing. At the bottom, off of the feasible game screen, is a meter the width of the game screen. When the meter is full of blocks, those blocks will suddenly pop up on the bottom of your current stack, pushing the entire pile up one line. The rate of this meter varies depending on the puzzle that you're playing; sometimes the meter will fill up at a snail's pace, while at other times the meter will fill completely every time you tap the screen.

Whatever inspiration The Godfather movie may have provided mobster-game designers over the past decades, the boat for this genre sailed long ago, and The Godfather game seems like a desperate attempt to catch up. It plays like the counterparts it may have inspired, namely the GTA series and Mafia. The slight differences in game play are negligible for the most part, so the only thing the game has going for it is that it is the genuine article. In other words, the main reason to buy this game is if you are really into The Godfather movies; it offers nothing substantially different than any other game in the genre.\n\nThere is, however, one innovation that turns out to be a colossal failing of the interface, and that should NEVER be used again - AUTO-TARGETING. Let me explain how this \"works\":\n\nIn most shooter games, the player moves the cursor toward the target, then the cursor changes into a crosshairs or lights up etc. to indicate a good shot. If you want to lock onto a target, you may press a button or click a mouse key, but the player controls the aim. In The Godfather game, the interface SELECTS A TARGET FOR YOU when you click the mouse button. Try to imagine the horror of this. The computer inevitably picks the wrong target (civilians, dead bodies, non-hostile NPCs, concealed targets when wide open targets are available). CYCLING between targets simply DOES NOT WORK. You are more likely to reselect the same target you just dropped than another target you want. This leaves you in the awkward position of firing repeatedly at a non-target far away while being shot at close distance by the guy in front of you. Yes, you are given the ability to manually aim, but this doesn't work either. Your manual aim is done from (literally) the hip. This makes using cover pointless if you want to aim for yourself because although you point the cursor at the head of your enemy, you are unable to shoot over the box you are behind because it is at waist height! The use of cover and shooting around walls is very important because you have no body armor in the game, but the flakiness of the autotarget feature and the limitations of manual aiming makes this part of play very frustrating.\n\nThe developers totally wasted the Mature rating their game garnered. Yes there is \"intense violence\", but not gore: no amputations, decapitations, exploding or burned bodies, splatter, and barely any blood spray. In this regard, GTA has it beat. There is also no sex or drugs, just a few f-bombs here and there.\n\nAnd for God's sake will someone please turn that Godfather music off? Nope - can't be done. No skipping through most cut-scenes either so you may want to have something else ready to do while you sit through them.\n\nThe game is fun, but so is GTA. There is nothing particularly fresh here. The mobster genre is just exhausted, and introducing an old-classic doesn't revive it. Note that gameplay is beautifully stable and glitch free, kudos on that.", "summary": "It's only business...remember that if you feel ripped off by The Godfather game.", "unixReviewTime": 1143158400}

Enhanced in quite a few ways from the arcade version, and nothing's been cut.\n-Final Fight/Final Fight: Guy (SNES)-Probably my third favorite version.  A few things are altered and cut do to memory constraints (including the most dull level in the game, and one of the three characters).  Music is enhanced substantially over the arcade version, and overall I like this better than the arcade.\n\n-Final Fight One (GBA)-Now we get to why I think this one may even be better than the SegaCD release (at least as a single player game).  Visually it's very close to the other versions.  Better in some ways, though apparently a few light effects were cut that were in the SNES game.  The music isn't quite as good as the SNES release, but still vastly superior to the arcade one.\nBeyond being portable, the other big improvement is this version has the most single player content.  There are a decent number of unlockables that you get basically just for playing through the game.  Most significantly, Cody and Guy from the Street Fighter Alpha incarnations are fully playable characters with completely different art and somewhat different fighting styles-essentially giving this release 5 fully playable characters.", "summary": "Quite possibly the definitive version of Final Fight", "unixReviewTime": 1207526400}

Some Wii U games require wi mote and nunchuck usage but they are a seperate purchase.\n\nControling Link's swordplay using the Wii motion plus can be difficult as certain monsters early on are plants who alternate their weakness to either a vertial slice or a horizontal slash depeding on how they decide to attack. If struck correctly they will fall apart in gory fashion. There is also a species of pink moblins or whatever they are which are pink and wll block your atacks well enough with the flat end of their weapons.

NO, wait, flying is the most annoying as you control your giant bird with just the wii mote and the regular movement contorls on the nunchuck are not used.  Bottom line?

I have played WoW since it was first released and still playing it along with SWTOR.\n\nWhen I first heard about SWTOR I was excited because I had played KOTOR on Xbox and loved the story/rpg element.  Seeing that Bioware was doing SWTOR I knew I could expect the same thing with a great story telling element.\n\nFirst Impressions:\nLuckily I was able to play on the Beta server for a little bit and only got to level 10.  But im not normally good with change and was afraid I would get lost in the game functions/gameplay due to playing WoW for so long.  When starting to play it, it was very similar to how WoW is set up.  For example:  talent trees, quest helpers, map markers, action bars, almost the same color level for loot tiers (white, grey, green, blue, purple, etc.)  So the transition was easier then I thought it would be, which made the game enjoyable because I was familiar with the \"layout\" of it.\n\nGraphics:\nPeople might complain about the graphics not being all that great, but I can tell you right now, its 10x better then WoW.  I play on max settings and get anywhere from 50-70 FPS constantly.  AMD 6x Core, 16GB RAM, Dual Radeon HD 6870 cards (Crossfire).  Of course the graphics aren't amazing either if you compare it to Crysis, Modern Warfare, or Skyrim.  But graphics are good for a MMO.\n\nI have seen people complain about lag and FPS as well but have not run into any issues yet.  I'll admit I was a little bit dissapointed with the frame rate I was getting with the computer that I have (was hoping for at least 80 w/vsync off).  But of course, 30+ FPS for any game is pretty smooth.  So maybe there is a strain there and can be fixed in a future patch for people with less capable computers.\n\nGameplay:\nI can't comment much on end game content since I am not max level yet.  I just got this game 6 days ago and only level 33.  But level 33 is more then high enough to give input on the gameplay.  This game is obviously very story driven, since 90% of quests you get have voice animations and things are explained in detail.  With dialogue trees to \"pick what you want to say\" makes it engaging.  You can skip the dialogue by hitting \"space\" but I think that ruins the experience a little bit.\n\nAs for the actual quest, there even might be more cut scenes/coversations in which you can interact and make choices.  The best part is being able to make light side or dark side decisions, which affects your character and might add or lose affection from a companion.\n\nSince this is story driven, I know that could make or break a person from the game.  You might not have the patience to sit through everything.  Maybe, you don't want to invest your time listening.  From a leveling perspective I think you can expect about 25% cutscene story telling, while 75% is combat/questing.\n\nFrom being an WoW player, I actually lost patience to listen to everything and use the \"space\" to make conversation go faster.  To make up for it though, I turn on the subtitles and able to read what they say about twice as fast as they are saying it and its starting to save a little time.\n\nAs for the gameplay its fun and engaging.  Of course I find the fun in the cutscenes near the end of the quest or turning in, because that is where you get most of your dark/light side choices.  With those cutscenes, it doesn't make the game or leveling feel like a grind, it actually feels like a RPG.\n\nAs for end content, like I said I don't know much about it since I am not max level.  But I can tell you what I have heard from other people.  They say that the max level content is lacking since there is only one raid at the moment.  The people that power leveled to 50 are finding more time playing on alts then end game content right now.  Which is not a bad thing because every class story line is different.  Either way I am already looking forward to make an alt.\n\nPros/Cons:\n\nNow this is from my point of view, could be different for others of course.  Pros first:\n\n-Easy transition gamplay\n-Story based MMO which makes it feel like more of an RPG then WoW\n-Questing taken to a new level\n-Grouping up feature is nice as well, it makes things more interactive in between player.\n-Story lines are great and keeps your interest\n\nNow for the Cons:\n\n-Bugs.  I have ran into several bugs already, feels like the game was rushed out too soon for the holidays.  Some bugs from the interface to the actual dialogue optoins not showing up.  Something a patch should fix easily.\n-Monthly subscription\n-Lack of end game content so far\n-Class diversity.  So far being in the game, there are a ton of people that are playing a lightsaber class, but who wouldn't?  I probably would have done the same but realized everyone in my guild is a lightsaber class and I am the only Imperial Agent and are 2 bounty hunters so far out of 40 people.  I hope things balance out more in the future.  Just seeing this in the guild I can imagine how many mains are Jedi/Sith lightsaber classes.\n\nIn conclusion:\nTo start off, yes this can be considered a WoW clone to certain aspects of the game.  But what you need to understand, games will only get better based on what is successful.  Bioware has added their own great ideas to a base model of WoW.  Considering WoW is the most successful MMO in history, that is a good template to go off of.  Of course this does not feel like WoW at all, just the gameplay is a little similar but nothing can compare to the cut scenes and story telling.  Like I said in this review, the transition was easy because it was similar to WoW.\n\nI find this game very fun and addicting.  I was playing almost 10 hours a day on my days off.  From watching online reviews and discussions of this game, there are always improvements to be made but I can agree this is the best MMO out there on the market to date.  If you are not much of a MMO person, sadly enough I heard that this could almost be considered KOTOR 3 since it brings back the stories from KOTOR 1 and 2.\n\nSo even though this is a MMO, you can play it as a single person game just for the story.  Or you can group up with other people and take on other random quests together.  Either way, its a blast and I am sure you will have a good time.", "summary": "From WoW to SWTOR, This is Great!", "unixReviewTime": 1325548800}

Most reviews talk a whole lot about how hard the game is.  While this may certainly be true, the game doesn't have the kind of frustration that I normally experience in a game that others would call 'hard'.\n\nThis is an amazing third person action game with heavy RPG elements added in.  The initial character customization seems rather limited, but in a way that's what I love about the game.  Everything is rather straightforward and simple.  Items highlight in blue any features that are improved over your currently equipped gear, and leveling up just has you pick a category and gives specific explanations of exactly what will be changing and how it will change.\n\nThe combat is, quite frankly, brilliant.  Every weapon feels different, every spell seems to do what you want it to do, and generally when you die you don't feel like the game cheated you, but that you didn't follow the rules.\n\nThe online integration is fantastic.  Players can leave you messages that show up on the ground and give hints.  You can leave markers to be summoned into the game of other people and help them fight demons, or if you're an evil character you can invade the games of others and wreak havoc.  Leaving messages or helping others has good benefits for the person doing it, and I frankly love the fact that I don't have to talk to strangers online.  It adds a layer of mystery to these strange folks that enter your game, and eliminates the annoyance of having a 13 year old child throw racial epithets at you.\n\nNot everything is perfect.  You'll spend lots of time whittling down the life of a very tough boss by using really cheap tactics like staying just out of their awareness range and popping out every once and awhile to pop them with arrows or ranged magic attacks.  With the games brutal tactic of sending you back to the beginning of a level (upon death) with all the baddies back you'll wish there was a checkpoint feature just before bosses.  So typically you're so frightened of death when you get to a boss that you'll go the safe/cheap route in order to come out victorious.  This is kind of fixed by the ability to be summoned into the games of others and help them fight bosses (or to summon them into your game to get help.)  I found myself much more adventurous when I didn't have the threat of getting kicked back to the level entrance upon failure.\n\nThe long and the short is that if you enjoy Action RPGs, this is one of the best games out there.  You'll find yourself challenged yet hungry for more.  There are more secrets and special things to find in the game then I've ever seen before with the game encouraging you to play it more then once and to take more then just a single tactic.  It honestly amazes me that Sony contemplated not bringing this game to the US because they didn't think there would be interest.

Beautiful enviroment, landscapes, well-designed characters, different places and detailed textures for this plataform. The graphics are hot, I mean it! And you didn't even need graphics, this game would be great even without them. This game will be forever known because it has changed the world of games with such 3D graphics plus the lock-on camera, this game will be forever reminded because of that. Approved graphics.\n- Sound: This game has the best soundtrack ever, if you ask me... Nearly every song in this game wins a 10/10 score. I really want to find a soundtrack for this game, because both the Ocarina songs and the in-game songs are awesome. Characters don't have voices, except when they scream, when they're scared and this kind of thing, so the voice acting isn't great. But the sound wins a 9/10 because of the nearly perfect soundtrack.\n- Fun: This game touches you with a great story, great characters, great songs. You really feel as if you were Link in the beautiful land of Hyrule, and that makes the game so good that you can't say it's not fun. When you feel like the character, you just can't stop playing, even in the boring parts (in other words, the Water and Fire Temples).

I feel like the game has some scary parts (in other words, the cemitery and the Shadow Temple), so it should be rated T for Teen, even though it has no great violence, no red blood (just green blood sometimes).

When I get hit in the backfield while throwing it, the ball pops in the air always gets intercepted.  When I hit their QB it falls safely to the ground or my defense drops it.\n2.  The opposing I make a good read against he AI and I try to intercept the ball but its always dropped.  The AI makes a good read on my poor throw and it's easily intercepted.\n3.  I almost always get penalized 5-7 times a game and the opposing AI...never.  The penalties are much worse when you use the aggressive play calling options.  You litterally get called for chop blocking, face mask, and holding if you use aggressive options every play.  Ridiculous.\n4.  The screen is set up that especially if I am using the spread offense that I cannot see my wide receivers on the outside and can only see my slot receivers.  I have the pull the RT trigger to see them.  Even worse when the play starts I cant see the outter coverage or my receivers.  This is so annoying.  How the hell am I supposed to the see the corner blitz coming?????\n\nThings I really hate about the game:\n\n1. I really hate the fact that an outside pass rusher will cause my left or right tackle to glitch and turn backwards and cause an easy sack on me.  Are you kidding me???? Since when does a lineman turn his back on a pass rusher??  Why on earth would I recruit a 5 star lineman with 90+ pash protecting skills on pass strength, footwork, and pass block???  I recruited him so he could protect my blind spot next to perfection yet will allow more than 20 easy sacks on the year because of a screwed up AI glitch that makes him face the wrong way after the ball is snapped.\n\n2. Oh did I mention I cant see the field and the coverage when the ball snaps.  Yea, I hate this so much.\n3. How come by now we cannot create our own plays???\n4. How come since the 2008 version we cannot create our own play book?  Let's say the Missouri playbook has a Monster set that is pretty much all gimick plays.  I want to remove this play formation because it sucks!!!  It only has 4 plays in it anyways.  But I can't.  Seriously??  So I'm stuck with a completely useless formation that I would never use.\n\n5. How come I cant make my own defense?  I like to use the 3-3-5 stack but I cant get more coverage options in the 3-3-5.  I get a basic cover 1 press set in one of set of plays. But what if I want the set to look like a cover 2 with the robber saftey jumping in and out of coverage look like a 2 to confuse the coverage look to go into a cover 1 press when the play starts without having to audible.  In other words it was cover 1 press the whole way but had a cover 2 look.  With the 3-3-5 the extra db in this formation should be able to do these types of coverages and looks all the time.  This is ridiculous.\n\nWhat if I wanted my left saftey to look like press coverage on the right slot wideout but was actually designed to double the wideout on the left slot during the snap.  How come no outside line backer cross blitzes in 3-3-5 or stunts of the lineman with the outside line backer blitz to the outside.  How come I cannot do any of these things?  Yet my intelligence is insulted with these very lame and easily read plays.  Coverage is easy to read in this game.\n\n6. I like plays with option routes in the passing game.  But there are hardly any.\n\n7. BIG PET PEEVE.  How come I want to back shoulder throw a ball to my wideout in tight man coverage.  I'm pulling the stick as hard as I can to put it on his back shoulder and throwing it hard to his back shoulder but he doesnt turn to the ball or make adjustments to the pass.  He keeps running up the field and allows the cornerback to pick the ball off.  How come the wideout doesnt adjust to the throw.  The wideout did respond to back shoulder throw in 2008 but how come not now?\n\n8.  Another PET PEEVE.  How come the press coverage is so hard to deal with?  It really becomes who can press who better on defense.  I experimented.  I gave a guy (wide receiver) all 99 ratings and made for sure that he had 99 strength, 99 press release rating, route running, etc etc.  He couldn't get open off press coverage at all for 4-5 seconds at least 95% of the time.  For me to hold the ball for 4 seconds every time is unrealistic and ridiculous.  What was good is the 99 rating hands I had on this guy or else he'd be not effective at all. What was funny was any team I played could press me this way.  Interestingly the other DB had not near the ratings to do that kind of press coverage.  Why is this??\n\n9.  Why is most of the coverage in zone leaving the middle of the field open like a Tampa 2 coverage but not the flats and spaced between the safety and corner?  Maybe because you can only see the slot receivers??? and the game designers couldn't either so passing is easier over the middle??  If that's the case you need to fix all the problems I listed.\n\n10.  How come you took the spring drills out??  I loved that part of the game.\n\n11.  How come the better receivers with higher awareness don't sit down in the holes of zone coverage yet they just run their routes like mechanical robots and instead run the route behind the DB and make it not a good option to throw to him?\n\nEA should read your reviews.

This was Konami's answer to Capcom's Resident Evil, and still is one of the most popular horror games today. The game, unlike REsident Evil ,or many other horror games, chooses to scare you in a more mental, quiet sense (not to say resident evil is bad, I'm mearly saying SH and RE are very different form one another). The game is not for the faint of heart, or those with out a healthy ammount of patience, as the game focuses mainly on puzzle soving and exploration. although the graphics are dated by today's standards, this is easilly overlooked once you start playing. Although the game offers a fantasic story, and haunting atmosphere, I highly recomend Silent Hill 2 over the orrigional, as it has better controlls, smoother visuals, and an even better story. I have played many horror games, and believe me when I say that this one and it's sequels stand out amongst the rest, and shoud be added to any games collection. Silent hill is not a game to miss.", "summary": "hard to find... good to own", "unixReviewTime": 1093651200}

 well, young fighter, every set of colored squares has a corresponding triangle/small pyramid thing that, if destroyed, will take out whatever colored square they are on, well, all of that color.  but in order to destroy an invulnerable pyramid, you must pick it up and throw it on a space which does not have any color.  i think there is another way, but i can't remember.  or just pick the enemy up and throw them off.  this is also a good tactic, if your party can't reach a certain enemy, have one character (someone who can run really far) get to them, then throw them back to the rest of your gang for a good ol' beating.  this tactic is also helpful for bridging gaps in the map.  since the item world maps are randomly genereted, they can sometimes be impossible to traverse.  most of the time, you can toss you characters over the small gaps onto the other \"islands\" and beat your enemy silly.  while other times, some of these islands appear like 20 spaces away from where you are and you have no possible way of getting to them.  even the most agile of characters can only toss people like 7 or 8 spaces.  but that's not really too big a problem, unless your trying to kill off all the enemies on each floor for better spoils at the end of each ten floor section.  at these points you have the option of leaving the item world or further venturing into harder levels.  it's almost always wise to leave for more items and saving, but i can only warn you to do so.  some people will just have to learn from their mistakes.\nwell, this is dragging on enough, so i'll just say that this game is amazing and any fan of strategy rpgs should not be without this.  there is so much more to this game, but i'm beginning to develop a cramp in my fingers.  so i can't tell you about the secret unlockable character classes or different ways to make new items and super charge regular ones.  but i'm sure with time you can find all this out on your own.  so take my advice and go pick of this game, it's one hell of a time killer.  or is that social life killer?  i'm leaning toward the latter.", "summary": "best freakin' tactical rpg game ever!", "unixReviewTime": 1102291200}

The smaller scale that made me think this game would be \"dumbed down\" actually makes it more challenging because you have to really compete for resources.

After being completely overwhelmed by Morrowind, Oblivion, and Fallout 3, I gave up on finding one that didn't feel like I was spending what little time I had to play doing absolutely nothing.\n\nThe Witcher 3, while massive in size, is playable for me. The story starts solid and can quickly become tedious while trying to locate Ciri. However, the depth of the quests and the rich atmosphere makes it easy to forgive some of that tediousness. Many of the side quests offer great stories not found in other RPGs I've played (yes, I'm looking at you Square Enix).\n\nI am currently more than thirty hours into the game, focusing mostly on the main quest and some of the side quests and have not become bored or frustrated, which is rare for me. Also, I came into the series without playing the first two. I was lost at first but quickly absorbed details from past games through dialogue from the characters.\n\nIf you are looking for an open-world RPG that has a great story and hundreds of hours of gameplay and replayability, I highly recommend The Witcher 3.\n\nUpdate: Unfinished the main story last night. I logged more than forty hours of casual play and haven't finished every quest. There are also expansions that haven't come out yet. My point is there's plenty to do. Many games I've played require lots of time running around. Much of my travel was using fast travel and I still logged a lot of actual, enjoyable play time. The game's ending is heavily influenced by decisions made during side quests throughout the game. Unlike a game like Mad Effect 3, where every decision made doesn't really matter by the end because all options are open, The Witcher 3 endings are a little more fluid. And with the recently-released New Game+ mode there is some incentive to replay at higher difficulties.

Since I discovered that I was not going to be able to get this to conform to XBOX 360, I decided that at least I could use it on a smart phone, since this technology has the ability to mute the vocals on music, if you are getting a phone call. Vocal muting is an excellent feature if you to still want to listen to music,  when you just have to take that call.  However, the chat (mute?) button is on the adapter that clicks onto the XBOX ONE controller.  So when you bypass the controller to plug directly into the smart phone, apparently you are stuck in the MUTE position.  So the upshot, was that you could only listen to music muted, ie, without the vocals in the mix.  Also, the volume control, and multi-step bass boost, is also on the controller adapter, so you won't be able to use those functions, unless you are interfaced with an XBOX ONE controller.\n\nI admit that my experience with these headphones has been compromised, due to the inability to connect to an XBOX ONE.  Maybe it functions better on some smart phones than others.

The mere mention of the word evokes feelings of nostalgia in me. If the reader is unfamiliar with the series, it's a type of RPG in which you play a little boy that wants to these catch and train creatures called Pokemon. You train your Pokemon by battling them against other people who have Pokemon, and throughout the course of the game, you collect eight badges and go on to battle the Elite Four, the greatest Pokemon trainers of them all.\n\nPokemon Y is another game like what I just described. If you're looking for an innovative storyline or something, look elsewhere. That's not really what Pokemon is about. It's a game that's built around customization. There are many different types of Pokemon, and you can form your 'party' with any Pokemon you choose. Each individual Pokemon has the ability to learn different types of moves. The player is encouraged to build his or her party in whatever manner they see fit to try and win the game. I think that's why Pokemon is so successful. The customization is great in these games, and Pokemon Y is no exception.\n\nDespite that level of customization, Pokemon Y is just a little too linear in terms of where you can go and such. The pathway to the next town is always blocked off until you beat a certain Gym, talk to a certain person, or something like that. Since Pokemon lets you make plenty of choices throughout the game, it's really not as big of a deal as it might be in some other games. However, I'm still not a fan of NPCs popping up to block my path for no apparent reason.\n\nAlso, you now have this item called \"Experience Share' which shares the experience needed to level your Pokemon with all the Pokemon in your party. I turned it off from the start since I'd heard that using it makes your Pokemon too strong. Presumably because of that decision, I approached the end of the game with under-leveled Pokemon. It's actually really challenging if you choose to play it that way.\n\nAn important thing to mention is just how complicated this game can be. Physical and Special attacks aren't as clearly delineated as they used to be. For example, I had a Tentacruel with a Poison-type attack. In old school Pokemon, Poison attacks were physical and relied upon a given Pokemon's Attack stat. However, it appears that some 'physical' attacks now rely upon Special Attack stats. Then, you've got O-Powers and training stat bags. I don't claim to understand what is going on there. I think the stat bags improve your gains somehow and that the O-Powers are temporary. Back during Generation 1, I had Pokemon down to a science, but I don't really know how a lot of things work in Y. It would an interesting thing to study for younger players who probably have more time to analyze it all than I do. ;)I should add you don't really need to understand all of the specifics to win the game.\n\nFinally, you should know that the multiplayer options seem really good for Pokemon X and Y. Since TM moves can be taught to an infinite number of Pokemon now, you can try out a variety of different Pokemon and strategies with impunity. That's a luxury that didn't exist in the older games. You have to love that! It's true that these 'Mega Evolutions' tend to steal the show in multiplayer battles, but I think that's forgivable when you consider the larger experience.\n\nSo, yeah, Pokemon Y is a really good, really complex, 3DS game. Get it!", "summary": "I really enjoyed it.", "unixReviewTime": 1399075200}

I love the setting, I love the story, I love the characters and the voice acting, it's very believable. The scenery and the overall map design is fantastic, the intro to the game is stellar in setting up what you think will be an incredible experience but... that doesn't last very long.\n\nOnce you get through that intro segment and you first step foot into the open world gameplay and the actual game, only then do you get the taste of what the game is actually going to be and what the vast majority of this game is is taking over territories and you do that... for the entire game. The way you take over territories is as follows: step 1) you go and talk to a person who has a lead on the racket business going on in that specific territory. step 2) they tell you you need to find informants and interrogate them. step 3) you go the informant location, you kill a bunch of dudes and interrogate the one of them and he gives you leads into more locations of the racket which are either enforcers (which are just people you need to kill) and then just other locations where you need to destroy things to rack up damage money. Both of these involve just killing a bunch of dudes in a certain location. Once you reach a certain threshold of damages, you entice the racket boss to come out and then that spawns the racket boss mission which is the same as the enforcer mission (usually even in the same locations) and which also involve just going in a killing everybody there. step 4) once you take care of the boss, you now own that territory and can give it to one of your underbosses which in turn will give you certain perks.\n\nEach territory has two racket bosses and one big boss which is sometimes a unique mission, but most times it just involves going into a location and... you guessed it, killing everybody in sight and then congratulations!! After an hour or so of repetitive grinding, you have finally taken over a territory and can advance the story a little bit. What's next after that? Do it all over again!! Yep, that's right. There are 6 racket bosses/territories you need to take out to get to the main 3 bosses and each of those 6 racket bosses have two captains underneath each of them so you have to go through those above steps 12 times. Over and over and over and over again. You'll find that you'll be asking yourself, \"why am I still playing this?\" after the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th time of doing the same thing and that's the thing, the story is just good enough to keep you enticed to finish it so you succumb to this mind-numbing, repetitive, boring gameplay just to get to the next cutscene essentially (or you can just hop on YouTube and watch the cutscenes and save your sanity).\n\nAnd there's not much else in the game other than that. There are side/optional missions but they're the same repetitive nonsense that give you nothing in return for wasting your time other than a lame bronze Playstation trophy. Vito's missions involve killing somebody in a location full of dudes (just like the repetitive story missions), you gotta do this 5 times for Vito. Burke's missions involve stealing cars, not just one of each car, he needs 3 of each (including boats) and you have to do this, yep, 5 times. Cassandra's missions involve stealing guns, essentially the same as Burke's missions, also needs to be done 5 times. Why? Why was all this unnecessary padding added? I would have been fine with just the unique missions and having a really short game than have to go through 10-15 hours worth of padded grinding just to get to those unique missions and complete the game.\n\nLike I alluded to, there is a great foundation set for this game but they put almost no effort into coming up with fun missions that constantly having you do something new and different. But no, this game doesn't offer anything new, instead it just drills the same gameplay over and over again at you for no inherent reason other than to draw out the length of the game.\n\nI see a lot of people complaining about graphics, I think the graphics are fantastic (except for the sky and sun glare which is just ridiculous looking). I see people complaining about bugs, I didn't really run into any bugs myself. The only one I can think of is I had the perk which was supposed to keep my tires from getting blown out (which happens a lot in this game and it screws you over A LOT) but my tires were still blowing. The cops are very hard to get away from because all the cars in this game are excruciatingly slow except for a select few which are rare to find especially early in the game. The car handling is alright, almost too realistic (there's even a hyper realistic car handling option you can turn on which I really don't understand why you would because it's just going to make driving 10x more frustrating than it already is). Like I said, the cars are slow, they take forever to get speed. If you just take off full throttle from a stop, expect to do a burnout in place for a good 10 seconds before the car finally decides it wants to move forward, all the while you're getting bombarded with bullets and all 4 of your tires are getting blown out.\n\nThe majority of the game is driving from point A to point B and gunplay, pretty typical. The gunplay is good and the stealth aspect of the game is pretty good but it's nothing different from what I've already experienced in dozens of other 3rd person shooters.\n\nAnd the game takes place during the heart of segregation in America so there's a lot of racial violence and discrimination going on plus a lot of use of a certain racial slur which I don't mind, but I know a lot of people would. The game itself even places a trigger warning before you start because of this. The story itself is very straightforward. You play a black Vietnam veteran, Lincoln Clay, coming home after the war to only find out his family and friends are getting screwed over by the Italian mob one way and another and you sweep in to save the day and kill everybody in the mob. Typical vengeance plot but it's still good because the characters and voice acting is very well done. And the soundtrack is incredible, one of the best soundtracks in a game I've played in awhile. You've got Jimi Hendrix, Johnny Cash, Creedence Clearwater Rival, The Rolling Stones plus a bunch of other classics and unique renditions of classic songs. It's the perfect soundtrack to this game and the era. So to recap:\n\nPROS:\n1) Great story\n2) Great voice acting\n3) Phenomenal soundtrack\n4) Good characters\n5) Graphics/setting\n\nCONS:\n1) Painfully repetitive gameplay\n2) Frustrating car handling\n3) No variety to missions\n4) Long load times\n5) Texture pop-in especially when driving fast\n6) Generic AI\n7) Required grinding/padding of gameplay\n8) Not a very fun game to play\n\nOVERALL RATING: 2.5/5 (rounded up to 3/5).", "summary": "Taking 'rinse and repeat' to a whole new level", "unixReviewTime": 1476316800}

While Dragon Age: Origins and its expansion, Awakening, weren't bad games, Dragon Age II take everything that was good about them and doubles it.  Do you like dwarves, elves, and magic?  Do you like epic adventures with endless possibilities?  Do you like to completely customize your character in and out?  Then prepare for the decade long quest as Hawke and company set out on a grand adventure.\nThe game is narrated by a companion, Varric, a dwarf who likes to exaggerate in all aspects that play into his favor.  In the story he is being interrogated by a Templar on the events surrounding the character you play, Hawke, who has fled from his home to the state of Kirkwall.  While there are many more details it is impossible to do the game's rich back story and setting justice in such a limited space.  If you're a Middle-Earth fan and have run out of canonical and fan fiction alike, this may be the universe for you to sink your teeth into.\nFor those of you familiar with Bioware's space odyssey Mass Effect, the character customization is in the same likeness as is the revamped conversation system.  Unlike the first game the player's character is fully voiced which adds to the cinematic nature of this installment. The individual origin stories from the first game are removed to make room for this welcome addition. However, the same three basic classes are available: mage, warrior, and rogue.  If you had a favorite class from the first game it basically plays the same.  There are little nuances here or there but those that boast a revised combat system must see something that I do not.\nGraphically the game has been overhauled.  While it still doesn't look as good as Mass Effect it is still one of the better looking games of this generation, though the art style does take a bit to get used to.  It does appear to be much more colorful this time around with enhanced character models.  The frame rate almost never drops, even when my  party of four is unleashing an onslaught on as many as twenty enemies at a time.  The menus and user interface have been greatly streamlined for this entry though it is frustrating that everything but companion quests and side quests don't have waypoints.\nThe only two gripes about the game is the lack of customization for your party members and the repetitive nature of quests.  Though the player is free to customize their character, from skills to armor and weapons, they are rigidly limited in their party members.  The game retains the ability to move from party member to party member but this lack of customization (supposedly to keep the characters in character) is frustrated, especially when you have an ample amount of better equipment even early into the game.  As for the repetitive nature of quests their just...repetitive.  It appears that every quest will take you to a dungeon that you've already been to, just with different enemies.\nIs the game better than Dragon Age: Origins?  Without a doubt, no.  Even with the streamlined menus that led to the lack of \"NPC\" customization, the story, personal customization, and overall experience is better than the first.  It's not that the first game was bad, it was just scattered.  Hence, this game is only half (still 40+) as long.\nIs it better than Mass Effect 2?  Biasedly, no it is not.  I love Mass Effect through and through.  Perhaps it is my love of Star Wars over Lord of the Rings that comes into play.  However, it is Mass Effect's overarching storyline and gripping visuals that really keep that game in the forefront of Bioware's franchises.\nIs it better than The Elder Scroll IV: Obilvion?  Yes and no.  Oblivion, being released in 2006, is just old.  While Oblivion does allow for more intriguing side quests, the main story of Dragon Age II is much more entertaining , as are your companions.  However, both title feature repetitive dungeons.\nDragon Age II is a solid game that a fan of Bioware, RPGs or even action games should give a spin.  The improvements far outweigh the baggage the series is still carrying.  When Dragon Age III rolls around, the series should have matured enough to give the Elder Scrolls series a run for its money.  For now, it's a great time burner until the two aforementioned games are released.", "summary": "Dragon Aged", "unixReviewTime": 1366588800}

It was a game with an alarming vision of the future and a dark sense of humor.  Like other games built with that engine it played on an extended canvas with a complex plot that featured both linear and freeform components.  It wasn't my favorite game at the time, but there was enough challenge and originality to it that one could thoroughly enjoy it.\nThis new version, while it takes place in the same universe as the original, is a different game - really tuned to a different purpose.  The original was a classic action/adventure game, with considerable emphasis on the adventure.  Brotherhood of Steel is also an action/adventure game, but with far more emphasis on action.  The plot - what there is of it - is linear.  You are one of the Brotherhood of Steel, trying to join your fellow defenders of the good.  Somehow, this plot gets sidetracked, though, and you wind up in a classic dungeon drilldown to an ultimate boss.\nThe puzzles are a bit on the simple side, and few of the fights require exhorbitant amounts of thinking.  Get strong enough, get armor and a weapon, then kill, kill, kill.  Despite the game's rating of mature (mostly due to language) it is really less gruesome than many games rated lower.\nEven so, the game is enjoyable.  Brash characters with a lot of attitude make a difference from the standard fare, and the graphics and animation are good (if a bit repetitious).  There is about 24 total hours of play time and three different characters to play.  Since I've seen games lasting 6 hours that are less interesting and just as expensive I'm not sure I can even complain about the value.\nSo it's not quite like the old Fallout, a bit simpleminded, better than mediocre but not incredible.

Atlus continues to bring us some very cool games from Japan, and they have made many good choices in selecting titles, Summon Night: Swordcraft Story being one of them. It's about time this series made its way over to the North American region!\n\nThis is a neat little RPG that is quite fun, despite having its flaws. But first its good points. If anyone has ever played the \"Tales\" series (Tales of Phantasia, Tales of Destiny, etc.) then you may have an idea of how this game's battle system works. If not I will explain that it's real-time fighting, and you look at your character from the side (like you would in a 2D fighting game) rather than behind or overhead, and physical attacks and blocking are done with the A and B buttons. During the real time action, you can hold any number of weapons, but you can only bring 3 into battle, and you can switch between any 3 weapons you're holding (weapons can be elemental, so naturally you wouldn't want to use, say, a wind weapon against a wind monster) or have your Guardian Beast cast a spell or use an item for you that you choose with the shoulder buttons. Likewise, your Guardian Beast can only hold a limited amount of items or spells in battle, so you should set things up ahead of time. Once you're in battle you can't change the set-up. If you're really getting pounded on, calling up your Guardian Beast for a spell might get interrupted a few times. This is a pain, but it doesn't happen enough to be all that annoying. Battles, even major ones vs. a rival, or with bosses, aren't very long or drawn out, or even particularly difficult. All through the entire game it is just you and your summoned Guardian (monsters in this game are referred to as \"summons\"), and even though you interact with a LOT of other characters, you never actually fight side-by-side with any of them, only your monster buddy. You can chose between being male or female in the beginning, and customize your name as well as your Guardian Beast's name. I've only played the female one, so I'm not sure if there is anything majorly different in the story for chosing male, but I suspect any differences are probably minor. I'm not sure if gender effects what Guardian Beast you can choose, either. There are several you can get as your partner and I don't know if your character's gender has anything to do with that. Once you have your beast, s/he's with you for life.\n\nThe best aspect of the game is that the storyline is very involved, and the characters are interesting and more fleshed-out than most NPCs in RPGs. You actually will start to feel for them, and you will make many friends who join up to help as the story progresses. The story isn't complicated; you're the typical son or daughter of a dead hero, trying to live up to your father's name all the while discovering more and more about how he died, who was involved and what it was over. It begins to tie in with a mess of foul play that's going on in the present, so your adventure is multi-faceted. Yet because the characters are so interesting, it shouldn't matter much if the story is a little rehashed. For newer gamers they might not notice, but for old school RPGers it will be blatantly evident. But I'm an old schooler and it really didn't bother me that the story wasn't exactly new.\n\nOne of the focal points of the game is that you're a Craftknight-in-training on his or her way up the ranks, and as the game progresses you acquire more and more techniques. A technique allows you to manufacture your own weapons; you will get most of them from Master Bron, but you get a few special techniques in other ways. However, you can't just make a weapon out of thin air, so you must spend some time exploring and killing stray summons in order to collect items and ore to melt down for materials. Only when you have the technique and the required material can you forge a weapon in a furnace; you will use the one in your own quarters the most, but there are other places in the game where you're allowed to use a different furnace, although it does exactly the same thing as your own. You can even melt down old weapons for materials. There is a possibility your weapon can break in battle from use, but there is a meter that shows you if your weapon is near breaking point, and all you have to do is switch over to another weapon before the meter's gone. It only happened to me once, and from then on I just kept an eye on the gauge, but battles rarely last long enough to have to worry about it. Besides, all you have to do is forge a new one. The break meter is fully restored by your next battle.\n\nInstead of wandering around a map of the world, you are instead given free-reign to roam around the town you live in and the underground dungeon in order to collect experience, money, and materials. The dungeon is 50 levels deep (then an additional 50 levels open up after you complete the story), and THANKFULLY it is NOT randomly generated. You cannot blast through the whole thing in one shot, as the levels get progressively tougher, and at certain points you will be blocked so that you can't continue until you do a certain event. The game basically guides you wherever you need to go, but even if you forget, you can just push the Select button and you will be clued in as you character converses with his/her summon partner. In that sense, people who like to figure out what they must do next might find the game easy...I don't think I was ever at a loss where to go or what to do next. In between trigger events, you're free to do whatever or go wherever you want, but 90% of the time you're confined to your hometown and the dungeons beneath it. You must leave town at certain points via boat to travel to other towns, but to be honest, this activity is very minimal and restricted. While all this is happening you are also competing in official tournament (exam = battle vs. another Craftknight) to make rank. At some points you are given the option to pick your reactions, or who you want to talk to, and outcomes are different depending on what you choose (since I made a save and redid some parts, picking the alternate, just to see), but in general the story stays on track and the decisions you make seem only to effect small side-quests. More decisive to the ending is what people you choose to talk to when you go out for your occasional night walks. You are given a list of your friends and you can pick one (and only one) at that point to have a visit with. There are more than an adequate number of save points and health restore stations throughout the game, and you can easily enough find a warp point and return to your own room to rest and save as well. I think I died only twice during the whole game, and only once in the dungeon, and that's because I was careless. You can temporary-save anywhere in the game if you have to stop playing suddenly.\n\nNow for the bad points...my main complaint is that the random monsters (er, \"stray summons\" I mean) are rather lackluster. They're all basically the size of your character, although there are a few bigger ones, and only ONE large boss. In the beginning you run into a lot of those blob/slime-type monsters that show up in just about every RPG in existence, and then you run into yet more later on, that are tougher and merely a different color. In fact all the monsters have tougher, differently-colored counterparts, which is just a cheap way of making a \"different\" monster without having to design one. I believe there are 70 monsters in total...considering each monster has an alternately-colored higher level version, that's only 35 original designs. Battles involve 1 to 4 monsters of (typically) 2 different types. There are a few that fly, that you must jump to hit; nothing difficult. There are some monsters that are cool, like ghost armors and such, but random encounters come fast and furious, and after fighting 1000 of the same thing, you might feel more than a twinge of repetition. You acquire a \"bestiary\" type log that keeps track of what summons you have encountered, and I didn't even really bother looking at it all that much, only at the end to see how many I was missing. Which brings me to my 2nd complaint, the frequency of random battles. You barely take 10-15 steps and you get hit with a battle. The battles are fast and over quickly, but they can get annoying when you're trying to make some time getting through the dungeon, like if you want to just backtrack quickly to a teleporter. If you don't remember what a room was laid out like, you will probably feel frustration as the random battles constantly distract you from trying to figure out where to go and you end up backtracking by mistake. At least after the battle is over, your character will still be pointed in the direction he or she was heading. You CAN reduce the frequency of random monster encounters, for a certain amount of time, with an amulet item (one time use) you can buy at any time from a shop; however until you're higher level and have a bit of money, the item is expensive and you probably won't be able to afford more than one, if any at all. You can run from a battle fairly easily, but if you try to do it repeatedly, the random encounters become increasingly more frequent, so that trick only works for so long. And on the higher levels when you can afford the amulet, it barely seems to reduce the encounters at all.\n\nThe other thing that kind of sucks is that you can equip up to 3 weapons and ONE item to wear on your person, but nothing else. There is no armor or anything you can wear. There are various rings, bracelets and shoes you can wear that give some nice bonuses to your attributes, but you're only allowed to don one at a time. Just because you're wearing a ring, why can't you also put on a pair of shoes? Logically that doesn't make sense, but oh well. You can choose what techniques (spells) your summon buddy can use during battle...basically he has a certain amount of slots and those slots can be either items or spells or any combination, and he does collect quite a variety of abilities in time (leveling up along with you, but at his own pace), but it's a shame you can only take 4 of them into battle. I only used heal and 3 of the most powerful attack spells; I tried a few of the stat-enhancing spells, but they were a waste of time and proved pointless. No battle was lasting or difficult enough to warrant needing stat boosts. As long as you healed yourself and did a steady attack-attack-guard pattern, you had nothing to worry about at all.  The other thing that kind of bugged me was that you never have a party. I really like controlling NPCs, and while they ARE a detrimental part of the story, when you go into battle they're never there. There are times when you or your friends shout, \"ok! let's fight them together!\" and it goes into a battle that's just you vs. the enemy...I guess you are to assume that you're just seeing your part of the bigger fight going on.\n\nThe weapons you forge are of a great variety, and you can opt to use your favorite ones, but for the most part the elemental aspect didn't much come into play. There were only a few occasions where I found my weapon ineffective and needed to change because of element, and most of the time I used a sword. The sword is the most versatile as it does the most damage the fastest. There are other weapons that are faster, but don't do much damage, and other weapons that do more damage but are much slower, so there was never any NEED to use anything but the sword. There were only a few enemies that I didn't want to get to close to, and resorted to using the sluggish spear, for its extra reach. Why use an axe that does the same exact amount of damage as the sword, but only gets in one hit when the sword can do 2-3 hits before needing to guard? Why use knuckles or a rotor that are faster, but even if I do 5-6 hits before needing to guard, they only add up to what one hit of a sword would do? The weapon variety looked interesting, but in use, proved pointless. Some weapons improved other things, like defense, but only so minimally that it didn't make using that weapon worthwhile. The best line of attack was to simply use the best sword you could forge, most of the time, and keep your best spear on hand and then maybe an alternate sword or axe. Only once do you get a particularly powerful weapon (a special rotor) early on.\n\nBut here is my biggest complaint. The game was over for me at exactly the 24 hour mark, and I wasn't particularly in any hurry. That is way to short, for me. Depending on how much time you take messing around to collect stuff and level up, and forge weapons, you MIGHT stretch it out to 26 or 27 hours . Personally I like RPGs to last around 40 hours, and I like being challenged with puzzles, having vast areas to explore, and really needing to contemplate what I need to do next. It is not just a hack-n-slash dungeon crawler, but it's no puzzler, either. If you liked Golden Sun, this game would be disappointing. There are some hidden treasures but no puzzle-solving to do, and everything is basically very obvious. As long as you level up properly, you will not have any problems with monsters or stadium battles. Getting the opportunity to go somewhere else besides your hometown and the dungeon underneath did not happen frequently enough. You do get to borrow your master's boat a few times to run some errands, but you are never allowed to just go out and explore anywhere. The short trips to other towns are just that: short trips, and once you accomplish your \"mission,\" (usually just delivering some weapons to a shop) it's over and you have to return home. Your hometown isn't all that interesting, either. Most buildings are just homes, there aren't that many of them, they're not all populated, and the townspeople haven't got much to say. In addition, there is nothing to look at or discover. You can't open any chests or barrels (only the ones in the dungeon) so there's really no point venturing into homes anyhow, there are no items to be found. Some of the things people say change after some events, but they are not detrimental to the story. In the few cases that they are, you are told where to go and who to talk to.\n\nRegardless, I still had fun playing the game, and I did want to see it to the end. There are 2 save slots, and 2 (slightly) different endings, so it's best to alternate between save slots just in case you want to go back and make a different decision to see the other outcome. The \"bad decision\" ending is considerably shorter than the \"good decision\" one, and you might not realize which one to pick at first, so save carefully. Once the game is over and you have achieved the highest status you can get, 50 more levels open up to explore in the dungeon, so you can work on collecting a few more techniques, equippable items, and filling out the rest of your bestiary. In fact that's when you get all the best stuff. So it has a bit of potential even after the story is finished, plus you can always replay it as the opposite gender to see any differences.", "summary": "Flawed, But Totally Worth Getting", "unixReviewTime": 1165708800}

So, it's not like I went into this game with blinders on.  And despite making absolutely no sense whatsoever, I managed to drudge through several chapters of this game, including the ridiculous \"gigolo miigames\".  I probably didn't even get 50% through this game before calling it quits.  It's just too stupid!  The protagonist, who is supposed to be a bad*ss assassin, is named Mondo Zappa...what?  You have an \"assistant\" in the game that has a personality and voice that is absurdly annoying.  The music in this game is like something out of a 1970s adult film.  Sure, there is some decent hack and slash swordplay and a nice sub-weapon that is your robotic arm, but the positives end there.  The enemies that you battle are, well, I don't even know!  What are these things I'm fighting and why am I fighting them?  Some of them are very weak, some of them have blocking techniques that you must break in order to damage them, etc., but you really don't know what they are.  Are they robots?  Some sort of demons?  Moon people?  Who knows?\n\nThen there are the gigolo minigames.  They are completely optional, however, if you don't play them, you won't be able to upgrade to better weapons, etc.  So, if you want to optimize Mondo Zappa, you really do have to play them.  These minigames are also effing dumb.  The object of them is to stare at a woman's cleavage without her catching you, and giving her gifts.  Gifts that you must purchase.  Gifts that range from a stick of gum to jewelry.

I can't see the game being any good in 3D without being like DMC. Other than that, its Castlevania. You use a whip to perform many combos and subweapons to defeat enemies.

It's a fantastic platforming-action game and one that is, in almost every possible way, a true celebration of the Blue Blur that any self-respecting Sonic fan should love. The 3DS version is no different. It's gotten a surprising amount of flak, though, and honestly, I don't feel the common complaints reflect honestly and fairly on this awesome title. I'll admit, this version of Sonic Generations is very difficult for me to objectively rate. I have a lot of nitpicky thoughts about it that aren't technically flaws or complaints, but rather questions due to confusion at some design choices that went into making this game. Still, even though some things about this title confound me, I cannot deny that it is just as enjoyable to play through as the console version. It's just different.\n\nAny Sonic fan knows immediately what Sonic Generations is about. It's essentially a title that is meant to celebrate Sonic's 20th year anniversary by presenting a simple plot involving a universe/time paradox mechanic that makes it possible for us to revisit some of the more famous levels from Sonic's history. While the story may not be particularly deep or anything, the writing is fantastic, with tons of charm and humor that is genuinely well done. The plot in the 3DS version, however, is a lot more convoluted and confusing to follow because the snazzy cutscenes of the console version have been done away with in favor of idle, gesturing 3D model talking heads, much like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/DS-Sonic-Colors/dp/B002I0EPP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">DS Sonic Colors</a>&nbsp;did. Overall though, I felt the presentation and development of the story in the 3DS version would only be understandable to those who are already very familiar with the console version. Who cares though? Sonic has always been about awesome, fast-as-sound platforming through brilliantly imaginative environments with a stellar soundtrack in the background, and that's where this game really shines.\n\nThere are two different versions of each level too, one for \"Classic Sonic\" and one for \"Modern Sonic.\" Classic Sonic's levels play exactly like the old Genesis titles, with the same kind of level design and, thankfully, the same classical physics system that we all know and love. I must say, Sonic Team nailed the Classic Sonic gameplay in every version of this game. In fact, I think the 3DS version feels even more like the classics than the console version does, because everything in the 3DS classic levels is at the same scale as the classics too. In the console Generations, classic Sonic's levels were bigger in scope and even faster than the Genesis titles ever were, but in the 3DS version, it truly feels like this is just new graphics and sound overlayed on top of the old gameplay engine. It really is fantastic.\n\nModern Sonic's gameplay is very similar to the modern portable Sonic titles, such as Rush or Colors on the DS, so it's still 2-D, bizarrely enough. In addition to running and jumping, however, you'll also be homing attacking enemies (although Classic Sonic gets that ability later in the game too), grinding, boosting, and sliding throughout the adrenaline-pumping stages that seem to send you in every which way. Paths will take you to the foreground, the background, and everywhere in between, giving the gameplay a 3-D sense of scale, and I feel it really lends a feeling of organic life to what would normally be a 2-D \"flatformer.\" Trust me, nothing about this game is \"flat\" or \"lifeless.\" Overall, Modern Sonic's levels are characterized by an over the top craziness that saturates the whole experience. It's really awesome.\n\nThe audio and visual work done to bring the classic levels into the year 2011 is amazing. The 3DS version is essentially like a portable Gamecube, in terms of graphical power, and it really looks snazzy on that small screen. Some complain that the screen is too small to keep track of Sonic or the gameplay taking place, but I disagree, I had no problems as I played the game. The game is so colorful and capatilizes so well on the art design of all of the Sonic titles represented here, and the 3-D visual effect of the game was implemented excellently. The same goes for the music, which is also amazing. Obviously the source material for the songs were brilliant to begin with, but the remixes in here are almost all simply fantastic. Overall, the visual/audio aspect of this game is just great, and as a lifetime Sonic fan, I was overcome with nostalgic joy the entire time I played this game.\n\nNow, here is where I'll voice my confusion about the game. It may be ranty/rambly, so I apologize ahead of time. First off, special stages make a return in this game, and each one is amazingly fun. It's basically a blatant copy of the special stages from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sonic-Heroes/dp/B0000VSH4U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sonic Heroes</a>. It's 3-D, and it works very well, so... Why wasn't Modern Sonic's gameplay 3-D?! It's obvious from the special stage that the 3DS version was more than capable of 3-D gameplay. What gives? In all honestly, the Modern Sonic gameplay in this version feels more like the 2-D segments in the console version of Generations, or the 2-D segments in&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sonic-Colors-the-Wii-version/dp/B002I0IIPY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sonic Colors (the Wii version)</a>, than it does the handheld modern titles, if that makes sense. I don't get it. I think it would have been a real benefit, and made a big difference in adding to variety, to make Modern Sonic play like he does in the console version. This is a big oversight, in my opinion.\n\nThe game is also shorter than the console version, by two stages. Granted, besides Green Hill Zone, every level in this version is unique and different, which is great. Same goes for the boss fights, for the most part. In many ways, this 3DS version feels like a DLC expansion pack to supplement the console version with six new levels and three new boss fights. I don't say that as a complaint, as I think more Sonic history being given the Generations treatment is a superb thing indeed. Unfortunately, the game is far too short. I beat it in a mere 2 1/2 hours, with all chaos emeralds in my possession and the final fourth boss beaten. I beat Sonic 4 Episode 1 in the same amount of time, but I spent $10 on that game, not $30 like this one, so I must complain about the small content volume.\n\nFinally, one last area of the game that is slightly confusing is the level choice. Obviously, for the classical era, Genesis games were selected. That makes sense. Then for the second \"era\" of Sonic, levels from his Dreamcast masterpieces were chosen. Again, it makes sense, I suppose. Then, for the last \"era,\" one level was selected from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sonic-Rush/dp/B0009SQFHK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sonic Rush</a>, and the other from Colors. What? Rush is the only portable game included here. I guess Colors was also on the DS and so there's technically two handheld games represented, but still, that just adds more confusion. I don't understand why only the third \"era\" has any portable games in it. There are tons of awesome level possibilities from Sonic's portable history to make this version of Generations unique as a salute to Sonic's handheld gaming past. The GBA's \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sonic-Advance/dp/B00005MO5G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sonic Advance</a>\" series is a great example of this. Frankly,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sonic-Advance/dp/B00005MO5G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sonic Advance</a>&nbsp;is brilliant, and I personally consider it the true \"Sonic the Hedgehog 4,\"&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sonic-Advance-2/dp/B00008DHNU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sonic Advance 2</a>&nbsp;is awesome as well. TONS of potential in those titles for Generations. If the inclusion of \"Water Palace\" and \"Tropical Resort\" indicates that this is a \"Portable Sonic game\" version of Generations, why isn't the Advance series featured instead of the Dreamcast titles since they were released at roughly the same time? And how about some of the fantastic Game Gear entries instead of Genesis games? How awesome would&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Bridge-Zone/dp/B00004R9GA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bridge Zone</a>&nbsp;have been instead of Green Hill for this version? I genuinely don't get it. A handheld themed Sonic Generations would have been incredibly unique. Oh well. That's the end of my rant, sorry if it went on too long.\n\nAll-in-all, however, this is still a stellar Sonic title. I think the reason it's gotten all the flak it has is that for years, handheld Sonic titles were always expected to be vastly superior games to the console titles. When the console version of Generations released and blew most gamers' minds, expectations for this handheld version skyrocketed. Frankly, I don't think this 3DS release is worse than the console one. Honestly, they're equal quality in terms of gameplay, but the console version is simply more complete, more coherent, and has more content in it, and that was enough to get this version an unfair reputation. I highly recommend it, though, if you want more of the wonderful experiences that the console version had. It's still a fantastic title. So buy it, enjoy the stellar \"fasting thing alive\" platforming, and blast through even more nostalgic Sonic wonderment.", "summary": "A great expansion to the stellar console version experience", "unixReviewTime": 1336176000}

{"overall": 4.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "07 23, 2013", "reviewerID": "A3E7YWI8VV7VCV", "asin": "B008B2VOEK", "reviewerName": "Hrafnkell Haraldsson", "reviewText": "World of Tanks pits teams of players driving tanks from different countries against each other in various types of battles across a wide array of terrain. There is the steppe, the desert, an arctic setting, Prokhorovka in Russia, and numerous others. Each team is composed of 15 tanks. You will find yourself fighting alongside Russian, German, Chinese, British, French, and American tanks against a similar assortment of enemies. The first side to capture the other's base (called the CAP) or to destroy all their enemies, wins the battle. If neither team can win in the ten-minute time period, the battle ends in a draw.\n\nThere are assault battles, where you are attacking or defending, and meeting engagements (\"encounter battles\") and standard battles where each side has a base and is attacking and defending. You can go into settings and choose which types of battles you want to fight. Maps are being continually updated and/or replaced so it is impossible to give much detail here, but suffice to say they are all vastly different and present different challenges.\n\nFor each battle you fight, you will be awarded \"experience\" and \"credits.\" Experience is what you use to research new tanks. Credits are the currency of the game, except for when you use actual currency to buy \"gold\" on Wargamers.net. Gold is very useful but not necessary to play the game. You play for free, but you will have certain advantages if you buy gold. You will be able to use gold to research faster, and more importantly, to buy \"gold ammo.\" Gold ammo has a higher penetration rating than normal ammo. It is despised by many players; others brag about using it. Others use it and deny it.\n\nGold can also buy you \"premium\" which grants you extra experience and credits. For example, a 9,000 credit award with a standard account would become about 14,000 credits with a premium and 250 experience would be closer to 400. Players who spend money will definitely get to the higher tier tanks more quickly.\n\nThere are ten tiers of tanks, numbered from I to X. Tier I tanks are the early tanks from before World War II. Tier X tanks are postwar tanks. Among the many tanks you can research are those which never left the drawing board. Some of these are superior to some historical tanks, a fact of us who enjoy the historical find frustrating. Nor are the tech trees developed by Wargamers.net by any means historical.\n\nIn addition to tanks, you will find self-propelled guns, or artillery. Many tankers hate artillery. Those who drive light tanks love to destroy artillery and if you play, you will soon understand why. Many a great tank duel has been terminated by the dreaded \"one-shot\" kill from an SPG. Artillery (\"arty\" for short) requires spotters (light tanks) who get their eyes on enemy vehicles so that the arty can brew them up. Some players, including me, would just as soon see arty given their own game where they can happily blow each other to bits and leave us to our tank battles.\n\nIn order to shoot at an enemy, you first must see him. Tanks have viewing ranges which can be improved through purchase of modules (like coated optics or binocular telescopes) and tanks can hide themselves through use of camouflage netting or by hiding behind bushes and rocks. It is very easy to be destroyed without ever seeing the tank that is killing you. I've been hit a half dozen times by an enemy tank without spotting it.\n\nThe game, like any game of this type, can be addicting. Battles are quick but the research tree and the lure of ever-more powerful tanks lead you into battle after battle. Typically, you have to wait no more than a few seconds to get into a battle and there is very little lag so it is easy to play game after game and suddenly discover the sun has gone down.\n\nSadly, as with all online gaming experiences, the adult has to deal with children. The back-and-forth babble can be tiresome but can also be ignored. The worst insult seems to be \"noob\" - a term often used more an an excuse for failure than anything else. Those killed early in a battle lover to critique the performance of those who are doing better than them. And no one is more detested than the \"camper\" even though some of the tanks (particularly German tanks) are designed to be \"snipers\" - a fact which demands the sniper \"camp.\"\n\nSadly, those lemmings who rush eagerly to early deaths become angry that all the more intelligent players did not follow them.\n\nBut the game is fun and it is free.\n\nThe graphics are good even at low to average settings, and it has decent sound effects, including the tank engines, the clank of tracks, and, of course, explosions. The music mostly goes by unnoticed, though the dramatic music often appears at the most unnerving moments.\n\nA word of advice: if you do not wish to spend money, you will find the most success at about tier V, where you get good and fairly balanced match-ups from the \"MM\" or matchmaker. Higher than that and tanks become less profitable in terms of credits and at tier VII you can easily lose 20,000 credits in a single battle, even if you are on the winning team, just because repairs and ammunition are so expensive. But there are many good tanks to be found on tier V and below. I enjoy playing my tier IV Matilda and my tier V French BDR G1 B.\n\nThe matchmaker is a target of attacks on a regular basis, pitting, for example, tier VII tanks against tier IX tanks. In many cases, the tier VII tanks might as well be throwing rocks at the tier IX tanks for their inability to even scratch their paint, let alone destroy them. Light tanks get even worse match-ups, with tier VIs going against tier Xs. The Tiger tank (all German tanks, really) suffer as a result of this. The Tiger I, king of the WWII battlefield, is a joke in WoT, easily swatted down by the prototype American T-29, which seems to be the best tier VII tank in the game, for some reason. Even the tier VIII Tiger II is easily destroyed by the T-29. The game is produced in Belarus. I don't know if that has anything to do with the bias against the German tanks.\n\nA strong community supports WoT and you can find a Wiki and various websites and numerous how-to videos on YouTube to support your addiction. It's not a bad way to spend a summer if you're indoors hiding from the heat or cold or rain, or convalescing.\n\nI give it 4 stars only because of the games notable flaws, some of them mentioned (artillery, prototype tanks better than historical, poor matchmaking). You will find you can only get to about tier VII without spending money before you start to lose credits on your battles and are forced to go back to tier V and VI tanks or lower.", "summary": "Fun yet Frustrating", "unixReviewTime": 1374537600}

The pre-release buzz seemed to indicate this was a space combat sim with a strong RPG element.

When not flying around and fighting in the main campaign, you can take on contracts which require you, to, well, fly around and fight. The contracts never have a back story; you are always told to take on X pirate group or y pirate group. It is shocking there is any trade or organized government with the 1,000's of pirates around. No missions to recover medicines for an endangered world nor rescues nor missions that require diplomacy, just flying and fighting. The storyline is very linear so that you are forced to do all these missions to get experience before you can proceed.\nThe voice acting by the computer run characters is awful.  Apparently gajillion-aire Microsoft's voice acting budget was blown getting John Rhys Davies and George Takei, for the same man does all the male voices and same woman does the female voices.  With repitious dialogue, the same thin, annoying voices  gets to you.\nI had hoped for something much better. For anyone with imagination, they will end up feeling disappointed.

This DS game, however, captures everything we love about the TV show and puts it into one great cartridge!\n\nWhile the game contains great platforming and cool settings in each level, it also captures the traditional Simpsons comedy while also embarking an entirely new storyline.\n\nDespite the fact that the cutscenes are in 3D, while they are 2D in the console versions, they feel very true to the show, and they will keep you laughing. The sound quality is fantastic, too. The story is about the dysfunctional family finding out that they are REALLY IN a video game! Later, however, the aliens try to take over Springfield. In order to fight back, the Simpsons must go into the game engine, and then get the ability to talk to, GASP, God!\n\nWant to see what a cutscene is like? Well, here's a sneak peak at what they say when they enter the game engine:\nHomer: I'm not a video game character. I'm a real life man with dreams and feelings. (Looks down, noticing he's floating over a gap) AAAaahh! (respawns) Okay, I'm a video game guy....\n\nYou can double jump and beat up enemies in your way. There are also some other moves you can do, like how Homer can turn into a giant ball, and Lisa can pick up things indirectly. Bart wears a Batman-style outfit and can fly, along with latching on certain points with the grappling hook.\n\nAfter getting through Simpsons-themed levels, you'll find DOZENS of hilarious video game parodies. One level, in fact, pokes fun at the Legend of Zelda series. Another is a spoof of Pokemon! In fact again, it even has turn-based battles against the made-up Pokemon-like creatures that are owned by certain kids from Springfield Elementary. Heck, even an old MARIO pops in a cutscene!\n\nYou can also unlock Frogger and Space Invaders parodies after beating the TreeHouse of Horror level. They are just as addicting as the original arcade games.\n\nThe 2 to 4 player Vs mode is fun, too. There are 3 different types of gameplay here: Get the Krusty Head (Bart), Golden Donut (Homer, but this plays identical to Krusty Head), and just plain battling.\n\nOne thing that might seem dull is how there are infinite lives. If you die, you respawn at the start or a checkpoint if you got one, but there's no life counter. I guess Matt G. decided to give us a chance at watching the cutscenes?\n\nOverall, this is one heck of a Simpsons game. It's an all new and funny chapter in the Simpsons series.

As the name implies, this expansion is all about Pets.  Your sims can have dogs (small or large), cats, birds and womrats (basically a guinea pig).  There are a lot of fun interactions to run the sims through with their pets.  Now for the details:\n\nPROS:\n\n* Pets!  Just about enough said there.\n\n* As with the people sims, pet sims are very well portrayed.  The movements and behaviors are very realistic.  Just have a people sim play with a cat with a teaser toy and you'll see what I mean.\n\n* Creating a Pet is as easy as creating a people sim.  You can modify their features, give them various colored collers, etc.  With little effort, I was able to create a cat that looks and behaves very much like our real life cat.\n\n* Create-a-pet also has ability to create a breed.  Don't find the breed you want?  Make one!  There is one exception, noted in the CONS section below, though.\n\n* Werewolves!  Don't get too friendly with that wolf that visits your lot...unless your people Sim is a Knowledge Sim.  They all seem to WANT to become a werewolf for some reason!  The matchmaker from Nightlife sells cures for lycanthropy if you're unfortunate, though.  (Hmm...Sims 2 had Aliens, University added Zombies, Nightlife added Vampires, Open for business added robots, and now we have werewolves.  Makes me wonder what the upcoming Season expansion will add...).\n\n* Pets can have jobs that add a little income to the family as well.  Service Pets, Security Pets and Show Pets are in high demand.  Just be ready to teach them tricks so that they can get those promotions.\n\n* Some nice new objects, floor tiles and wallpapers!  Most of it is Pet themed as should be expected, but these are actually more useful than much of what is in the \"Fun packs\".\n\n* New Tools.  The \"Hammer\" tool makes remodeling so much nicer!  If you want to make a room bigger, add some new walls outside of a current room, then use the Hammer tool to get rid of the one wall that's blocking the new addition from the old.  Much nicer than having to live with all of the previous walls!  Also, the walls you remove are assigned a value and then that much is added back to your funds, much like selling old objects to replace with new.  Remodeling isn't near as expensive as it used to be either.\n\n* Leveling Tool.  Another new tool allows you, with one click, to level an entire lot to the level of the sidewalk.  You used to have to drag the cursor over the whole lot (and you had to exclude the boundary squares) to level it and even then, there was no guarantee that it would be even with the sidewalk.  This new tool makes it much more simple and quick.  You can still use the old leveling tools if you want variable terrain, though.\n\n* Unlockable Goodies.  I can understand someone wanting everything available at the beginning, but unlockable content adds a little reward for accomplishing certain milestones.  This encourages more play (like we really need more incentive to play this game!).\n\n* Skunk! (Some might consider this a con).  Watch out for Stinky Skunk.  He (she?) will visit your lot sooner or later.  What happens if Stinky Skunk doesn't like your pet?  Well...let's just say you'd better have a people sim prepared to give your pet a bath and fast!\n\nCONS:\n\n* The Create a Pet/Breed utility, though great, for some reason doesn't allow you to modify a dog's leg length.  Because of this, creating a believable Dachshund (wiener dog) or Corgi is, as yet, impossible. I'm not a huge Dachshund fan (don't dislike them either), but I do like Corgis, so that was disappointing.\n\n* Bugs!  For some reason, some people sims have their wants disappear.  Having another controllable sim ask them what they want is one way around this, but it's a pain when you just need one more want satisfied to put the sim in gold status, but you don't know what they want!  That's a new bug that I've noticed with Sims 2 Pets.  Many of the bugs from previous Sims 2 expansions are still there as well.  Does EA know what a patch is?\n\n* Would have liked to have seen a new \"Pet Lover\" Aspiration in addition to the ones we already have.  There is one Lifetime Aspiration (one that creates permanent Platinum Status) for having 6 pets reach the top of their career chains (I believe this one is a potential life time aspiration for Fortune Sims), so the prospect wasn't completely ignored.\n\n* Taking care of and training Pets can be work.  If you're a glutton for punishment, get a sim couple who are still early in their careers with a toddler to take care of, then give them a male and female dog, have the dogs spawn puppies, and then start a home business (assuming you have Open for Business expansion).  If you accomplish this and keep everyone happy, my hat is off to you!  :-)\n\n* Birds and Womrats work similar to the Aquarium that already existed in the game (though you can interact with them, unlike the fish).  If you get busy with other things, they're easy to forget and they die (even if you keep the food dish full).  Birds can be taught to talk and they will fly around if you let them out of their cage (not sure why I put this paragraph in the CONS section).  I don't find the Saltwater aquarium any more exciting than the original one.\n\nIn summary, this is indeed the best Expansion Pack yet for Sims 2.  On a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this a 7 for fun alone.  The bugs, though not show stoppers, still led me to give it an overall score of 4 stars.  I still strongly recommend the game, though.  The fun does overcome the occasional frustration of the bugs.  This one will easily keep me occupied until the upcoming Seasonal/Weather Expansion (I'm assuming every house will need a roof for more than cosmetic reasons when that one comes out).", "summary": "The Best Expansion Yet!", "unixReviewTime": 1163462400}

McCoy", "reviewText": "I am writing this as a veteran of the series, I don't know how new players would fare here. This review is also spoiler free!\n\nNow to start there have been some updates innovations and changes since Apollo Justice. Scenes are most of the time now played out with full pixelated characters on screen rather than the \"from the waist up\" view. It'll seem odd at first but it does seem to make investigating large areas easier and after a tiny bit it comes almost naturally. Note: during investigations you can move the little Edgeworth with either the control pad or the stylus.\n\nEdgeworth, not being an attorney, also has a different flow to his stories and almost all scenes happen outside of the courtroom. Edgeworth's new tool is logic, wherein you take two nagging questions and link them together to answer them both. It's not a bad addition but is very simple compared to some of the previous puzzles of the franchise.\n\nReferences to events and items from the previous games are at every turn, and I mean EVERY turn! So if it's been a while it wouldn't hurt to replay the others first. Jokes and humor are great, and in the usual style, and the characters are definitely Phoenix Wright caliber. Edgeworth himself has lost a bit of his gruffness, he feels like a watered down version of his previous self, but this is kind of inevitable as you didn't have to watch the poor guy screw up nearly as often originally when you couldn't control him. XD\n\nAs for the stories they're good, yet the murders tend to be a bit more graphic than in previous games. It's not overly graphic, more like it's finally showing the Teen rating. As good as the stories are, the puzzles are rather simple and feels like you're more following obvious connections until the solution is handed to you.\n\nOverall I'm giving it a four because it really is a great Ace Attorney game with good graphics, writing, music, and stories, but it isn't quite up to the high points that Phoenix set for the series.

That is, if you look at it without paying attention to the gameplay or any of the technical stuff. It's one of those games you keep playing and playing and playing just to find out what's going to happen next.\n\nThe story revolves around Seto, a lonely boy who embarks on a journey after an old man, the only other human he has ever known, dies. The world he ventures into is a post-apocalyptic Japan riddled with old spirits of a civilization lost around 15 years ago. Seto is alone for the entire game, technically, for he meets various other characters, only one of which is human. The rest are spirits, robots and even a talking electronic device. Spirits of the dead haunt every corner and appear to Seto through bitter envy of him still living, and try to take his life away. Seto's goal is to find the silver-haired girl, who is the first person he meets other than the old man. Throughout the game, you are joining him on his journey, a journey that becomes much more complicated than just that.\n\nAll of this is the game's strongest point: its presentation. This is a story that will grip you by the heart and force you to see it through to the end. And trust me, it's worth every second. Xseed released a lot of very impressive games this generation, and this is no exception. Throughout the game, you will find many objects that people have left behind before they all died. These objects contain memories which Seto can listen to whenever he brings them back to a save point (more on this later). These memories give the world its depth. Much of them contain heartwarming memories of people when they were alive. Some are funny. Others are sad. Many emotions surround every corner of this game and you will feel it. You will also learn about plot-relevant past events via these memories, so finding these items is critical in order to fully enjoy the game.\n\nThe graphics and detail are also very well-done, especially for the Wii. It's no Xenoblade, but this game focuses more on intimate locations: inside old buildings, an amusement park, hallways, etc. You may find yourself looking around every room before moving on just to take in all of the details. Things people have left behind, nature's toll on structures over time. It feels very real, like you're part of the game. Cutscenes are executed very well too. The game's soundtrack is phenomenal. Every piece of music in the game is beautiful, and sets the tone of your situation perfectly. Even if you think this this game is not for you, the music is worth listening to on its own.\n\nThere are two main gripes I had with the game: its bare-bones gameplay, and Seto's voice. Yes, the second sounds like a ridiculous complaint, but once you start playing, it will probably grate on you after a while like it did to me. His voice is very nasally and whiny, and he never shuts up. It could have been done a little better. Most of the other voices I thought were fine. Some were actually quite good.\n\nThe gameplay was created in the spirit of survival horror games like the older Resident Evil games. Yes, Fragile Dreams can be pretty chilling at times, but it's usually due to the memories and setting rather than what's happening around you. I always felt like something really bad was going to happen to Seto or the girl or the few friends he meets, but only because of the plot. On the other hand, some of the enemies look and act rather silly. Enemies are also not very threatening either, for the game is quite easy overall. However, when first playing, combat is a bit of a struggle because Seto has very few attacks. At first, I had trouble just getting him to hit things, most notably the flying birds, but once I got the hang of it, it got boring. It's as simple as \"press A to attack and win\" for most enemies you find. No combat strategy is involved at all. You can even run from just about any enemy because none of them can catch up to you. So, that makes the whole \"survival horror spirit\" pretty moot. Plus, most bosses are either easy or just annoying.\n\nAlso, similar to Resident Evil, you have an inventory based on a grid which can only hold so many things at a time until you get to a save point. This is mostly just tedious. Nothing else. Items are everywhere, and you may find yourself going back and forth, to and from save points repeatedly. To make it worse, your weapons will break RANDOMLY, meaning it's best to keep more than one on-hand, which reduces your inventory space even further.\n\nTo top it off, the game is pretty short, with not much replay value. If you get really involved in the story like I did, it will last you around 15 hours or so, collecting and searching out every item possible. Otherwise, the game could be beaten in about 5 hours if one wanted to.\n\nIf you can get Fragile Dreams for cheap, then I highly recommend it to any fans of RPG's or even anyone wanting to see what survival horror genre is like... sort of. This is something very different and very enjoyable for anyone who likes a sense of meaning and depth behind the stories they like to immerse themselves in. The game will make you laugh, cry, smile, give you the warm fuzzies, or just make you irritated trying to replace your broken weapons after hitting a jellyfish-like ghost that doesn't even fight back.\n\n...How do weapons break after hitting nothing but ghosts anyway?", "summary": "A Unique, Heartfelt Journey", "unixReviewTime": 1379635200}

The included RCA (composite) video cable of the PS2 just looked awful on my 42\" LCD 1080p (blurry!), as was no surprise really.  A little research pointed me in the direction of this PS3/PS2 Sony brand component output cable, and I was very relieved to see the video quality upgrade between the two cable choices.  Component output is, of course, a much newer method of input for HDTVs vs. the old RCA style for old TVs, and it's nice to see the PS2 benefit greatly.\n\nAlthough games like Metal Gear Solid 2 still only run at 480i resolution on an HDTV, picture quality is significantly better with component output vs. composite.  No doubt.  Fairly good build quality on these, as well.\n\nNote:  my specific TV doesn't automatically ask if you wish to switch to the PS2 input when the PS2 is turned on as, say, the HDMI cabled PS3 does.

The game went on to become a huge classic and sell over a million copies.  Earlier this year, it was announced the game would go to the Playstation 3.  At first glance, it may not seem worthwhile to buy the game on the Playstation 3 if you played the 360 version, but some of the additions and enhancements just might change the minds of some gamers.\n\nIn the beginning of the game you are an unnamed man who happens to be on a plane that crashes seemingly out in the middle of nowhere.  Luckily, however, there is a lighthouse in sight.  Once you step inside it is quite clear that this is no ordinary lighthouse and soon you descend in the undersea world of Rapture.  Rapture is a totally free society in which no one is ruled by anyone, and it was built by a man named Andrew Ryan.  Unfortunately, Rapture is anything but perfect.  The once perfect world has now become imperfect and is overrun with splicers who thrive on Adam.\n\nBioshock has an incredible story that digs much deeper than simply being about a central antagonist and protagonist.  In the end it'll make you think.  It's a very absorbing game.  Even is how it looks.  It looked incredible on the XBOX360, but the visual experience is enhanced on the Playstation 3 and it looks even better than it did before.  Much of it looks very real.  Even better is the artistic design and attention to detail.  The atmosphere itself is absorbing as well and really makes the world come alive.\n\nThroughout the city you'll also find recorded radio diaries that give you a good idea of what happened to Rapture.  The voice acting in these diaries, and throughout the games various cutscenes is incredible.  It really helps anyone become absorbed into the world.\n\nPlaying Bioshock is an even better experience.  At it's heart it is a first person shooter.  You'll find weapons that you can use to take down the splicers.  Throughout Rapture you'll also find plasmids which you can use to help you take down certain enemies.  Some Plasmids can be used to electrocute splicers, or manipulate others.  There's a lot to BioShock's gameplay that makes it interesting.  In addition to the weapons and plasmids you can also hack the shopping arcades to lower prices, as well as hack security cameras and gun turrets to help you out against your enemies.\n\nThere's nothing incredibly difficult about it's gameplay.  It's simple enough.  Perhaps a little too simple.  Bioshock is not a game where you ever really permanently die.  If you happen to die you'll respawn from a Vita-Chamber where you'll be able to go right back up to the enemy that killed you.  The enemy's health never changes.  So essentially, if you're stuck you can keep respawning until you kill whatever it is giving your trouble.  This essentially means BioShock is never too difficult.  You may get tired of dying, but you can never die permanently.\n\nWhat exactly is new in Bioshock on the PS3?  Well, the graphics are smoother and you get a new difficulty setting.  While the new difficulty is enticing, it doesn't really add too much.  The enemies are stronger and you pick up less ammo etc., but it's not really enough to entice anyone who owns the 360 version to really pick this one up.  So if you've played one of the previous versions of Bioshock, there isn't really too much here that makes it worth getting again.  At least not for the price tag of the game itself.\n\nBioshock is still an amazing game even a year later.  It may not be worth it to buy the PS3 version if you've played the XBOX360 version already, but if you have a PS3 and you haven't played Bioshock yet, it's worth checking out.", "summary": "\"I Chose...

I missed out on TLoU when it was originally released on the PS3.  I saw all the commentary on reddit, all the memes floating around the Internet, and I was unable to participate.  So, when I was looking at consoles, I wanted the one that could play TLoU - and I bought a PS4.\n\nThe Remastered version looks like the other PS4 games I've been playing.  I'm not sure if this is a credit to the original release, or to the remastering process...  But it doesn't feel like a PS3 game that was just ported.  The visuals are stunning.  The environments are beautifully-realized.  The controls are intuitive and responsive.  There's been absolutely no moment where I felt like I was playing some previous-generation title.\n\nThe game, itself, is terrific.\n\nI've played plenty of \"zombie\" games over the years, but none quite like this.  The zombies themselves are a fresh take on an old trope.  They aren't undead.  It isn't some mysterious virus.  There's no magic. It's all based on the real cordyceps fungus, which adds a nice level of realism to the narrative.  The enemies themselves - be they human antagonists or the infected - are varied and challenging.  Just when I was getting used to how one group behaved, I'd be faced with a new challenge and new behaviors.\n\nThe storyline was genuinely gripping.  You follow Joel and Ellie on their cross-country journey to find the Fireflies and possibly develop a cure.  Along the way both of them are developed as real characters.  Unlike most games I've played - Ellie, as the companion you are escorting, is genuinely helpful.  She doesn't just get in the way.  She isn't easily killed.  She's helpful in solving various environmental puzzles.

On one level, it's a 3rd person shooter with some obvious Star Wars influences, but on another level it's a clever stealth / mystery game where violence isn't always the best answer, and sometimes is the worst. John's psychic powers allow him to walk right past enemies or hammer them with telekinesis. Yet in many ways, the ideas and the world of the game seem underdeveloped, and in this respect Second Sight ultimately falls short.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Excellent\n\nI played SECOND SIGHT on the Gamecube, YMMV on other platforms.\n\nGameplay in SECOND SIGHT involves using weapons or psychic powers to defeat enemies and progress through several levels. The emphasis is on stealth, really, and there are very few places where it's advisable to reach for that gun when you have another option. Weapons and psychic powers cannot be used simultaneously, which makes good sense in some cases but not so much in others (why not use Charm while you're holding a tranquilizer gun?). Most powers (TK, Psi Attack, Projection) utilize telekinesis, though the Charm and Possession powers are more telepathic in nature. Unfortunately, the targets of telekinetic powers are a little limited, and oddly so. For instance, although you can use the TK power to lift a guard and bash him into a wall, you cannot use it to close a door. A little more thought could have made things work a lot better.\n\nAiming guns and powers is fairly intuitive, although fine-tuning the aim can be a bit of a problem because you'll occasionally switch targets instead of moving the reticule. Movement is also pretty simple; climbing up and down small obstacles is automatic, and passing through vents and tunnels is simple. Stealth moves allow you to plaster yourself against a wall, though if you're not careful with your controller you might accidentally edge around the corner instead of leaning past it. Additionally, there are 2-3 (depending on the situation) different camera views available. However, the fixed 3rd person camera is often poorly placed, and the free-rotation camera sometimes simply will not go where you want it to. The 1st person camera is sometimes entirely unavailable, and cannot be used while you are moving. As a consequence, you are occasionally forced to rely on very awkward camera angles which make it hard to aim.\n\nThe moveable props could have been handled better -- throughout the game John runs into carts, boxes, and similar items. Regardless of their size or apparent weight, they all tumble around as if they were made of paperboard, while making noise as if they were drums. None of them give any impression of weight at all, which I'm inclined to regard as the product of an absent or simply atrocious physics engine. Since this is a stealth game, and any collision is likely to give you away, you're best off avoiding these suckers entirely. Immobile props such as computers are handled very well, though... and the interaction with doors is top-notch, with a very useful \"peek\" feature.\n\nThe level design is also a little disappointing. The first two levels are understandably straightforward, but the third is fantastic, with two main alternate routes through a facility and a number of other minor choices that can be made along the way. This promising level is never again matched, however -- all subsequent levels are depressingly linear. Additionally, the levels in many cases feel very much like you're in a game: completely unrealistic. The Madness level is the best example of this, particularly with regard to the library. The asylum library has three doors: one of them leads to a basement area with a bunch of boarded-over doors, and the other two lead into a room that doesn't have any other exit except for a vent. Unless one believes that the doctors in the library got their by climbing through windows or crawling through the ductwork, it's difficult to accept that it's a real library in a real building. This is only one example, but there's a lot of this sort of thing throughout the game. That third level, though...\n\nThere are two levels where you have to lead someone who's totally helpless, and several levels where you have useful allies. Both work pretty well, but Jane's AI can occasionally be pretty deficient in the levels where you're rescuing her. You'd best position her carefully if you open any grates, is all I can say.\n\nOverall, the game is very easy and natural to play, with just a few hiccups. The levels are not as developed as they could be, and are pretty linear, which is a sin in a game this short, but they are a lot of fun to play and master. The psychic powers are a lot of fun, though, and also allow for some unique problem-solving.\n\nSTORY: Excellent\n\nThe story of SECOND SIGHT is set up as a mystery of an unusual sort. John Vattic seems to waver backwards in forwards through time, rapidly establishing where he came from (a secret op with the WinterICE team) and where he ended up, but concealing exactly how it was he got from one to the other. The mystery deepens as his past continues to unfold, because each time he has a flashback, things in the present seem to change. The weirdness and paranoia build to a very nice (and frankly unforeseen) twist near the end of the game. Here again, however, some possibilities are not realized. Some aspects of the Madness mission suggest a red herring that John is insane, but this never really gets played out fully. The chief antagonist of the story doesn't get a solid introduction until far too late, and in the best traditions of video game villains doesn't really seem to have any motivation for his behavior. Other characters are much better developed, and John in particular works out very well. Grienko, in his brief appearance, also strikes an excellent balance between ghoul and grandpa with a really wonderful bit of dialogue.\n\nAUDIO: Good\n\nThe music can grate on you after a while, but has some nice aspects and is overall fairly good. The voice acting is not stellar, but it is competent. Some accents don't work -- JC seems almost insulting to Hispanics, and Jane's on-again, off-again English accent is a mess. The voice actors for the children sound like they're trying just a little too hard for that Russian accent. But none of it really made me cringe, and in a couple of places the voice acting really added to the game.\n\nVISUALS: Good\n\nThe graphics were pretty nice overall, and I don't recall encountering even one glitch. Some of the props had really great designs, and there were one or two environments that were simply wonderful to look at (a rickety-looking scaffold in the final level comes to mind). At the same time, everything looked a little too clean and artificial; there wasn't enough dirt on the walls, so to speak. Lots of areas had a monotonous appearance, even the ones that weren't supposed to be military installations.\n\nThe characters were a little too blocky, for the most part, and in some cases fell victim to odd exaggerations that seemed out of place. In one cutscene, Jane's eyes looked absolutely huge, to the point where they went past anime-style cuteness to outright creepiness. In another, Colonel Starke looked like some kind of bizarre frog-man, his mouth stretching almost halfway around his head. Also, the enemies were very uniform in their appearance. To some extent this is excusable because all of them are in uniform, but it bears mentioning that each member of the WinterICE team has a unique appearance despite the same handicap. A little more could have been done with the enemies.\n\nREPLAYABILITY: Average\n\nSecond Sight is too short, from a pure gameplay perspective. The levels as currently designed do all they need to from a story standpoint, and indeed, with respect to the plot development, additional levels might be detrimental. However, as a game it does not last long enough. While an additional difficulty level can be played once a level is completed, only one new sublevel appears, and since you aren't notified of it you might never notice it. There is some entertainment value in trying to work through levels using different methods (perhaps focusing on stealth instead of force), but since only the third level allows a true alternate route, there's really not much to do in this regard. Unless the sheer fun of using the psychic powers gives you a kick (and they are a lot of fun), then subsequent plays aren't going to do it for you.\n\nThe game includes a pretty comprehensive (though occasionally obscure) statistics record for each level. However, it's not possible to prevent yourself from going on to the next level in-game, and if you quit a level it will get registered as a mission failure, even if you exit it at the very first moment. Without the option of replaying a single level, the statistics can quickly become skewed.\n\nOVERALL: Accomplished (81%)\n\nSecond Sight is a very good game that could have been better. One or two more levels, and an added cutscene or two to develop the antagonist would have done wonders for the experience. A little tweaking of the camera, some expansions in the level design, and a bit more care with the props would also have improved the game measurably. Nonetheless, the story and the strong gameplay make this a worthy purchase.", "summary": "Just shy of fulfilling its potential", "unixReviewTime": 1115164800}

More importantly, the audio quality you get from this set is a lot higher than you might anticipate. Besides cranking all my volumes at max, I ran a few bass tests, and they did significantly better than one might expect from a low cost pair of over-ear headphones. The mic quality works perfect, although you need to make sure it is fairly close to your mouth as the pick up range on it isn't that far. I saw in some reviews that if you turn down the dial on the controller when using the mic, it turns down your recorded audio volume too when you bring it back up. I found that to be wrong as I ran a test where I talked from the dial at 0% and slowly raised it to 100% and it stayed consistent throughout.\n\nOverall, a very solid and good looking headset that I highly recommend over anything name brand within that price range and then some to be quite honest.

Blair", "reviewText": "So I got this game the 18th of may and have put in some solid time on the game in multiple classes before making this review. The game was bought by both me and my wife as anniversary gifts for each other. Currently this game is my only blizzard product in my house I would not consider my self their fan boy or beat writer in any way shape or form. Due to purchasing the game after the initial server stutters and DOS attacks on blizzards servers I have a game that for me has performed flawlessly on blizzards end. I did some research before hand and found out the game would be only on line which for me was no draw back it would be just like playing COD online or any multiplayer shooter online for me. That being said I truthfully prefer single player games over multiplayer games,I think games like Planescape torment, Baldur's gate and any of the elder scrolls are ultimately more fulfilling video game experiences in the scheme of things. So now that I have laid the mortar for the foundation of my review let me begin.\n\nSound, the music and sound effects in this game are very well done, Blizzard has a good track record for good music and sound in games, the voices weren't amazing for some characters but it didn't ruin the experience in any way shape or form, the music however did put a nice level of ambience into the game.\n\nGraphics- to me the least important factor in any game, that being said blizzard did a great job on the graphics of the game, the level of detail to the environments is pretty stunning and unseen for the isometric view in games today. Each area has its own style and is very unique, for the most part the environments manage to be unique throughout the game and each act has its own art style. I loved the way they did the environments for the abyss areas the best they didn't get my personal image of hell perfectly but it did look great like tromping around inside the desicated carcass of a demonic beast. The character models to me were generic yet still managed to be well done though should not have truly been the focus of an isometric view game. My only ding for the graphics of the game were the inability to change the view point in the game or adjust the camera. I can understand that for many games this can create bugs for abilities or transparent environments so for me not a huge deal.\n\nStory-The story was generic and predictable to me it was like any other action RPG game though as far as storyline goes I wouldn't be playing an action RPG if that's what I wanted. Let's be honest everyone knew exactly what was going to happen in this game, diablo was going to be in the game and the brave heroes were going to kill diablo any one who didn't know something like that wasn't going to happen probably should have looked elsewhere for a game. That being said I did like some of the characters in the game, specifically Shen he is the best character in the game by far, his dialogue is funny and a good change up in the game.\n\nGameplay- Now folks this is where the meat and potatoes of this genre come into play, Diablo 3 does exceptionally well when it comes to aspect of controls and gameplay mechanics. Alot of people have had problems with the game being click based, its a computer what did you expect you would be using a crystal ball. Anyways each one of the classes in the game plays very different and is unique to the other classes in the game. The rune system was fantastic and very well implemented its unlike any of the other systems I have seen in games I would say what I like most about the system is that encourages multiple play styles, so though you may have the exact same character as another person you aren't forced into a niche to play that character a certain way. I love the multiplayer component for the game, I love having friends drop into my game and it increasing the challenge and increasing the loot that drops I think the way Blizzard implemented that service was flawless and went without a hitch. For this game the gameplay is its strong point, it is fun exciting and entertaining, I have logged over a 100 hours into this game on several characters both me and my wife still play it together on our shared internet connection. Just to explain our internet is not top of the line its standard cable internet connection and just runs us 30 dollars a month. Also for people are dissatisfied with instant allocation of skill points and talents change the game to elective mode in game play options.\n\nOverall I think that this game is a solid step in the right direction. I barely played diablo 1 and 2 so I didn't lofty and unrealistic expectations for this game. I hope more games go the only online route, as a matter of fact I hope that hard copies of games disapear for ever and the middle man gets cut out of the gaming industry, that should reduce the price of games because as it stands now as the third world countries these discs are made in get a higher standard of living, these games we love will increase in prices. DRM is the way of the future unfortunately, producers have been burned by us as players and this is a result. I love this game and I am going to play it right now. This is my opinion on this game.

Being special for more than one reason, this latest entry into the series is not only releasing on the 20th Anniversary, but has also broken a trend that it once had by simultaneously releasing on more than a single platform with Sonys PlayStation 3 and 4, as well as the PC.\n\nTaking on the role of Sorey, players will get to explore a brand new world in a manner that has not been done before with the series. Gone are the areas, the zones, and the sub-zones that all required their own loading times. Having moved instead and pushing the PS3 to its higher limits in which the PS4 easily followed, Tales of Zestiria takes a more open-like world approach in order to tell its tale. Having gone in this direction only enhances the experience to be had. Running through the wide open fields actually feels natural as where the area is cut off is quite literally where the player cannot go any further in that direction and not because its just another area limiter. Dungeons and passageways have also benefited of this as the entire location can be loaded in one sitting allowing for a smooth exploration instead of various loading screens as one area is left for another. There are still some locations that are segmented but these are so rare and the load times so quick that they aren't even noticeable.\n\nHaving taken the wider opened approach was a design choice not only taken for exploration, but also for battle which made for some quite interesting encounters at times. Gone are the transition screens that take a few moments in order to load up the battles which have instead been replaced with nothing more than the main character leaping backwards and the other characters appearing ready for combat. While this may sound a bit odd, it makes sense within the stylistic approach to the story in which not all of the main characters are human but instead are more spiritual beings that live inside of our hero.\n\nBattle themselves for the first time in the series take place exactly where the enemy was run into on the field. Tight corridors, open spaces with sparse trees, wide open rooms are all fair game. Most of the time the size of the area doesnt really need to be taken into consideration as theres more than enough room to engage your foes. Where things can start to get a bit dicier however is when powerful foes move farther and faster than you do in smaller spaces and the saying Im not trapped in here with you, you're trapped in here with me does not apply. Battling in the same environments that are being explored instead of a simulated space that looks and feels like it belongs there added to the open minded style and fit in quite nicely. Where there can be a bit of a disconnect at times is that as smooth as it is going into battle, the exit transition uses a quick fade to black instead of simply showing the results and letting the characters move on. While it doesnt hugely affect the experience, it is enough that it is noticed when everything else is as smooth as it is.\n\nNamco has been making the Tales of Series for a long time and the combat systems has seen many iterations and modifications in which some were loved and others may not be as fondly remembered. Tales of Zestiria has put into place what I think may have been the best that they could have ever designed. Characters have Hit Points as theyve always had but gone are any other form of points that would limit the usage of Artes or combos in general. Instead of any of these, Zestiria gives players what they called the Spirit Chain that is used for any and all actions in battle. Normal attack combinations, special attack combinations or even powerful moves are all done and based off this meter that will refill itself through various available means or simply standing still for several seconds.\n\nHaving gone the route of the Spirit Chain allows for a lot more flexibility in battle as in certain ways players do not need to be as careful with their resources. In other ways however they have to be all the more so as this new system works in the manner of a double edged sword. Having all the battle capabilities at your fingertips without worry of running out is one thing, but overdoing it can land your character in some rather perilous situations as they will not be able to dodge or even run out of the way using the free run system until their meter has somewhat replenished itself. With skills that can be equipped through the various pieces of equipment, there are a variety of ways in order to help refill these gauges than by simply standing still and finding them will be key to quick and easy battles with minimal harm to your party.\n\nEquipment has also taken a change for the better as a first for the series. Instead of having static equipment per vendor in town X before moving over to town Y, there can be various iterations of this piece of equipment that comes with different skills to modify various attributes from health, defense, to methods of regaining portions of your Spirit Chain by performing specific actions in battle. Fretting over which piece may or may not be better than another is also not as important as it once was as equipment of the same name can be fused together in order to add, change, or enhance the skills that come with it. With a form of a skill combination table that can be seen at all times in the equipment window, careful planning of your equipment can change your battle prowess from the likes of a street cat into a powerful Liger.\n\nWith all of the exploration, all of the battling, Sorey thankfully does not need to do it alone however most people will think him insane nonetheless. Of the main party of characters, very few of them are actual humans which not only is interesting from a story perspective, but also aids to enhance the final portion of the combat. In the world of Zestiria, there exists being known as the Seraphim. We, you and I, know these to be angelic beings pertaining to a higher power, Zestirians know them to be beings of spirit that help keep the balance of the natural order of things. Well those that remember them being more than pieces of legends and lore left behind from the ages. What is interesting is that the Seraphim do not need to be human in nature. Like the normal living beings, they can take all forms of shapes and sizes from looking human over to being a dog or a miniature looking humanoid cat. The biggest catch to their appearance however is that they are not perceptible to the normal human eye and only select few can see, hear, touch, and interact with making it quite weird for anyone else looking upon such an interaction.\n\nAs we explore the world through the eyes of Sorey, the Seraphim are always within view and can be seen in every corner of the world in a variety of different situations. Every now and then however, the shift in the point of view changes to another character who simply sees Sorey talking to himself, fighting something that isn't there, and think hes rather crazy for doing so. I mean who attacks a dust cloud to have their sword clink off of it as though it hit metal? Sorey is known as the Shepherd, the one who would save the world from the Lord of Calamity that would see the world sunk into darkness. Seraphim unlike humans are a lot more susceptible to the dark and thus if their feelings are brought too far out of whack become known what are hellions. Normal humans would see these are deranged people, vicious dogs, dust clouds, or water torrents. Anyone with the sight ability akin to that of the Shepherd or other Seraphim would see them for what they really are. Demonic beings of power that would tear everything limb from limb and wreck havoc and destruction.\n\nWhile Sorey grew up with the Seraphim, all of this is normal to him. Moving over into the rest of the world for the first time, he sees wonders never seen before but when it comes to the Seraphim themselves he forgets that not everyone can see them. Its these shifts in the point of view at times that can bring on a awkward feeling of understanding for those around him as they don't quite understand whats going on and wonder if there may be a few loose screws. The subtle shifts in the dialog and the characters can be quite entertaining especially when one is essentially being left out of the loop and they don't even know it. Able to Squire another under their banner and their service, Sorey can lend the sight and the powers to another to fight alongside him at least trying to alleviate the weirdness of this unseen world to the other which leads to the final portion of the battle mechanics. Fusions.\n\nWith two human characters in the party, the rest of the Seraphim can either fight alongside them or be fused with into a more powerful being of a particular element. Fire, Water, Air, or Earth Seraphim can be joined with which takes the battle party down by one member but increases the battle potential by several degrees into the partys favor as long as the right elements are being used. This form that can be used by the Shepherd or the Squire is unlimited in time but has prerequisites to be met before hand that honestly are not that hard to come by. Being inputted as more of a standard feature instead of a be all / end all / save for a critical moment, learning the move sets of each element is going to be easy enough as it is never hard in order to pull it off as it still falls under the purview of the Spirit Chain for standard attacks and arts feeling like a standard elements and not something drastically different.\n\nTales of Zestiria has honestly set a new bar for the series in more ways than one with the variety of improvements and new ideas that have been implemented. Between an amazing new cast, great voice acting, new smooth battling system, and a gorgeous open-like world to see, the next entry of Tales of Berseria will have a lot to live up to with how well theyve crafted Zestiria.", "summary": "An outstanding adventure, through and through", "unixReviewTime": 1451433600}

Mostly I just play the 2d games he has downloaded to the Virtual Console using the Classic Controller (Gradius, Zelda, R-Type). As soon as I first started playing with it I fell in love with it. For starters, it is basically a throwback to the old flat style pads like the NES and SNES controllers, except with two analog sticks at the bottom like a Playstation controller (except the tops don't have that \"click in\" button). They also have nifty little octogon shaped housing which helps you \"slip\" into the directions (like N64 and Gamecube). The D-Pad is one of the most accurate and \"best feeling\" I've ever felt, something like that of a DS. There's a full cross, not stupid separated arrows with an indent between them like PS gamepads and it's also got some kinda coating that allows your thumb to glide over it.\n\nThe Start- Select+ and Home buttons are solid round plastic, not rubber and they have a distinct \"clicky\" feel to them. The old YXBA buttons from the SNES also feel really solid and can be pushed really fast without feeling like they're going to break or wear out. The L and R buttons are also there, except now they are analog (guess its for racing games gas pedal?). Placement of the additional ZL and ZR Buttons is a little odd but you can get used to it. (They fix this on the Classic Pad Pro, which so far has not been released outside of Japan and can only be obtained via importing).\n\nThe only faults I can see with the Classic Controller is the fact the cord exits from the bottom instead of the top like a normal controller, also \"Home\" is sunk in compared to the rest of the buttons, making it a bit difficult to press unless you've got good fingernails. Other than that it's a really great controller.

The 3D camera *automatically* swings up and down in HUGE angles when you're in cramped spaces, and it really messes up the enjoyment when I can't target the mob I'm trying to fight; and even when I'm not fighting, who wants ordinary exploration to be an exercise of teeter-tottering your mouse just so you can get a good view? This is true for all Guild Wars campaigns (namely, Prophecies, Factions, and Nightfall). One would think their developers and quality assurance people would have noticed this and flagged this is a serious flaw, but it somehow went by ignored. I have played various 3D games (both single player and MMORPG like Everquest 2), I have *NEVER* seen the 3D camera angle handled this way. Fortunately, most of the game terrain is not in cramped and enclosed areas, so I'm guessing that's why they let this glaring flaw slide by, but be forewarned that this can cause an inordinate amount of frustration when this issue rears its ugly head at the wrong time.\n\nIn Factions (more so than the other two campaigns), they have made diabolical multi-tiered maps that zig-zag like crazy, making it very hard to find certain quest spots. Right at the very first spot I started (Kaineng Center), it was already apparent that the designers wanted to waste your time so you can run all the way to a spot because the starburst on the map is telling you you're getting close to your target, only to find out you are arriving at a dead end and have to traverse all the way back through your original path so you can try an alternate route. I'm sorry, but in my book, this is cheesy; quests should not be an exercise in trickery and wasting the player's time this way. I have played Prophecies and Nightfall, and they weren't like that, but Factions has a place called Arborstone which I consider the \"map from hell\". I had a quest there to protect some stone singers, and I couldn't get to one area somehow. After more than an hour of running around in circles, I just abandoned the quest. Arborstone was also the place where the vertical angle swinging problem was REALLY BAD because the passageways were enclosed between very high ravine walls, and the 3D camera was just going crazy bobbing up and down by itself!\n\nThis is really too bad because the game graphics is excellent, better than Everquest 2, best I've ever seen in MMORPG games, paralleled only by some of the well-known single-player RPG games (e.g. Elder Scrolls, Titan Quest, etc.) But the game design is inferior in many respects to its competitors. For example, the game allows people to group, but they frequently end up in disaster because players don't have a good way to synchronize targets. In Everquest 2, clicking a player in the group automatically makes you share his target; usually, group members must be attacking what the tank is attacking. In Guild Wars, you have to ctrl-click the mob, and the chat window will say \"{name} is attacking {monster name}\". The problem with this is that it happens a lot where a group of monsters can have two or more of the same kind of monster, so the team members can still end up in confusion as to which mob to target. This cannot be underestimated because there are groups that are very powerful that could wipe out your group fast if you don't whittle them down in number fast.\n\nIt is typical among games that quests require you to move around, talking to various NPCs, to complete the quest. But this campaign, Factions, a lot of the quests require you to move a LOT and over extensive distances across a multi-tiered map. Frequently, I'd be on the 3rd level of the map and see my goal (shown as a star) on the map, only to find out it was on the 1st level (*groan*). It wasn't fun.\n\nGuild Wars also took the easy way out on typical aspects of MMORPG games. For instance, vendors pretty much sell the same stuff over and over in the *entire* game, maybe increasing by one or two items as you progress into more advanced zones. I feel no excitement when I see a vendor in a new zone, because I know what to expect. There is also very little variety in terms of weapon and armor stats, although they do have a good variety on the looks of armor. There are no player vendors, no housing, no mounts, and a very poor feel of community (since you only get to see other human players in town because all zones are instanced, meaning you have a copy of the zone for yourself, and you'll be alone in there with your NPC members unless you had invited a friend to explore that zone with you while you were in town). Their Beast Taming is the lamest I have ever seen; you can tame warthogs, flamingos, tigers, lions, cranes, etc., real lousy pets; I'm not sure I'd like to use them to fight demons. You can have only one pet at a time, and I am willing to bet that 90% of the Beast Tamers (which is part of the Ranger class) don't know how to get rid of their pet because it's simply so unintuitive.\n\nI've been going over the negative things, let me say the positives. I've already mentioned their beautiful graphics. They have no monthly fee. The entire game can be downloaded (without the need of a CD); so you can buy the game from their web site if you want, and you'll be given a link to start downloading. Game is very stable; I've never had it crash on me, but I guess this can depend on how stable one's PC is, too. The looks of the characters were excellently done; it may not give you as much berth in customizability as games like Elder Scrolls, but the faces and bodies look attractive and don't look polygonal. The creature artificial intelligence is excellent; I have seen mob behavior in this game that I've never seen in any other game. As mentioned prior, they do have a great variety of attire (which you can mix and match, if you want), along with the ability to dye them so that people really do look different. Each class has it's own dance choreography, and they are very well done, smooth in animation just as all player movements are in the game.\n\nNCSoft is going to start on Guild Wars 2, scheduled to beta on 2008. I guess the flaws on Guild Wars is way too deep-rooted in the framework and very difficult to fix or enhance, so they just decided to rewrite and start from scratch. Well I hope they do much better this time, because if they would just retain their great graphics and add more (un-cheesy) content, I do have to admit it is a good feeling moving around in the game because their zones are very artistic and well done (except for those with multi-tiered, zig-zagging zones that are meant to trick you into taking the wrong way).\n\nThe only reason I didn't give this game a 1-star is because the graphics are really beautiful, and the sceneries are very well done. But it just goes to show that great graphics doesn't make a good game.", "summary": "Could have been very good, but they messed it up", "unixReviewTime": 1188950400}

My biggest concern was though, that you HAD to be online in order to play. I do NOT like to be forced to be online to play my games. So buying this game sounded more and more like getting a ticket for a ride at the carnival. Which it kind of is...\n\nBUT! After getting over my rebellious self and just buying this game on sale, it turned out to be just as awesome as the previous games by Blue Byte. The installation went very smoothly, although the patching took quite a while. Uplay is yet another futile Origin/Steam clone but I guess it's a trend we just have to live with nowadays.\n\nNow for the game itself, it is VERY much like Dawn of Discovery (almost too much), but with a lot of new interesting features. Being able to choose to go green or choose the polluting dark side is very much a plus. There are also many neat details added that make the world so much more alive than any other strategy games, that it's a constant pleasure just to zoom in and check on what's going on from close up. Most important new thing is the below sea-level mode, which adds even more depth (pun intended) to the game. It's challenging and the constant online connection blends into the gameplay, so that it actually does make some sort of sense to have it implemented (although it still bugs me that you can NOT play without an active connection on the single player parts).\n\nSo epic fail or win? A bit of both. But if you like games like the Settlers series or the other Anno games, you'll enjoy this one just as much. Thumbs down for the forced connection during single player games, the need to purchase the DLC pack for the full experience and somewhat too many DRMs, but big thumbs up for making a future based, revamped and improved version of Anno/Dawn of Discovery which will keep you playing for quite a while.\n\nIn the end, it's all about the game.", "summary": "Great game if you liked Dawn of Discovery or Settlers", "unixReviewTime": 1358812800}

With some nail-biting missions and astounding detailed levels!  It is no doubt this game will be a hit among the Star Wars Universe Fans.  The best feature of this game is the Multiplayer support.  It is really something to be in the middle of 8 Jedi's all locked in Saber battles.  Let's take a look at this game as it does have its downs.\n\nThe STORY - You return as Kyle to help the Old Republic defend itself from a new evil.  A evil called Dessan and his army of Dark Jedi's.  A misson you are on reveals this new threat to the Old Republic and the death of Kyle's partner Jan, fuels the fire of Kyle to find and stop Dessan.  Dessan ultimate purpose is to create a army of invincible Dark Jedi's to rid the universe of the Jedi's sworn to protect the secrets of the Force.  Dessan feels that the Force is not something you proctect people from, but something you rule people by.  Get ready for a excellent storyline in this new Star Wars adventure.\n\nThe GRAPHICS - Are some of the best I have seen!  Bearing in mind you have a excellent computer with a high calibur video card.  I am currently running a ATI Radeon 8500 and the game looks spectacular.  I personally don't like crisp clear pefect graphics.  I like the graphics to have a little noise in it, for example the graphics in Return to Castle Wolfenstien.  But if you enjoy this, then by all means praise the graphics!  Storm Troopers will look nice and crisp as they attempt to blast you throughout the levels.\n\nThe GAMEPLAY is very smooth with the in game cutscenes.  Controls can be hotkeyed to your preference with enable you to have force powers ready at your fingertips.  You have a wide variety of weapons including a stun baton, rocket launcher, thermal detonators, rocket launcher, sniper rifle and the popular, non-accurate blaster rifle.  And of course you already know about the Light Saber.  The is the ultimate weapon that allows block weapons fire and slice your enemy's at close range at at a distance.  And don't worry about losing your saber, you can always get it back with the flick of your wrist.\n\nThe A.I. - Oh man, there are some ups and downs in the A.I. in this game.  There was only one time I have seen Storm Troopers run in a movie and that was when Han Solo was chasing them in the Death Star.  Storm troopers move like they are on some type of drug when you attempt to shoot them which is kinda of annoying.  If you come accross Imperial Officers, shoot them fast because they are extremely accurate.  Other Jedi's fight you on a level that is distrubing.  The lesser Jedi's are nothing compared to some of the Jedi's you will face off with in the later levels.  Dessan is one bad mother when you fight him.  Many of his blows will knock you down. And not to mention some Saber battles involve more than 2 jedi's at one time.\n\nIn conclusion, there are some great aspects of this game, mainly the action sequences.  In my opinion there are WAY TOO MANY PUZZLE AND SPACE WASTER MISSIONS.  I can understand having puzzles in games to take a break from the actions, but for this type of game, it should have been more action based.  In the last levels, making your way to the Jedi Academy will really drive you up the wall because of the environment.  The best aspect of this game is hands down the multiplayer. It is what makes this game really shine.", "summary": "It takes more than the Force to become a Jedi...", "unixReviewTime": 1020124800}

The game was \"Myst 3: The Exile.\"  Being an old Myst fan I snapped it up, despite its high price.  Once home I found that this is a limited numbered edition (70500 copies) which contains the four CD's of the game itself, the Prima Strategy Guide, a CD of the game soundtrack, and a CD of the making of the game.  Last, but not least is a pewter miniature of a `Squee.'  There seems to be enough to sooth almost anyone's collecting greed.\nThe basic premise of the game is quite straightforward (if you are familiar with Myst).  Atrus has invited you to come over to talk about Releeshahn, the new world he has created.  He has gathered together the surviving D'ni so that they might move to this new world to start their civilization over.  Just as he's about to show you the book that acts as the transfer station to Releeshahn a strange character with a severe case of bad hair appears out of nowhere, snatches the book and vanishes after setting Atrus' study on fire.  All he leaves behind is a transfer book to J'nanin, the training world built for Atrus' two insane sons.  Being a natural hero, you grab the book and hare out after the thief.\nIn short order you discover that Saavedro, the thief, is seeking revenge for the destruction of his world by Sirrus and Achenar, Atrus's sons and the villains of the original \"Myst.\"  A tragic figure who has lost his home, his family and a good bit of his sanity, Saavedro is bent on vengeance.  Unable to track down the sons, he has focused on the father, and turned J'nanin into a huge trap.  Travelling though the worlds of this game, it is up to you to solve the mysteries and find a resolution for this grim tale of horror and revenge.\nTypical of all the \"Myst\" games, the plot is pretty minimal.  It serves primary to provide the player with continuity while solving the many ingenious puzzles.  As always, the puzzles are of a Rube Goldberg nature, made up of strange contraptions and countless smaller puzzles.  \"The Exile\" exercises some restraint, so most of these challenges can be solved by a great deal of wandering around, careful observation and some good guesses.\nTo make up for what is essential a very calm, non-violent game, the designers have outdone themselves in creating the five worlds of \"Myst 3.\"  The artwork and scale are magnificent.  The animation is equally incredible.  This is the first time that I felt my 19-inch monitor was just too small.  Hopefully they will make some game posters.  I was continually being astonished by the imagination used in creating these worlds and their workings.  This is the best pure puzzle game I've seen in a long time and is well worth purchasing.", "summary": "Trouble in Tomahna", "unixReviewTime": 989712000}

I've edited the list below to include others I've seen around the 'Net:\n\n* Bi-polar spouse error. You husband/wife is completely happy, and randomly divorces you anyway.\n* Autistic child. Your child transitions from baby to kid, but stand unresponsive in the house, or just outside it, and does not react to you any more.\n* Barren! You can't have a second child, or even a first.\n* Body Snatchers! You have a second child, but when you leave the region, they disappear. The game counts them, but there is no other evidence that they existed.\n* Vanishing act.  You are away on a long quest to the Tattered Spire (spoiler!) and when you return your spouse is missing/dead and yet still married to you. You can't reuse the house to get married again.\n* Main quest plot bugged.  When you speak to the abbot at the temple of light, you can kill the main quest path by walking away too soon.  You are unable to continue the main quest before getting quite 1/3 of the way through the game.\n* Love REALLY Hurts - In the Love Hurts quest, Vincent the graveyard keeper is either floating in mid-air somewhere in the graveyard, or is standing unresponsive by a crypt. You cannot take or continue this quest to buy the graveyard mansion and resurect Lady Grey.\n* Co-op: if you co-op play with another hero in the childhood chapter you can lose everything - skills, money, items, etc.\n* The \"Jesus\" glitch - The hero is stuck in a position resembling a crucifixion victim (no really - YouTube it).\n* Rescuing Charlie - After exiting the Tomb, its very easy to run past the NPC waiting just outside for your return. Afterward, it becomes impossible to complete the quest.\n\nLionhead Studios claims that a fix for the main plot bug is in the works,  but the other bugs seriously detract from the enjoyment of the game.\n\nUPDATE: I returned my pre-ordered copy to Amazon for a full refund. I'm glad Amazon has that service for defective software, because the number of bugs in this title was inexcusable. I know several people who bought it elsewhere and could not get a full refund from wherever they bought it because it was opened software.\n\n-------------------\n\nLike Fable, Fable 2 starts you off as a child, already making decisions that will affect your personality. Fable 2 seems to have wider consequences, such as decisions you make in childhood affecting the neighborhood that you grew up in later on in the game. You really don't have a choice about taking the dog with you - it was a plot mechanism built into the game and while unique and interesting, was kinda un-necessary, except to dig up treasure, which you did by yourself in the first game.\n\nThe game is rated M for Mature, and parents who are not prepared to have deep discussions on weighty matters with younger children should take it seriously. The first time I dug up buried treasure I got a condom and some chocolate!\n\nAs other reviews noted, the controls are less intuitive, and while not a show-stopper, made for annoyances like getting stuck behind boxes that I had just walked past during one quest.  The completely good outcome was to avoid damaging the boxes, however I had to destroy two just to get out of the room. You also get hung up on people and your own dog often. Fable 1 had less of a problem, with villagers pushing easily out of the way and not causing any problem at all.\n\nAnd this is perhaps a pet peeve, but I want to slap the guy who thought to equate eating tofu with Purity and meat with Corruption, two personality values in the game that affect your character. You get an achievement if you kick the snot out of the chickens, but you're corrupt/evil if you eat them. :D\n\nYou can buy and sell houses and shops in Fable 2, just about any of them in a town. Some buildings have temporary affects on your character when you sleep there.  The first house I bought made me appear evil to villagers.  In Fable 1 you could only buy a designated house in each town, and only rarely a shop. For a delicious twist, you can drive the economy of the town up or down, affecting real estate prices... and nothing drives a house value down faster than the previous owner having an ... uhm... accident... yeah... it was an accident.\n\nAll these are just side dishes to the real plot which involves you tracking down the man who murdered your sister Rose and tried to murder you too.  Along the way you are constantly presented by choices that affect your morality and personality and how others react and events further into the game. The demon doors have also returned, and you must fulfill the wish of each of the doors before you can get to the treasures beyond.\n\nThe dog is an interesting addition, and being a dog owner I can tell you the realistic whining reaction of the dog frightened by events did have an  effect on me.  I had to constantly reassure the dog after every fight, and his growling at nearby unseen enemies was helpful, but not entirely necessary since the music changes when there is a potential threat nearby.  Maybe after he levels up a bit, I'll find him more useful.\n\nThe fight system is still nice, and the leveling system as well, with you earning points for different classes of skills (Strength, Will and Skill) based on what you use most often in combat, along with a pool of general experience for completing quests that you can use in any category.  In fights you can fluidly move between ranged, magic or melee combat with ease, and combine all three for a truly unscripted fight experience instead of being forced to use only the skillset available to your class like classic RPGs do.\n\nIf you got, or get, Pub Games for the XBOX Live arcade, you can merge your hero with your Pub Games patron and use the gold earned by your patron in Fable 2. Basically, I started the game with 80,000 gold. Houses, shops and stalls start anywhere from several hundred and go to several thousand gold depending on occupancy, local economy, and how many owners met with an untimely demise. Renting a house out, or buying a business will earn you a constant flow of money. It's small but adds up over time, since the flow of money goes by the clock on your system, not actual game-play time.\n\nThere are mini games you can play to earn money.  You can take jobs in towns, which are posted near the blacksmith or houses or inns and you have to hit the A button when the cursor is in a small green range to perform successfully. My main complaint is that these jobs are basically the same - you do the same thing clicking the button and it's called either woodcutting or blacksmithing, and therefore very repetitive. The longer the chain of successful clicks, the higher your salary multiplier gets and the faster you advance in the job. There are other jobs for good or evil inclined characters which are less boring and more like mini quests, which I prefer.\n\nBy advancing in a job, you gain bonuses in the reactions people have with your character and strength stats increase your ability to perform these jobs well.\n\nAs in Fable 1, you can get married, repeatedly if you like, and if evil, sacrifice your spouse and others for your own cruel benefit at the Wheel of Misfortune. You can also have children, and must keep your family well provided for to make them happy, furnishing your home and giving them a budget for living expenses. Taking on another family, makes them not happy, so bigamy is not as easy as it was in Fable 1. A happy family often gives you gifts when you return home from your adventures, so there is a benefit to keeping a happy family.\n\nIn all, I like the game. The graphics are beautiful, and the environment detailed, but am disappointed that things like character movement have been made less pleasant than the original, and the whole tofu = good, meat = bad stupidity. I was really looking forward to this game, but it isn't quite as nice as I hoped it would be.  It is still the most detailed role playing game environment as far as character development is concerned.\n\nSome of these are trappings, that are perhaps not necessary to resolving the main plot, but are nice for those like me who want to enjoy the scenic route.\n\nThere is a decision you make at the conclusion of the main plot that will affect how you will experience any remaining quests. But then this game is all about choices.", "summary": "Fable 2 - Like Fable 1, but with more GLITCHES", "unixReviewTime": 1224720000}

After this, we ended up becoming really good friends. I went out and bought this game a few months later, and it was always in my Playstation.\nNow, onto the game. Sure, the graphics aren't as good as the SmackDown! games for PS2, but for Playstation, they're pretty damn good. You've got tons of Exhibition mode matches. Singles, tag team, hardcore, anywhere fall, handicap, King of the Ring, Royal Rumble, survivor, and special matches. The special matches are TLC, Casket, Cage, Hell in a Cell, I Quit, Iron Man, Ladder, Special Referee, Table, and Slobber Knocker. More then enough to keep you occupied for hours! You can also have title defenses in Exhibition, something you can't do in the next three :( Also, there are over 50 superstars to choose from!\nThere's also Season mode, where you can go through the WWE, and win matches, unlocking new superstars, create parts, and more along the way.\nThen there's Create mode, one of the best things about the game! There's Create a Pay-Per-View, where you can host your own 10 match pay-per-view! The improved Create a Superstar mode gives you complete control over how you want your superstar to look, and is one of the best things about the game. You can also Create a Taunt, which allows you to create taunts for your created superstar to use. There's also Create a Stable, which allows you to form tag teams and stables, that have special entrances when they come out together.\nThe last two modes are Ranking and Belt Holder. All you can do is check who ranks where (which is determined in matches), and who holds the belt, how long they've had it, and the history of the belt.\nSo that's about all of it. By the way, once you get used to the controls, this game isn't as hard as you would think. So, if you own a Playstation, and you're a fan of wrestling, or any kind of game like this, you should buy it.

I want to add my frustrations to the growing list of lack of description and maps...\n\n1: The graphics are too Nintendo like.  HOMM4 was crisp and detailed enough for this style of game.  The new graphics make me think im playing the gamecube and not my PC.  The cut scene graphics are very stale.  Given the high horsepower requirements for this game and the animations in combat, the cut scenes could have a bit more going on.  (example, you hear the voices of the people talking, but their mouths never move)\n\n2: The game cheats.  Ok all strategy video games cheat as the computer doesnt have to follow all the same rules the player does.  However they need to set some limits on things.  For example the final scenario in campaign 1 you need to over throw the dark tower, but first you must clear out a gateway.  usually not a problem, but this one is manned pretty well.  Obvious solution is to build a bigger army.  I probably spent a game month building what I thought would be a devistating army.  I faced the gate with 12 archangles lots of cavliers and knights and so on.  The computer had 1000 devils, 3000 sucubuss like createus and so on and so on. There is no way the computer could have generated that many units out of its town.  I know in past version of HOMM unit stacks would increase over time, but this seems to have increased exponentually.  Thus the scenario was made unplayable, and needed to be restarted.\n\n3: Removal of the best parts of HOMM 4.  They took out the caravan and free movement of units.  I thought these were great features.  Now i need a hero to baby sit units being moved to the front line while my main heroes are battling it out.\n\nI guess Im missing the need to remake HOMM 3 again.  I've stopped playing the game and probably won't pick it up again.  It is not that repeat playable in its current configuration and offers no value for my money.", "summary": "Stick with HOMM3 or 4", "unixReviewTime": 1153094400}

Such a  nice game with such terrible woes. Where to start?\n\nWhat of these Throwable Bottles? In a city just lousy with loose bottles, bottles you can even knock over that even have physics, why can I only pickup and throw certain bottles and not others? Oh sirrah, what is so special of these sacred throwable bottles that makes them so much better then the HUNDREDS of bottles I can not pickup and use? Maybe it's that you can only ever carry one of these MAGICALLY bottles at a time? Their power is just TOO GREAT for the likes of any mortal to carry around more then one? I know their rarity is certain, as they are as hard to come by as they are to use right, often failing to attract attention or immediately driving your enemy to an unwanted frenzy.\n\nAnd then there's the fair city itself. Never has such a maze of blocked passages and pointless corridors ever confounded a player thusly. Every turn seems to be a dead end, and no mercy is given to the poor blackhand who attempts to transgress them. Windows become important portals to access certain parts of the city, but what windows you might ask? At last, sirrah, none shall know, as they aren't marked or given any indication when they might lead you to another part of the city, or simply to some random room. And once you start opening them, you *WILL* finish opening them, as you can not escape the opening animation no matter what you try.\n\nBut, you gasp, surely the automap would help guide the eager traveler to their destination? At last, no such solace exists, for the automap simply tells you the direction, not the path. And in a city of endless dead-ends and countless unmarked window paths, the mere direction is of little help. Prepare memorize an entire city, or be cast to the shadows to endless wander.\n\nStill, sirrah, I must say that the game is enjoyable. The shear glee one derives from meeting one's blackjack violently to the head of an unsuspecting guard is pure joy, and the endless looting a wonderful delight. You can save your game before attempting a risky procedure, and there are many ways to accomplish even the simplest heist. The story is fine fair. It's not a king's delight, but a solid meal. And the atmosphere is a splendidly dark delight. This is good, as you will spend many an hour lost in it. Secrets abound, although a few I would consider \"cheap\" fare. Perhaps a few clues might make sense to the game makers, but they will surely baffle anyone who hasn't worked at the company. Keep you good friend Google close at hand for those more trying of times.\n\nOverall, it's a good game for $30 or less. Perhaps a bit too much for anything more. I've invested many enjoyable hours, and caught my copy at a fair price.\n\nOr I suppose you could just steal it.

Gomez", "reviewText": "So I got this game cause I wanted to get a new game (really no games to get during the week of 10/13/13.  So I saw that Valhalla Knights 3 came out on the Vita, and I love the Vita cause it's a super PSP but with great graphics and such.  But that's not what I'm reviewing.  I'm reviewing VK3 for the Vita.  Let's get it on.\n\nGraphics:  The graphics aren't bad.  The character models are average.  The environments of the game, whether it be inside the prison, to outside the prison.  The details are pretty good and the view of the outside is gorgeous.  Back to the characters, the women in this game....my GOD THE FANSERVICE!!  The women in this game are very detail when it comes to what they look like, be it a dwarf/elf, to a halfling (they look like children so I'm not gonna say more).  Let's just say that they put a lot of effort on the females.\n\nSound:  The music is pretty awesome.  Motoi Sakuraba, the guy behind the Tales of games and Baten Kaitos (two of my favorite JRPGs series besides Final Fantasy) really outdid himself again in this game.  Next, the character voices.  Most of them are grunts, small dialogs like, \"Let me help you\" or \"WHAT!?\" and such.  The attack sounds are pretty bleh.  The slash sounds feel like they are taken from other games and aren't that great sounding.\n\nStory:  There is a story to the game.  Basically, you are an agent trying to find a treasure that was hidden ages ago for someone and you literally get yourself captured to search the prison for the treasure.  That's in the first 30 minutes so it's really not a spoiler in the game.  You'll meet a lot of characters (most of them are forgettable and I'm only 3 hours into the game at the moment).\n\nGameplay: On to the important part of the game.  The game is basically a quest game like its predecessors.  Get a quest, do it, get paid.  But getting a quest is different...\nYou have to pay a woman (different types of races) from 200-700 gold, and then you get to sit down with them.  This is the same with buying/selling/identifying items to changing your character's looks, to getting quests.  It's a weird feature, but...it works somewhat?  Now, when you give a certain amount of money to her, you get to activate what the game calls SEXY TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nSexy Time is a small mode with the girls that allows you to literally touch her (it's just exclamation marks) and can kiss her if she asks.  I have NO CLUE how to do this at the moment as I fail when I have to kiss them.  But I'll assume I'll know how to do this when I play the game more.  All the girls will eventually fall for you and can join you on your quest.\nEnough about Sexy Time, now on to the battles.  The battles are so-so.  You can recruit up to 5 more characters in your team and can have them all join you on your quests.  Enemies are on screen and you can attack them from behind and maybe get some bonus experience.  If you attack them and don't succeed in killing them, they'll call on others to help them out and you'll be in a small arena.  Kill them and you get experience and can search their bodies for money or items.  Bosses can be really tough, but can be beat with grinding for money with the quests.\n\nValhalla Knights 3 is an average game.  It's not a bad game, but not a great game.  At this time, it's not worth the $39.99, but feels like it's worth $20-25.  I love XSeed Games for many of their releases, but this one wasn't one of their greats.  Buy this game, but don't be surprised if you don't like the price it's at right now.......now if you'll excuse me, I'm in the mood for some SEXY TIME with the ladies!!!!!", "summary": "Average game for the average gamer", "unixReviewTime": 1382227200}

The melee is very similar to the Batman Arkham games, which allows for parries and counters. Going into a melee situation without a plan will cost you your life in many cases.

So I'm just being stubborn. Also I still feel I'd wait till it's patched. I was under impressed by the lack of polish for a game that was delayed so many times.\n\nThe game feels like if infamous second son game play and the order 1886 made a baby. Yes I know those are both PlayStation exclusive in reference to a Xbox exclusive, but so it goes I own both systems.\n\nAs for the \"glitchy\" part of the game refer to the review below. But the games honestly better after it starts moving. The opening is by far the worse part visually and overall design considering it has AI partners act as your guides for the first chapter... Which is always boring and or overly controlled.  When the main dude is standing still the world looks amazing... The problem is when it moves. The game uses a forced pixel count to generate a higher looking resolution then it really has which causes ghosting. In combat I can barely notice since I'm jumping about so much, but in the slower parts it's way in your face with some people looking like flash going at 1 mile an hour. The game is definitely pushin the Xbox one further then it can handle while retaining a constant 30fps. Oddly cause of the technique they use to make it look better it causes it to look worse in the frame rate department.\n\nThe story is ok... I wouldn't say it's bad or good. Doesn't make me think about time travel in any impressive way like steins gate (ps vita exclusive) or make me care for the characters in any special way. The main character jack is as boring as they come, honestly the only interesting character is Paul the bad guy since he actually has motivation. Also the tv show that is said to follow the bad guys really follows some random people that get pulled into the resistance... So more mistaken good guys. No fun.\n\nCombat is fun, doesn't feel like a button mess and with good timing combos of powers can be shot off quite fun. Most baddies can be dealt with any style. There are a few bosses though that only have one way to beat them and it takes away from the fun.\n\nThe other part of game play is playing the main bad guy and choosing how different situations are handled. The changes have been slight at best, more effecting the side stories of the tv show then the main game considering I been trying my hardest to make the main characters life difficult and nothing has changed.\n\nNow the elephant in the room... The game has 20 minute tv episodes between each act. 4 total.  They are completely non active.  But slippable! And they aren't pinical to the story but give each section of game play a little more filler. The problem is how do you watch tv? I watch tv shows by putting on Netflix and then popping on my computer and surfing the web or playing games on my vita. I don't sit still and watch tv... So when my video game asks me to sit still and watch a show that's only semi entertaining I space out. When I go through the game again I'll probably just skip them. I will say one thing for them they are a true show of remedies talent for pacing. As soon as the drag of doing the same same comes over me, a episode starts and I go off to make food or if it's night time get ready for my night time internet searchings. Also just something annoying is the episodes are streamed so plan on some buffering or downloading the entire episodes catalog. 75gb.\n\nGLITCHY PART: this is the one that annoyed me enough to originally give the game a 1 star. It's after Jake learns to hold a gun the first time and busts open a door to kill two guys just standing there in a lab. After that the brother  AI guide should put in his code to make it so the door can open. In my game he just stood there startled doing nothing. I tried to reload the check point and finally was forced to replay the whole chapter, watch all the boring videos again to simply get him to punch in his code. And yes fan boys there is a part that he is needed to open a door actually he's needed for most of them since if he can't make it to the door the open icon won't trigger. Trust me I replayed this part a good few times. Did it warrant a 1 star... For a AAA game I expected better. Reminded me of resident evil 6... That said after the brother is taken out of the picture with a gun to the head there aren't really any AI partners to be annoyed by and most door or sequence triggers work fine. Will I keep my score a 1 star, honestly yes.", "summary": "Glitchy The Order 1886 remake", "unixReviewTime": 1459814400}

The quality of finish on this device is truly spectacular...I was truly mesmerized at the detail. That being said....the looks are  one thing...how about how it works? The functionality and smooth movement I have lets me extend myself within the mouse pointer. Where every detail is my own and every gesture on purpose. Functionality, 10 programmable buttons, need I say more. For gammers this is match made in heaven, especially when on a Windows operating system. You have the full function and capacity of this magnificent beast at you finger tips. Including is a Mini CD where you can use a Windows device to configure all you functions and keys. If you on a Mac OS, you will need to program the mouse on a Windows computer and then be able to take full advance of your device through your Mac OS. Continuing, I immediately through this bad boy in to over drive and opened up a game of CS. I always had an excuse as to why I was playing so horribly, whether it was lag time, high ping, or just plain being bad. But I found out that it was the mouse, because as soon as I started playing some death-match, the carnage that happen on the other end of my computer was immense. I never felt so immersed in an experience while on the computer, every move, reaction, and shot fired was as if I was physically doing it and not controlling a computer. Every action was precise and on point, coinciding with every move and gesture I made, functioning in high capacity, in a swift and gratifying manner. If I had to compare this device with anything it would be something of a Porsche or Ferrari, with the exquisite detail and features, the precision of function with combined aesthetics, the 3050 Chip or engine, and the satisfaction of using it or being behind the wheel. This device is truly a beast, that's separated from the pack, and in a class of its own. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond.

You are an Arctic explorer, intent on solving the mystery of his father's disappearance some thirty years before.  Unfortunately, you've become lost and it looks as though you're going to go the same way as dear old dad.  You keep having these strange dreams.  Coming out of one (or have you?), you suddenly find the icebound hulk of a cruise ship.  When you climb on board to find shelter, you discover that the ship is the Herculania, the very vessel that your father was investigating when he was lost.\n_Morpheus_ is a great example of a breed of adventure that pretty much started with MYST and is now, unfortunately for people like me, beginning to wane a bit in prominence:  first person, point and click, atmospheric.  You might call it \"Amber on Ice;\"  like _Amber_ it involves somewhat supernatural phenomena and getting into the minds and dreams of others.  The story that is revealed as you wander about the ship--presented in QT movies--is a kind of Phantom of the Opera with a gruesome twist.  Unlike the stories in some other games, it is quite well-developed and realised, making for intriguing clues and puzzles integral to the story.  The characters are, well, mental cases, but they are believable people and (with one exception) you end up feeling sympathy for them.\nThe graphics are really quite nice, with a 360-degree view.  (My one complaint here was that though you could look around you to all sides, you could not look either up or down).  The paths that you could travel were somewhat limited, however.  In some rooms, you could, for example, only go into the corner by the desk.  There were also a lot of things I would have liked to have been able to examine more closely.  On the other hand, there were a few things that didn't seem to have any purpose.  On the whole, the look trod the edge between sparse and lush, with backgrounds beautifully rendered but not too many objects.\nAs in MYST, the puzzles are largely mechanical.  You need to make the ship work so you can figure out what's going on;  you need to gain access to locked staterooms and so on.  Later on there are some puzzles that involve acquiring inventory, but there is essentially no inventory you carry around;  you use each item pretty much where you find it.  There are no conversations and no interactions.  For me, this was great;  I prefer \"true\" puzzles to task accomplishment and mechanics to inventory.  Others might find it tedious or difficult.\nI ran this game on a brand new AMD 2800 with XP and the only real problem I had was that the mouse cursor was so extraordinarily sensitive that until I learned fine motor control I was all over the place.  Fortunately, this didn't take long.  I also had some problems with the movies:  green screens and the like.  I have heard there is a patch for this, but I couldn't find it.\n_Morpheus_ took me about 25 hours to play.  The start was slow and I wasn't sure I liked it at first.  When things started to go together, I liked it a great deal.  I was sorry to see it end, and the ending was quite abrupt!\nOverall, this is the kind of adventure game that I like.  If you're a fan of MYST an MYST-like games, you'll like this, too.", "summary": "That's What I Like!", "unixReviewTime": 1072915200}

I realize a lot of people say they don't like this game because of the platforming and repetition. Probably we could look at this game differently from all PoP series. It took some ideas from very old JRPG games - the setup, combined with new world jumping Tomb raider sort of fun and created a large open world. It's true this game has no epic fight like GoW and such but if you have played ICO you would understand some times a heart-taking story and stylish/beautiful game does not have to involve large battles. And in fact, when I played GoWIII, all I could think of is this is cool but has it been done over and over again?\n\nNow back to this game, I loved the open world (the first ACT game with a large open world for you to explore) and lighting seeds. Yes, the lighting seeds give players a purpose to dive into the dark (and later become very bright sunny) world. Some of them are tricky to get, and once you figure out how to reach them, it's pure joy.\n\nIf you are looking for a combat focused game, this is not one for you. What shines here is the massive fantastic scenery with great color and lighting, hundred thousand feet high platforms formed ruins. The world is breathtaking sometime and I have to stop playing and simply watch. If you have great imagination and enjoy a fantasy world just similar to what FF series has created, then you will surely enjoy this game like I did.\n\nI played all five prince of Persia games and this one is my favorite.", "summary": "Give this game its right justice!", "unixReviewTime": 1291075200}

Kellogg", "reviewText": "With the amount of hype that this game got, I really expected more from it. Little big planet is a platforming game centered around a small puppet called sackboy. The object is just like any other platforming game out there, you get from one end of the level to the other without dying too many times all the while you collect different things throughout the level, in this case bubbles or stickers.\n\nI'll be completely honest and tell you that I typically don't play many platform style game simply because I find them to be minimalistic and simple at best where I strive for a game that has a little more too it such as an RPG style game. This game was no different, in fact I found it to be less desirable than a normal platformer. The biggest issue I had with this game was there really was no story at all, I mean there was sackboy running around these beautiful yet oddly grotesque levels(more on that later) but really nothing else. This was an issue for me because generally because platforers typically struggle to keep my attention, I rely heavily on their storyline to keep me interested and playing the game.\nFurthermore, the controls themselves were too simplistic. There really was only the ability to move, jump and grab things it other then that, there was nothing. I wished there had been the ability to fight enemies or even the ability to double jump would have been a welcome inclusion.\n\nWhile, I admit, I was particularly fond of this game I also must say there were a couple things that I really DID like. For one, the levels were very well done. They had a style that was completely unique with the perfect blend of beauty and grotesque-ness that kept me in awe. Going along with that, everything looks surprisingly real (for lack of a better term). I was very impressed with amount of artistry that went into designing these levels.\nAnother thing that I will concede to being relatively interesting was the ability to change sackboy. Between all the costumes, stickers, colors, stamps, etc that you can get, you really have an unlimited amount of ways that you can customize sackboy and your pod which, while it was a rather minuscule part of the game for me, definitely have the game a unique aspect that I havnt seen anywhere else.\n\nOverall, this game is not one that I would buy again for myself...so why did I give it a 3 star rating? Well the reason happened as I came home from work one night. I walk up my stairs to find my wife about a foot from the tv playing littlebigplanet. I was surprised because she is notoriously picky when it comes to playing games of any type and yet she was having an absolute blast. I was further impressed when my younger cousins, nieces, and nephews came over and they all really enjoyed it. It seemed the only people who didn't enjoy this game were those who tend to consider themselves to be more than a casual gamer. So there you have it, for a more experienced gamer who likes strategy, story, skill, immersion in the game, etc I really would recommend NOT buying this game. But for the casual gamer or someone who just wants to burn a couple hours steering sackboy around various levels this game would be perfect.", "summary": "Perfect for casual gamers, but very simplistic", "unixReviewTime": 1416268800}

One of the many refinements made since the release of the original Stoked is that the gameplay feels a lot smoother and natural. Jibbing is improved, board physics are better, etc.\n\nThe graphics are quite excellent. The mountains are massive. There was already a lot to see and do in the original Stoked, but Big Air Edition adds even more things to do on every mountain and adds two brand new and huge mountains into the equation. The snow looks real, the lighting is beautiful, and just the overall presentation is impeccable.\n\nStoked: Big Air Edition is a snowboarders snowboarding game.", "summary": "A Snowboarding Game for Boarders", "unixReviewTime": 1325030400}

And while most of the games are arcade-ish, they're entertaining for anybody who does not call himself a hardcore gamer.  If you're looking for realistic, movie-like graphics, get an Xbox 360 or a PS3.  But if you want a system that people of all ages will enjoy, get a Wii.\n\nThat said, there is also a downside to the Wii.\n\nWhile the games are fun, many of them get old in a hurry.  With the exception of Mario Kart, which I'm pretty much up for playing at any time, the games I've purchased at the store have all been at least decent and I enjoy them for a week after purchase, but then they collect dust for months until I have interest in playing them again.  It would be acceptable if the games were less expensive, but dropping $40 on a game that grows old quickly is not a mistake a Wii gamer will make too many times.  I feel like I need a couple dozen games to keep me playing Wii every day.  And for that to happen, I would need to see most games at $15-20 and premium games like Madden NFL 10 at $30.\n\nMany of the games you'd like to play online, such as Wii Sports (we all think we're the best at power bowling), are not available for online play.  There are hundreds of games to purchase online inexpensively (including classics like Super Mario Bros and Tecmo Bowl), but unfortunately there is no option to try before you buy and I've regretted buying every title except the classics mentioned above and Tetris Party (you can play Tetris online).\n\nThere are many benefits to having your Wii connected to the Internet (I use my wireless signal).  In addition to being able to play and buy many games online, you can also download: Nintendo Channel, which has video clips and lots of other valuable information if you're looking to buy Wii or DS games; the Everybody Votes Channel, where you pick an answer and predict the most popular answer (i.e., \"Would you rather do dishes or laundry?\"); Internet Channel, which allows you to browse the Internet; and you can check the news and your local weather forecast.\n\nThe Wii also seems to have the least negative feedback regarding console durability and performance of any gaming console on the market.  I'm knocking on wood with one hand while I type that I've had my console for nearly one year and I've had zero freezes or other issues.\n\nWhile the Wii has its share of short-comings, the Wii is a great buy if you're looking for a family console.", "summary": "Great family console, short-lived fun", "unixReviewTime": 1250553600}

I never even watched the movie, and yet I'm loving this game.\n\nThat is what defines Batman Returns on the NES. Konami's straightforward licensed beat 'em up. If you had played Konami's TMNT II - The Arcade Game, then you know what to expect. It plays like TMNT II, but it pretty much holds up on its own, too.\n\nLove that music huh? Well, you're gonna be listening to upbeat Konami tunes throughout the game. That's what a true Konami game should have.\n\nBatman can use his weapons, like his gun and his Batarang. He can also use a slide attack by pressing A and down at the same time.\n\nThe problem with the game, though, is how you start with only one life. I guess that's why you have such a big health bar, but I still hate how you have to start with just one life. At least you can find hearts in presents, fire hydrants, or wherever else to refill the health bar.\n\nOverall, Konami has done Batman well.

The closest thing to this game that I have played is SSX 3, which I would say is a very different game from long ago. So, I'm mostly coming into this game as a FPS/RPG player.\n\nNow, knowing that background, the controls were not at first intuitive to me, and I feel like the tutorial could have done slightly better explaining. (But maybe these things are a universal standard in extreme sports games.) Initial movement was with the left stick, which was to be expected, but then I walked up to the platform, put on my wing suit, and tried to walk again. Instead I did a face plant (it's still not clear to me that you can move without diving after equipping the wing suit). After getting back up I could walk normally so I walked to the edge, and couldn't figure out how to jump off. Eventually, I figured out, I \"crashed\" and needed to hold Y to reset. So I did, and tried walking to the edge again, but instead dove face first onto the platform again. I needed to switch out of my wing suit if I wanted to make minor adjustments on my launch position, which I found tedious, and I had to figure out myself.\n\nAll the game modes themselves were pretty easy and intuitive to figure out at a casual level, but I still don't really understand many aspects. When snowboarding (which is what I did most of), I feel like things randomly kill me. The last part of the tutorial is doing tricks while sliding down through a village, so I look at the map and figure any snowy roof is a jump, but I quickly learned that going over a roof was a good way to lose all momentum or just straight up wipe out. Further, estimating how much air I am going to get in a jump seems hard for me to estimate. I'm sure that I'm just missing a feel for the game, but some jumps randomly bump you early, some randomly send you flying through the air, and some you just slide right over. Another complaint here, is that going backwards while in an event seems to be almost impossible, or I'm missing the controls for it. Multiple times, while trying to use roofs as jumps, I would lose all my momentum on the upward slanted roof. So I would try to slide back down the roof to get off and go around, but that would be going backwards and the game doesn't seem to like that during events, so instead my character sits there desperately trying to slide *up* a slant. I got stuck in this situation many times while snowboarding, and the best way to get out appears to be to jump fruitlessly at the lowest point of the ramp that it still \"forward\" to the race.\n\nThe final confusion I had with this game was scoring. All my previous experience with games like this (ssx 3, but also skate and tony hawk's pro skater) are entirely based off tricks. If this is a way to jump onto and grind a railing, it wasn't explained to me, and I haven't figured it out. Tricks seem to award points on difficulty, which makes sense, but I felt I was getting a lot more points just flying past random obstacles. Which is maybe more the point of the game, being a risk taker. But while sliding down it seemed I would just be randomly getting random amounts of points, and I couldn't figure out how to optimize points from danger zones.\n\nI've shared a few grievances, but this game was not a bad game. Almost entirely, it just seems to have a tedious barrier to entry. I'm sure most of my problems will go away with time and getting use to the game's environment, but they are problems for new players nonetheless. I think the game is unique in it's scoring for high risk over tricks, but I'm not really up to speed on other options out there.\n\nOne of the things I really enjoyed is the seamless multiplayer, as I was sliding down the village, I would see other noobs show up and stumble around and fall down the hill with me. But again, this could just be a standard for the genre at this point.\n\nThree of the game modes, snowboarding, wing suit, and skiing seem well flushed and greatly enjoyable. So far paragliding sort of feels like I'm playing a mario party mini-game.\n\nOverall, since I don't know the other options out there, I can only really recommend it on one level. To people who enjoy the extreme sports genre and want something new, I believe this will accomplish that with its combination of sports and its unique scoring for risk taking rewarding reaction game play.\n\nFor people new to the genre, this game might be more tedious and expansive than you want. I know for me, even playing this game, all I really want to do is race and do tricks on the snowboard, and for something like that I prefer games like ssx 3, which I am sure there are more recent games that play better than ssx 3 but are the same idea.\n\nOverall, I would like to give this game a 7/10, but on amazon I'm forced to round that up or down, and it's a tough decision for me, but I'm inclined to round up to 4/5 just due to the apparent uniqueness of the game.", "summary": "Initially hard to learn controls, but then a fun game", "unixReviewTime": 1482537600}

My daughter kept saying \"I want to just swim around\", but the intro stuff was so long & boring.\n\nKids who are not very good readers will need a parent sitting with them explaining things also and even good readers will not understand many of the words.\n\nThe game then tries to give you a series of tasks via your email -- to check bring up the menu, select \"return to boat\", click on the boat cabin to enter, click on the PDA, click on the email, then read.

No other sea creatures at all.  My daughter kept saying that she wanted to see sharks, dolphins, sting rays, etc.  Maybe you have to unlock cooler creatures, but why if this is mostly a free-form exploring experience?\n\nTo learn the name of a fish you must \"touch\" it repeatedly, some as many as 8 or 10 times.

In one sitting I was flipping it so fast for 5 minutes straight before it let me continue on.  No way is that good for a controller!  Because of the cinematics constantly disrupting your game, the game starts to play more like the Indigo Prophecy or Heavy Rain.  You have zombies that can \"superman\" you, which puts you in a cinematic button mash, and they constantly over-run you, with ammo being very scarce; and so is stamina which is what you need to beat them back when you are out of bullets.  That's what you expect from a survival-horror game; yet it made the game's difficulty feel cheap.  Because of how fast the enemies move, and how they can attack you, you can't just line up head shots.  With some weapons, you'll find you can easily use up a clip or two on one enemy; and you can be surrounded by 10 or more enemies at the same time.  They also don't really reward you for big boss fights.  You'll waste the boss, get the stroy to progress, but no skill points for your effort.  You sue skill points to purchase skills, which you can only purchase after completing a chapter, or from the campaign main menu.  You can only have 3 equipped at a time.  These skills are expensive compared to the amount of skill points you get, and there is at least one or two skills you need equipped at all times.  One keeps your aim steady, the other is for defense.  They made a mistake with getting rid of the old inventory system, and the weapon upgrades.  Now, essentially you have more space, but it's alloted for weapons you will pick up on the course of the campaign, and you usually have no room for health restoring items.\n\nI do like the voice acting and the story was good; but the game felt more like a chore than an activity.

I obviously have not gotten far into the game, but once you play a racer for an hour+, you've played 90% of the core features of the game, so I figure I can safely write a review for it.\n\nUnlike previous titles, there is no cinematic storyline that tells of some bad guy who hates you for some reason, and how you have to climb the ranks of some underground racers to one day best him in an epic race. Also, unlike a titles way back ago, all these races are legal and done on tracks--No intense police chases here. The basic premise here is that you start off at the bottom rung of an enormous ladder tournament that one day leads you to a world championship race with some of the most exotic cars on the planet. Sounds good, lets get racing!\n\nYou start off being put into the seat of a BMW that you only get for 1 day before you start off your career. You do a test lap and the game will offer up some suggestions on difficulty level settings (turning traction control on, ABS, etc). It did a pretty good job at guessing the settings I would have picked, so I liked that feature. You can tweak it as necessary, so this isn't a one time only thing.\n\nThe racing itself is incredible. It is a huge departure from the previous arcade style racing games that the NFS titles seemed to focus on. With max simulation on, it races like a car would race. You can't take 90 degree turns at 190 mph, you can't smash into a barrier wall at 140mph, backup and still win the race, etc. To help those of us who have a true \"need for speed\", the game does offer a racing line with speed indicators that change dynamically as you race (for example, it'll turn red as you approach a hard turn, indicating you should slow down.)\n\nThe game also has a system of style points, which you get for things such as tightly following the racing line, passing people, drafting, etc. One thing I did like is that these style points is not just for those of us who play 100% \"nice\". They have split up style points into \"precision\" and \"aggression.\" Precision points are for those who like to finesse their way to 1st (drafting, passing politely, nice cornering). Aggression points go to those like me, who basically smash their way through cars until I'm in 1st place and half the group is totaled. You can even get points for spinning people off the track! Awesome.\n\nThese points go towards winning stars, and stars increase your driver level, and increasing your driver level unlocks more cars, modifications, etc. Like I said earlier, it is a pretty large ladder system of unlocks and races. I am incredibly impressed so far with how the game feels and runs.\n\nA few final thoughts:\n\nThe interior mode of racing (which I highly recommend) puts you as if you were actually inside the car, and the details are INCREDIBLE. They really spent the time to actually copy what the car interior should look like. The BMW has the iDrive system even. Also, the graphics (when played on high) are unbelievable. There is unfortunately a significant loading time between races, but that might be because I set my settings to max on everything.\n\nAlso, it is clearly a port, because it tells me not to \"turn my system off while saving.\" When was the last time I reached for my power button to turn my computer off, mid-anything? It's not like I'm sitting there, getting impatient mid-game while it's saving ,and then flipping the switch on my surge protector and being like, I'm outta here! Oh well. Despite that, everything else runs smoothly. (I'm running it on Windows 7 and there weren't any hiccups in the install.)\n\nSo overall, I am incredibly happy with this purchase. I'm also happy to see a real racing game from the NFS guys--it's about time they get back to their roots of simulation racing. The arcade stuff was fun, but this is what I'm really interested in. If you've played NFS before, buy this title. You won't be disappointed.", "summary": "Amazing departure from the Arcade style of NFS", "unixReviewTime": 1252972800}

Not stellar by any stretch of the imagination but decent overall.\n\nLets start with the good:\nThe graphics are solid and it's evident that the developers put a good deal of time into creating a detailed, interesting and appropriate atmosphere.  The creatures you battle are creative and varied and overall the game succeeds in this category.\n\nThe voice work is above average and there are plenty of humorous comments scattered about to break up the monotony.  The soundtrack fits the game play.  You may not like heavy metal but really, what else would fit a game where you are basically destroying everything in your path?\n\nThe mechanics of the game are good when you are fighting and moving around throughout the levels, with one noted exception which I'll address later.  Make no mistake, this game is a button masher.  Yes, there are combos you can learn as you work your way through the game but they are just more button mashy goodness.\n\nA plus with the game is the ability to restore your health during battles.  This feature impacts the game significantly.  Early on it makes it practically impossible to die but as the battles get harder, you'll need it believe me.\n\nThe game is a gore fest.  I mean an arm ripping, decapitating, sick, twisted, bloody, mutilated, gore fest.  It's called Splatterhouse so what did you expect?  This is good for some I suppose but read on and see that it can be bad as well.\n\nNow onto the Not-So-Good:\nMy number one complaint about this game without a doubt is the platforming portions.  First off, they seem gimmicky and don't really fit the game overall and no, I don't care about any throw backs to previous games. Worse yet is the fact that they are fixed camera and the camera is almost always in an awkward position where you can't really see what you are doing. When you need the camera beside you, it's positioned behind you, etc.  It adds a layer of difficulty that is just irritating and completely unnecessary.  Then to make matters worse, the controls while playing these areas are not nearly as responsive as they need to be.  For example, you have to sprint past some giant something-or-other that is trying to squash you but your character keeps on running even after you release the button so you typically run into some other object that smashes you or slices you in half, etc.  Nice, lovely.  The same is true for rolling under objects too.  Jumping thankfully doesn't seem that bad but the other moves mean you'll get to play the same section over and over again.\n\nAnother issue is with the LOAD times.  They are ridiculous.  I'm not talking about load times between chapters either, I'm referring to the load times when you die. Get used to seeing the same scrawny monster load screens because they are frequent and way too long.  If you are a player that is having problems and dying a lot, who knows how many hours you'll see of the load screens.  Seriously.\n\nThe game is a gore fest.  Now, again I'm not saying that is a bad thing because it is called SPLATTERhouse but there were times when I was on a killing rampage and there was so much blood splattered all over the screen that literally I couldn't see the characters,including the enemies.  I mean, blood splattered all over the walls, ceiling and floor is fine but is it really necessary to have it completely coat the camera lens?  No, it is not.\n\nSo in summary, this game is decent, pure button mashing, mindless fun.  The kind of game you can pick up and play a bit and then move on. I wasn't expecting much in the way of storyline so I wasn't disappointed.  If you were a fan of the previous Splatterhouse games then buying this is probably a no brainer.  It is a great looking shiny upgrade to previous versions.  If you are looking for deep or complex storyline, then look elsewhere.  Personally, I think the game is worth the purchase but not at full price.  Buy it when its on sale, pick up a used copy or rent it first and see if you like it.", "summary": "Splatter Camera...", "unixReviewTime": 1294531200}

I've been using it for over 2 weeks straight with every game I have like Streets of Rage, Golden Axe, and  Altered Beast, just to name a few. As anyone who's played those games know, they are button masher's. I've also been using it on 32X games and it has been working flawlessly.\n\nI also have a habit of dropping controllers and this has handled that like a champ as well. I have not had one problem with button presses being recognized by any game or the Directional pad not working right. The cord is the same length as my original controller's. The buttons do feel slightly more stiff but I'm not sure if that's because the controller is new and my original controller is over 20 years old or what exactly but they are no more stiff that an XBOX 360 or XBOX One controller's buttons.\n\nI definitely recommend this for Genesis players that want a good replacement controller and don't want to spend a lot of money on beat up original. I would include a pic but someone already did showing how it compares to an original controller, so there is really no point.

I mean this is the ultimate way to end the Super NES's fantastic run.  An RPG that sums up everything in the mid 90's that made the genre so memorable and unique compared to say, the typical run 'n gun, Disney games and tournament fighters that dominated the video game market at the time.\n\nWhat I'm about to say will probably blow your mind.  The first 5 or 6 hours of Terranigma is honestly the greatest moment of beauty I've ever felt in an RPG.  You can tell a lot of careful writing and dedication was involved in making the game feel larger than life.  I mean the way the landscapes change, the dramatic emotionally-driven music that enhances the experience, the thick noticeable atmosphere, the slowness whenever something significant happens to allow the tension to build... this game does it all.\n\nThe storyline mainly focuses on evolution and resurrections of the human race explained in perhaps the easiest way you could ever imagine, which means it makes sense at least 80% of the time.  Hey that's a high number!  Usually such storylines go way over my head due to my short attention span.  Terranigma gets it right.  Throughout the game you will visit mountainous areas, winter wilderness with snowy fields, stench-filled sewers, several elegant castles the likes of which you'd see in any Square RPG (yes I'm aware this game was made by Enix but the similarities are definitely there), several different towns and a LOT more.  When I say this game is gigantic, well, if you appreciate the Super NES generation, you'll immediately be blown away by everything this game has to offer.  It can literally take weeks to absorb everything even if you were to play Terranigma several hours a day.\n\nPerhaps if there's any flaws with the storytelling, it's that there tends to be several characters we need to keep track of throughout this lengthy tale with an expectation we should remember everybody we meet because they'll end up being important in some way later on.  There does reach a point (when you visit a character by the name of Wong in an Asian village) when all the characters clash and it can become overwhelming to the point you lose track of who's talking to who and it all becomes a bit jumbled and confusing temporarily.  That's the secret to this games success- confusing moments happen briefly before shifting back into an understandable direction.  Amazing!  It doesn't help that the dialogue box only mentions a characters name when they first start a conversation- as you keep reading through these discussions you often get the characters confused.  Princess Elle's story never really made sense to me to be honest, even though I understand there's a good light world and a bad dark world with mirrored characters.  Luckily for the most part the good and bad characters remain separate so you know what's going on, but with Elle it can get confusing sometimes.\n\nAnyway did I mention the character you play as, Ark, is a brave little man?  He will face hardships time and time again, along with going on fetch quests such as delivering letters and items depending on the errands the townspeople ask of Ark.  We're talking a LOT of errands.  This, along with spending time leveling up Ark so he has enough strength and experience to continue forward and defeat the eventual bosses, is what makes the game so long.  However you really only find yourself slicing away at the same bad guys over and over on a few occasions to gain enough strength.  For the most part the enemy variety is rich and plentiful enough that you'll level up simply by taking your time and killing the enemies you stumble upon.\n\nYou can travel on a map screen by way of walking on foot, riding a bird, taking a boat and later on uniquely taking an airplane.  I love how you can see the detailed map you're walking on and I'm especially blown away by how HUGE it is.  This is a Super NES game we're talking about here.  Games on Super NES cartridges shouldn't be *this* big, haha!\n\nThe music is memorable but there's one particular theme (such as when the lion attacks the girl later on) that repeats WAY too many times, and it's easily the worst theme in the game the way it blares the same 3 notes obnoxiously loud over and over.  The rest of the music in the game however is *extremely* good.  A bunch of lullaby/somber melodies make up a huge chunk of the music you'll hear on your adventure for world peace.  However there's also fast-paced music that sounds sweeping and whimsical such as the forest/lake areas, and I absolutely LOVE the lab music.  It's so trippy with heavy bass and lots of melody.\n\nThe combat itself is really smooth and your character is pretty fast on feet.  You won't have any trouble with the controls, or feel overwhelmed by surrounding danger because the game plays remarkably clean and spectacularly in this regard.  Any skeleton, slime or animal creatures (just to name a few) are always spaced apart in such a way to allow the gamer time to respond accordingly.  This and the fact you can keep slashing the same enemies over and over to level up actually makes the game quite easy but Terranigma is all about its magnificent story the way it should be, so challenge doesn't even really matter in this case (and I almost NEVER say challenge doesn't matter so you know this game lured me in pretty darn good!)\n\nHowever as magnificent and often dark as the story is, I do have to question if all the history lessons are really necessary.  We meet Christopher Columbus who takes up a good chunk of the story concerning his discoveries and adventures.  We also visit towns folks who are coming out with new inventions such as telephones, airplanes, electricity, etc.  This occasionally can make the game feel more like a cheesy children's story at times with a twist in that the fantasy folklore-style storytelling radically changes the way history really unfolded of course, which is intended to tell a quality video game story.  I have mixed feelings about taking historic facts and combining them with fantasy however.  I think I'd have rather everything been *completely* fantasy for the purpose of a video game, but it's not a big deal or anything.  These segments are always well told, good-hearted and memorable.\n\nAnd WOW.  You want to talk about an RPG with twists and turns and a real emotional rollercoaster ride?  Look no further than the women and men our hero Ark has discussions with and how they have this way of always feeling significant in some way, which can get really personal and in-depth at times which is absolutely staggering for a Super NES game.  These conversations are WAY more impactful and better written than the stuff this is usually compared to from Illusion of Gaia (and by the way, is Terranigma an official sequel or are people just making comparisons and calling it a sequel?)\n\nSo why wasn't this game released in the states?  Well besides the reasons I mention above how RPG's weren't the most popular video games on the market in the mid 90's (at least not in my neighborhood- we were all soaking up Mortal Kombat fatalities at the time, heh) I have to worry if a couple really dark moments later on such as the disturbing one involving one of the female characters and a baby is the culprit behind this.  This particular segment is absolutely *intense* in how sad and shocking it is for a Nintendo game.  I can't reveal what happens exactly.  If I do have one wish it's that I wish the detailed storytelling and the heavy unforgettable atmosphere of the first 6 hours of the game where Ark goes around talking to wild animals had remained the focal point in the second half.  Once the story switches to castles, princesses and getting familiar with townspeople and discussing inventions, the adventure slightly loses its distinctive edge.  Small complaint though.\n\nFind a way to play Terranigma even if RPG's aren't your favorite genre.  This game put the icing on the Super NES's final cake.

It would be wonderful if you could 'buy' a hint screen towards the end that at least showed you what scene you had hidden puzzles left in!\n\nA lot of the puzzles are a bit repetitive (there are several 'pitcher' and 'chess' and 'sliding puzzle' ones) and some are a little tricky and a pit finicky, but with perseverance (and an occasional hint!) it's easy enough to work your way through the whole game.\n\nI have to admit, if the plot were a book I might call it predictable, but as a backdrop to a game it was fun and worked well.  And guessing the ending is just another part of the fun!\n\nEvidently they're making a sequel, and I will be first in line to buy it.

However, its slightly wider-than-normal body may turn off some people.\n\nWider - isn't that bad?\nActually, depending on how large your hand is, and how you like to hold your mouse; the G600 won't be a big difference to most people. The mouse I previously used was a Logitech G9  mouse, and initially the G600's wider body felt a bit weird in my hand. But after a few hours of my favorite PC games, I had gotten used to it. The G600 is designed for the typical \"palm\" grip that most users seem to use - including myself. That is to say, that the index and middle fingers of my hand make complete contact with the mouse. Each finger rests completely on one of the two main click-buttons (left and right click) . This also means that the palm of my hand is comfortably encompassing the base of the mouse as well.  If you're a claw-grip user (where your fingers are arched so that only your fingertips touch the mouse), this mouse my not be for you. That's because of the width of the mouse may be too wide to comfortably manipulate using the claw-grip.\n\nButtons galore\nThe G600 has 12 buttons on its side, along with a tilt wheel (it clicks left and right in addition to clicking down and scrolling), a shift button, two top buttons, and the two standard left and right click buttons. So that makes a total of 20 seperate functional inputs on the mouse. And when you press the shift button, it doubles the functionality of the sides buttons and the two top buttons - making for a total of 33 or functional inputs for this mouse. (If you don't change the standard Windows buttons, it's more like 28.)\n\nToo many Buttons?\nYou'd think that having 12 buttons on the side of this mouse would make it impossible to press the desired button without looking at the mouse constantly. Surprisingly, this is not the case. That's because the buttons are grouped into two sets of \"resting points\" for your thumb. When you have your thumb resting in one of these button groups, you can easily feel the individual buttons. It works  well. I use these buttons constantly when playing MMOs. It makes marking targets for my party members so much easier. And with so many buttons at my disposal, it's easy to assign most my attacks/abilities to them.\n\nCustomization\nThe G600's software is very easy to use. The mouse has 3 modes of settings by default. The default setting is aimed at MMO games where several commonly used functions are already mapped to several of the buttons already. Likewise, the other 2 modes are aimed at FPS games, and general gaming. Every button can be customized, and in every of the 3 modes. What's more, you can change the colored LED lighting of the keys to anything you wish. You can even change the lights to pulse and cycle between colors.\n\nCompared to the Razer Naga\nI've used the Razer Naga, and it's a very good mouse. Like the Logitech G600, it also has 12 side buttons. However, I had to look at it often in order to press the right button. The G600 on the other hand, is so much easier to use because its buttons are laid out in their two \"resting\" points. It only took me about a day to get accustomed to. I would highly recommend this mouse to anyone who plays MMO games. It's comfortable, it's got two big teflon pads underneath it for very smooth operation, and it's plethora of functions will appeal to any MMO gamer.", "summary": "Great for MMO games, but maybe not for \"claw-grip\" users", "unixReviewTime": 1380672000}

I am gonna simply talk bout what features I like best bout this system I own all three now I have different reasons why I like each one. First off bluray  being able to watch great movies in high def makes this a must have and seeing it has wi-fi internet connection means firmware updates which makes this the best way to get a bluray player but also bonus you can play games too that way. There is wide array of games to choose from for this system . The graphics are outta this world. The price is steep but in our world you get what you pay. You get something that can browse the net, play games, watch high definiton movies. dvds, listen to music on. The new playstation home is something new they added a fun cool new way to interact with friends kinda similar to imvu where you get a 3d avatar to represent yourself. With all sorts of games to choose from and assortments of bluray players you get a bargain when You do buy . Mine is the 40g model but is big enough for what I will be needing it for plus if you want the HDD is upgradeable. The con to this machine is the price but thats the only con it seems to have in the long run you get a savings on this cause your getting both a bluray player and a new generation gaming console. Plus the built in wi-fi unlike the xbox you gotta buy a separate thing which is no biggie there but still. Be nice if they would of put wi-fi inside that. Overall this is a good console and too I see they got a rather good library so far and continuing to grow new games best ones coming out will probably be on the ps3 no doubt bout it. I recommend you get a hdtv first though what the difference it makes and then buy this. You can get hdtvs now at walmart for under 300 small screen but great enough for a bedroom or what not if thats what you intend to use this on.", "summary": "Awesome", "unixReviewTime": 1231372800}

However, Rubi will automatically jump/roll/maneuver over most obstacles.  Jumping is really only used for getting yourself airborne to slow things down a bit whilst gunning down the throngs of enemies being thrown your way.  While you'd think this wouldn't be an issue, it took me a bit to get used to not actually having to jump to get up to that ledge.  And if you press \"A\" to jump to get on top of a crate, you end up performing the jump animation without actually getting anywhere, as your jump command, and the game's automatic jump response clash.  Solution to this, of course, is simple mental conditioning (i.e., \"Don't press the 'A' button, dummy.\").\n\nAnd in reference to the latter part: at some points in the game, Rubi will die from the smallest offenders.  For example, you can do these crazy rolls and dives and what have you, but if you fall ten feet from a rafter to the floor below, you'll die.  Logically, it just doesn't make any sense.  Though I suppose applying logic to a game like this is folly in and of itself.  Still, just one of my personal frustrations.\n\nThe developers have done really well with how bullet time is handled, though, I think.  Unlike most games that utilize this particular gimmick that has you going and recharging some sort of bullet time gauge, WET allows you to slow down the action whenever your feet are off the ground, and a round is leaving the chamber.  And throughout a lot of the game, you need it.\n\nOn another note, I'm glad that the boss fights--what few there are--are done, for the most part, by just pressing buttons in responses to prompts shown on screen.  I can't really think of how you, as a player, could appropriately dispatch characters that've been established as being a bit larger than life within the boundaries of the game.  For example, Tarantula is a pretty mysterious femme fatale, so to be able to kill her by just hacking at her with your sword would be a bit anti-climactic, I think.\n\nGraphics - 5/5\nGraphically, I think the game is just beautiful.  Playing it on my 42\" HDTV--even though it's not a top-o'-the-line 120hz, or even 1080p--is just gorgeous.  There was definitely a lot of time spent in the details here.  Textures are well done, and when you kick into rage mode, it's just entirely too much fun.\n\nAudio - 5/5\nOnly one real complaint here, and it's when Rubi goes and grunts as she lifts herself up to the next higher ledge.  Just seems like Eliza put a bit too much effort into it, and it comes off sounding either awkward, hilarious, or a combination of the two.  That aside, the voice acting is quite top notch, and done by some of the more notable voice actors out there: Ian McDowell, James Sie, and Alan Cumming, to name a few.  But it's the music that really adds to the atmosphere of the game, and the game's musical score meshes perfectly with the tracks contributed by the various musical groups that chipped in to the project.\n\nReplayability - 4/5\nHonestly, there's only so much that you can do in a game like this.  It's completely linear, and there's no way that you can do things any differently.  Yes, you can go through and vow to do nothing but gun down your enemies, or slash them, or do wall-running shots, or this, that, or the other, but inevitably, all you have is the game's core objectives.  And unless you're really big into your Gamerscore, or you really want to see more concept work, once you defeat the game on normal difficulty (which is about six or seven hours, just grinding away at Story Mode), there's really no reason to come back and play more.  Not to say that you won't, because again, the game IS fun.  Just not very rewarding for what effort you pour into it.\n\nOverall - 4/5\nAs I've said, WET is a fun game.  It's very over-the-top, but still quite engaging.  The story is very well done, audio is pristine, and graphics are crisp.  Aside from a few mechanical issues, gameplay is a breeze.  I'd recommend that you at least play the demo, as it gives you an excellent taste of what you get in the full version.", "summary": "Definitely Entertaining", "unixReviewTime": 1253923200}

Playing as 'ol shellhead, you take down wave after wave of baddies, with an occasional boss battle thrown in now and then for good measure.  Naturally, what kills Iron Man is the fact that the game as a whole is a tedious bore.  You have objectives, you take down the bad guys, etc, etc.  The whole game is just so repetitive that it pretty much kills anything good about it.  Combine this with some frustrating controls and disappointing graphics (and some just plain awful cut-scenes), and you get what we have here.  There are some good points to be found, including the fact that the moments of flying around are pretty okay, there's unlockable extra armors, and film stars Robert Downey Jr. and Terrance Howard provide their own voices as well.

The graphics and animation are a slight improvement over last year's game, but aren't very noticeable unless you play this version right after playing last year's version.

Beautiful graphics, an interesting story and the controls were great - I learned more about the sixaxis controller and how to manuever along with some of the other cool things about it.  Pretty interactive.  And to top it all off, the scenes and fighting so many enemies at ones was really neat too.\n\nI can't talk too much about the story, since it's been discussed & I don't want to give it all away.  But it's really about a small clan fighting for their own existence against a tyrannical ruler who becomes obsessed with obtaining the 'Heavenly Sword', that's in their posession.  You fight as \"Nariko\" and \"Kai\", an orphaned girl adept at archery, on their journey to fight the ruler & protect their comrades & the sword. The controls for the game are exceptionally well as you can execute a wide range of special attacks, some working better on other enemies.  And the QTE's were also challenging, although the responsiveness was suspect at times.  The music and score to this was fantastic as well, fitting in with the cinema of the game.  And on closer look, it was actually done by world renown artist and producer Nitin Sawhney.  The voice for Nariko in the English version of the game reminded me, actually, of Peta Wilson (Le femme Nikita).  But then looking it up, it's actually Anna Torv (from tv series \"Fringe\").\n\nI liked it.  I can see why some people can compare it to God of War.  It's hard to really rate it compared to that franchise & I enjoyed it best based on it's own merit.  But if this is just a taste of what the PS3 can do, I'm really looking forward to seeing the new G.O.W. more than ever - it promises to be absolutely epic!  And some people complained about the length and they do have a point.  If you're a serious gamer you'll probably finish it relatively quickly & if you drop all the dough for it and want a longer, more drawn out game, you may be disappointed there.

With Pokemon Black and White 2, we did the same thing, and I'm impressed with how much more fun they've made the sequel.  You don't have to have played the first Black or White to figure out the game, but if you have, it's interesting to see how very much the Unova Region (the game's setting) has changed.  You will see familiar places and new ones--even the starting city is totally different!  But also White 2 and Black 2 have added a lot more of the older Pokemon for you to find beyond the ones that were in the first Black or White games--and there is also  Therian Tornadus, Thundurus, and Landorus (I only found a Thundurus in the first Pokemon White, but it was fun to catch him!).\n\nIf you're new to Pokemon, the shortest way I could explain it is that you are a young person in a land where many different kinds of creatures exist in the wild called 'Pokemon'. These creatures can be captured and cared for, and for many children this is a kind of rite of passage: you learn how to capture and train Pokemon, travel the land on your own, and have adventures. You use your Pokemon to have battles, against other trainers and against wild Pokemon. If it sounds a bit cruel, keep in mind that this is a game for young people and as such Game Freak goes out of their way to make the story a positive lesson: you have to take care of your Pokemon, they grow to like you, and no one ever dies--they just 'faint' and can be revived. Some creatures can 'evolve' into different forms, and that adds to your options and makes the possibilities even more diverse.\n\nIf you're contemplating buying a Pokmon game for a child in your family, there is educational value to be had here: I'm amazed at the huge and creative variety of creatures, and my daughter has coached me on strategies: type matching and analysis are important skills that require memorization, reasoning, and a bit of basic math. You have to manage money to buy things and plan your inventory before taking a trip out of town. And sometimes your character is asked questions to make them think.\n\nThere are changes to the storyline that make the main story mode go by a bit quicker--but this is okay because finishing the main story is just the beginning with this game!  My daughter and I have both logged time wandering around the world of the original Black and White and we expect to do the same for the sequel.  Although the concept is still, \"Go to a place, explore it, find the gym leader and beat them to move on\", the people at Game Freak have tried to change it up a bit.  For example, in the third town you travel to there's a movie studio, and you can spend all the time you like \"making movies\".  The \"make a movie\" game play is the same as a Pokemon battle, but with a script, dialogue choices, and 'actors', and the battles (which take place on a green-screen sound stage/motion capture facility) get woven into the story.  You get to go watch your movies in the town's theater and see the audience's reaction.  Where the first game had stage shows and dress-up, this section was a more entertaining twist that offers a lot of movie types and variations in replay (and there are other add-ons to the core game as you go further).  There is also a Medal Box that keeps track of various 'achievements', such as completing so many steps in a day, etc.  This isn't required, but it's an entertaining add-on.  There is a \"Nearby\" feature that's designed to let you do certain things with other players who are close by...but to be honest, I can't imagine either of us having many opportunities to do that.  We just don't live somewhere that would be likely to have a lot of DSi/3DS players all playing Pokemon Black/White 2 with C-Gear enabled at the same time.\n\nIf you liked Pokemon Black or White, you'll enjoy the sequel.  Some of it is familiar and some new, but overall it feels as if the game has been improved to not only give you more to do, but increase the variety (and frequency) of different Pokemon being available to you.

It's not a shooter or an action game, it's a game about running and jumping across rooftops to uncover information.  If you approach it from this perspective, this game is absolutely fantastic.  It is a little on the short side but there are speedruns, time trials, and online competing via racing people's ghosts that will help keep you playing after the story mode is over and done with.\n\nThe levels are creative and despite the genre you never really feel like you're being railroaded along one set path.  Things look and feel open and the game does a good job of making you feel like you have some control over where you go, even though this isn't really the case.  The platforming puzzles are a little difficult and you will definitely have moments where you fall to your death due to a poor jump, but once you've completed them they feel really satisfying.\n\nThe pacing is good.  Each level has platforming areas where you can take your time and then one or two areas where there are people shooting at you and you have to get away.  These can be a little hectic, especially if you choose to fight your way out, but after a couple tries you'll either have a tactic for that fight or you'll have figured out the best way to get away from the enemies.  If you're short of patience the game will become frustrating as I can guarantee that you will have to re-try a couple of areas, but if you're willing to fail and try something a few times then the game keeps going.\n\nThe camera movements are very impressive and feel accurate to the movement that the character has.  One of the first things I noticed was how fluid the movements felt once you had momentum going - it helps immersion and keeps you within the game much more.\n\nOverall I'd highly recommend the product.  The controls take a little getting used to but after the first chapter you will have it down.  The game will take around 8-10 hours to complete the story but the experience is unique and FUN, something which seems to be missing from a lot of games these days.", "summary": "One of the Best Games of the Year", "unixReviewTime": 1227225600}

I saw the ads for it on TV and decided to buy it  without renting first. I very rarely do that, but this time it was worth every penny of it and then some. The graphics are amazing in this game, the gameplay is great, and the story's pretty good too. It seems like the basic \"Save the princess\" game, but there are other characters and stuff, so it's really good. Playing the game is mad fun. I like this better than the Resident Evil games, because you don't have to worry about ammo. In RE, you have to duck around enemies without killing them to save ammo, but here you can kill anything that moves. You should, too, because you can collect their souls and use them to level up your items.  That is a great addition to the game, and I find it very satisfying to save up enough souls to pump up the weapons to the max and then hack through more demons to get more souls.  Although there's only 3 main weapons, they're varied enough to make them enough, and each has its own magic spell. The boss fights are each different and fun. On my memory card I have about 5 or 6 different save files, one before each boss, so I can fight each one whenever I want. My favorite boss is that Wasp-Lady, she takes awhile but it's fun.  The CG movies in this game are simply astonishing. The intro movie (and it does seem more like a movie than an intro) is great, and the scatterings of CGs throughout the rest of the game are mad good too.  I haven't finished the game yet, but I'm looking forward to the movie at the end, I know it's gonna be good. A little tip: at the main menu when you first turn it on, let it sit for a minute or so to see an ad for the game. It has CG clips and gameplay clips, and it's mad cool.  I recommend this game to anyone and everyone. Rent it if you want, but you should just buy it, you won't regret it.", "summary": "ONIMUSHA RULES!", "unixReviewTime": 992563200}

Warren", "reviewText": "For those of you who are gun shy after getting burned by the Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum, there is no reason to wait.  JMFU was garbage.  This is the real thing.  It does not use a balance board.  Some people seem to have a problem with that but it's not like they claimed to have balance board support and failed to deliver.  The description in Amazon of what it does is completely accurate.  Also, if it had balance board support it would be nearly twice the price.\n\nI received it yesterday and have done 2 workouts on it.\n\nThings I like (There is no way that I will hit all the good features):\n1. There was a very thorough fitness test when you first set up a profile.  I wish Wii Fit had something this comprehensive.\n2.  Maya, the coach, is a pleasure to work out with.  She has a pleasing voice.  She asks how you felt during a segment of the workout.  The choices are No Sweat, I Was Working Hard, and I Couldn't Keep Up.  If you choose the first or the third answer, Maya promises to adjust that segment the next time she presents it during a workout.\n3.  I like being able to change the environment that Maya leads the workout from and I like that the view of Maya changes during the workout.\n4.  You can incorporate other equipment into the workout.  I happened to have an unused step, some weights and a stability ball stored in the basement.  Neither of the workouts I did so far used the stability ball.\n5.  I still use the advanced step program on the Wii Fit but it is the same every time and the step is so low.  With this I am able to use a real step and adjust it to the height I want to get the best workout.\n6.  The routines scroll across the bottom so I can see how much is left of the current routine and which routine is coming up next.\n7.  The tutorial feature was a necessity for me.  When Maya started a routine that wasn't clear to me I selected the tutorial.  Maya explained how to do it.  It repeats until I select Resume.  Then Maya restarts the routine.\n8.  A workout DVD repeats the same workout every time.  This game is dynamic.  I need that kind of variety.\n\nThings I didn't like:\n1.  I don't have a large space to work out in.  I needed to have the step in a place where there was sufficient space to do the step routines but I also needed enough space to perform the non-step aerobic routines.  I banged into a couch a few times.  I think I'll be able to work this out after a few workouts.\n2.  This is probably related to my lack of space but I think I would prefer that it stick to the equipment for a longer time.  It used the step, then it didn't, then it did again, and so on.  On the other hand, not doing that may interfere with the randomness of the workouts and that would be a bad thing.\n\nI had 2 good workouts and definitely recommend this game as long as you have read the description and understand what you are getting.", "summary": "No reason to wait", "unixReviewTime": 1228435200}

All of them are awesome.\n\nThe story, for the reason to not blow the fun, I will not talk about the story. Everyone knows even pokemon game never actually have a big story, the b/w1 still made a lovely story which it much better that the old four generations. characters like N gave me a huge impact... B/W2 have the same stage, so you will enjoy the story just like b/w1. If you are huge pokemon fan and you want to know more pokemon story wise, there is a manga called \"Pokemon special\" that I huge recommend.\n\nsome weakness about b/w2:\n1: Nintendo decided to make this game still, on the ds. So the graphic dis not improve. Personally, I'm super excited for a new pokemon game on 3DS. Hopefully release next year 2013.\n\n2: They still didn't bring back the following pokemon like heart gold and soul silver did. I do not understand why.\n\n3: The character we used in b/w 1.

You use your swords to fight but also your short sword can be charged and then thrown at your opponents to absorb their abilities.  You may find that the weakest of creatures could have the most usuful of abilities, and vice versa.\n\nThis game is deceptivly deep and challenging.  The Bosses are for the most part Hard, yet incredible to fight.  Also just to tease RPG fanatics there is a Toy Collecting Mini game of sorts.  You can remove the toys from the packaging but then their value goes down if you choose to resell the toys (take that Fanatics).

While an effect only felt upon intense reflection, it is still pervasive.  This effect doesn't detract from the gaming experience, 7 and 8 are worthy games in their own right, but it seems to detatch these games from the series' roots.  Final Fantasy 9 firmly grasps these roots, and tenaciously clings to their nostalgic promises.  Perfectly pervasive and overwhelming in its effect, nostalgia floods from the screen while playing Final Fantasy 9--promising, reminding, revealing long surpressed emotions of the beleaguered old-time gamer.  This I felt upon my first time through, and I can't shake the feeling that this kind of game will disappear for lack of support and shivering nostalgia.\nPerhaps I am paranoid, but that feeling remains.  Please, gamers, don't let this kind of game disappear.  You may not have played the old RPG's, but they became much loved for a reason.  This reason, great design and simplistic charm, is one that must not be supressed by myriad graphical enhancements and gameplay so \"innovative\" that it eliminates the necessary and unadultured fun that makes RPG's so very appealing.\nOkay, rant over.  Final Fantasy 9 reveals the life of Zidane, an enigmatic and zany character--benevolent womanizer.  He becomes, through an expertly penned story, the main character in a fight to end the reign of a malign queen--the story eventually elevating to galactic proportions.  With an involving storyline, slick graphics the best of their time, and a simple management system that truly \"works,\" Final Fantasy 9 offers one heck of a gameplay experience.

New friends, new enemies, new things to do.  While it's not vastly different in many ways from the first one, that's what makes it so good.  Is it as great as the first one?  No, of course not, not that there weren't some odd things in the first one, but you can only do something new once.\n\nBioshock 2 also has what might be considered better trophies and achievements than the first one, but certainly ones that are better than a large number of other games.  There aren't such things as a silly requirement to find every one of an item, play though at crazy difficulty without dying, or manage to do things that are just about impossible for most people to do at all, or at least without getting very bored at grinding.  For example, take Homefront.  The task of finding every single newspaper clipping is an annoying one, and the multiplayer isn't good enough for most anyone to want to get everything including weapon camouflage to Expert level.\n\nSo speaking of multiplayer, Bioshock 2 has MP, compared to the first one which didn't.  While I was not expecting anything from it, I found it entertaining and somewhat addictive.  It's not crazily difficult to level in, there are a variety of game modes, and people are still playing it.  A great many games with multiplayer achievements and trophies (especially rhythm games) simply have nobody playing them or even have no servers running for them any longer.  While Bioshock 2 doesn't have dedicated servers, if it did they'd likely still be running because it's a franchise.  (For example, Battlefield Bad Company 2 has been out for over a year, but the servers for the first game are still running.)  The point being that if a multiplayer game has nobody playing for whatever the reason, it's impossible to get multiplayer trophies or achievements, and certainly it's impossible to enjoy playing against others.\n\nAlthough the multiplayer often seems to have people who can play impossibly well for humans operating on their own, which is likely partially due at least to the distributed non-dedicated server aspect of it, aside from people just really really good at aiming and headshots.  Yet there are enough matches where there are normal people playing, or where the aimbots and macros and such have taken a holiday.  Regardless, there's enough fun in the MP to extend the game (to get ready for that play through of the single player on hard) and it's even fun enough to come in lower on the match results.

Fox", "reviewText": "Other reviews have gone into what a great game THPS3 is, I think it is too, so I'll let them tell you how great it is, I'm going to compare the two major versions available (PC & PSX versions excluded)\nI bought THPS3 for GameCube as a test: The next time a game comes out for both PS2 and GameCube, which one do I buy?  The answer: It depends.\nThe most noticable difference between the PS2 and the GameCue version of this game is that there is no online play for the GameCube version, but it isn't like that matters since neither system has released their online adaptors yet.  So until Sony and Nintendo have their network adaptors (who cares about dial-up) on store shelves (or in my case, in Amazon warehouses) it is a moot point.\nGameCube advantages: Faster Framerate (for smoother motions) slightly better graphics (nothing to really scream about though), and it also wins out in the same battle N64 won over PSX... better 3-D environment.  In other words you don't end up seeing through sections of walls, or having it appear that the camera is now located inside of your character revealing the empty reverse of his hollow body.  Sure, this does not occur nearly as much as it did in PSX games, but it still happens.\nPS2 advantages: well, there is only one that I have found.  Lip balances!  On occasion with the GameCube version, when you try to grind on a surface you may instead end up doing some anti-gravitational lip balance.  Now this wouldn't bother me so much if it weren't for the fact that when it happens, the camera angle tends to shake (jitter) uncontrolably.  This may just be a bug in the game, hopefully it is not a GameCube thing that is going to occur in other games.\nMe, I'm keeping my GameCube version and selling the PS2 version to a friend, but that does not mean that I am going to buy a GameCube version over a PS2 version.  If a PS2 version comes out with better options, I'm getting the PS2 version.", "summary": "PS2 vs. GameCube the ultimate test.", "unixReviewTime": 1007424000}

It's nuts. But if you ever been to a tech show or demo, you'll notice that they all do. It's just the nature of the beast at this time. But as a consumer based product on the lower end of the pricing scale, it deliveries incredibly well.\n\nThe build quality and fit have always been one of my favorite aspects of Sony's headset since trying it on a few years ago at E3. It's unfortunate there isn't much there for the periphery but it really doesn't affect you all that much when you can turn all around to see the world you're currently in.\n\nThe audio jack on the set unfortunately is a bit low and really my only caveat for the headset.\n\nResolution wise which I hear many people complaining about, is really only evident on the menus and main screens. Once in a game, you lose all thought of that and feel very immersed in whatever game you're playing whether it's a gritty realistic game, or a more abstract one, you feel like you're there and forget you're wearing a headset. Theatre mode is also a fun way to spend time for those of us who can't afford to own a large television set.\n\nThere's a good amount of tech demoey games out at launch that range from average to really good.

First, you can play tour of duty campaigns in which you play as various civilizations (The Celts and Franks to name a few) against different kind of enemies. These missions are generally the most difficult part of the game, and most have you at them for hours before you finally come out the victor. The other two sections of the game are multiplayer (which you can play over a network or on the internet) and custom campaigns which let you play against the computer in a multiplayer style gaming environment. In this type of game, you get to pick any one of the 14 different civilizations to be, all of which have unique strengths and weaknesses. It's quite fun to go through each civilization researching new weapons and upgrades to see which fits you the best.\nEven though \"Age of Empires II\" is beginning to be dated, the game is still excellent and worth the money.

The characters are well-written and acting for the most part, although sometimes the main character, James, was hard for me to take seriously.  The monsters are also disturbing and well-designed.  The town is rendered beautifully, despite a thick fog obscuring your vision for more than a few meters.  Indoor environments are also very nicely done.\n\nAs for gameplay, the constant map checking can get fairly irritating.  Controls are standard for survival horror, but will probably take getting used to if you're new to the genre since they are very clunky.  In fact, this is the one place where the game (and survival horror in general) fall flat, but let's be honest, if you're playing Silent Hill you're either playing it for the scares or the storyline.\n\nTotal play time on your first play without a FAQ or guide will probably run you 8-10 hours.

Since Amazon really doesn't have any information about TH4 up yet, I thought I would offer some info courtesy of Gamespot.com:\nThe game features a totally redesigned career mode, one that takes away the standard two-minute time limit and instead applies time limits as you discover and start goals. Level goals are hidden in the new game, and some goals appear on the level only after certain previous goals have been completed. Also, the game will have multiple tiers of goals. Completing all of a level's amateur goals will unlock a pro challenge. Each skater will have a different pro challenge that is suited to fit that skater's career. The pro challenge is designed to be much more difficult than the standard goals. One of them will have a skater moving around to different parts of the level, doing a specific trick on a piece of scenery, all within a certain time limit. Once this challenge has been completed, a new set of pro goals will open up on the level.\nThe twist in Tony Hawk 4 is that you won't have to complete every goal with every single skater. Outside of the pro challenge, completed goals are counted so you could conceivably go through the game once with one skater, then go back and complete the pro challenges with every other skater to complete everything the game has to offer.\nThe San Francisco level featured the same type of goal structure as the rest of the game, though it didn't seem to be as beginner-focused as the first set of goals in the college level seemed to be. In San Francisco, you'll have to skate around and find five packages, save a man from four hungry seals, manual all the way down a pier, and of course, accomplish the standard score and spelling goals. Portions of the level's look and design are inspired by Fisherman's Wharf.", "summary": "Here is what we do know...", "unixReviewTime": 1032393600}

I imagine these are just 10 year old PS2-ers who view the XBox as the enemy, or something like that. I got this system a little while ago, and I am going to try to quell some of the arguments i've seen and heard concerning this console.\n\nThe complaint I've heard most often regards overheating. I've never had my unit overheat, and it's easy to keep it from doing so. Notice how when you stand the unit up the opening for the fan now faces bottom? That makes the unit not cool as efficiently. Just keep it on its side. Now, why Microsoft decided to make the fact that it can stand a perk of the system I don't know, since that makes it not cool as well. But by doing this, I have never had overheating problems. I imagine some of the people complaining about overheating are kids who try to leave their games going overnight or something.\n\nAnother complaint is the games. Either the games aren't \"next-gen\" enough, or the games just suck. For the games sucking, well there's not much choice out there now, and truthfully, I don't like many of the games out there. There's some pretty good ones, but no \"Halo\"s. But the games will get much better, and soon too. But alas, there are no real kids games available. This is because Microsoft wanted the 360 as more of an adult entertainment center, with online hookup, dvd capabilities, and more adult games. Regarding complaints about the graphics quality and the fact that the games aren't \"next-gen\" enough: early games never take full advantage of a system's capabilities. This was seen with the last xbox and even with other consoles. Halo 2 was defintiely above and beyond the original in terms of graphics. And of course if you have cruddy cables and a 10 year old 20\" tv, that won't really let the 360's graphics shine. I have high expectations, and I think the first game to shatter both arguements will be Oblivion (look at the trailers and you'll be wowed).\n\nI admit, the prices now are a bit ridiculous. However, I was able to casually walk into a store and find out that they just recieved a few units, and still had 2 new XBox 360s in stock, and they were selling them at normal price.

Today we land in the middle of that trilogy to look at the game based on the second film. Movie cash-in games are often a pain to play as there is often little effort going into the gameplay particularly, but can Spider-man 2 stand out from the majority and actually be good?\n\nThe game's story loosely follows the movie on which it is based, which involves Spider-man trying to stop Doc Ock, a scientist whose experiment gets the best of him. But the game doesn't entirely stick to the movie's plot: it takes many sidebars and throws in a bunch of other villains to add to the story and make it pretty big. The game progresses in chapters, each of which has a pretty straightforward to-do list, which is nice for getting through the game.\n\nBut moving on with the story won't occupy nearly all your time with the game. As you move about the city, people will constantly be screaming for help, and when you first start playing you find it hard to turn anyone down, but later you get tired of it and just move on when you don't need the hero points to progress in the story. This isn't helped by the fact that the same five or so tasks are reused way too much; you'll find yourself chasing down stolen cars and saving guys about to fall from rooftops way too often. The little variation in the tasks is disappointing, but thankfully you get most necessary hero points by doing cool special events so you're not stuck helping people for long increments of time.\n\nUnfortunately, though, the repetition doesn't stop with the overused tasks. Once you arrive at your destination and find a bunch of bad guys, there's little to do with them except mash the B button until they're all gone or get them all caught in your webs, turning them into punching bags when you will simply keep mashing the B button again. There are combos to be bought but they're extremely difficult to execute because later on you don't have a couple seconds to just stand there pushing a three-button combination because the masses of thugs will beat you up before you get that far. The fighting is more fun to watch than to play, I mean who wouldn't enjoy watching Spidey beat up a bunch of bad guys with great sound effects?\n\nWith all this repetition one would assume this is quite a boring game, but thankfully it somehow manages to be quite fun despite that. The best thing about the game is probably swinging around the city. When you're in the air, press R to make Spider-man shoot a web at the nearest building and you're off. There are a few techniques to master with this too, such as perfecting the jumps and making use of the slingshot move. This part of the game is nothing short of thrilling and extremely fun, and this is one of the main reasons it's so worthwhile.\n\nAnd even though the game's tasks are repetitive, the bright side is that you never run out of things to do. Helping civilians screaming at you isn't the only thing you can do anyways: there are several challenges around the city and about 200 help markers to find, plus a ton of extremely rare secrets to pick up. And since the city is so huge, this makes for a lot of good playtime.\n\nThe game's visual style isn't bad, but there are a few flaws in it. During gameplay the graphics look nice and simple, especially on the buildings that don't have much detail on them. This may be for the better, though, because when the animators tried to add a bit of detail to peoples' faces up close, they sometimes look pretty poor. Thankfully you don't look at those for long, and the rest of the visual package is pretty nicely done.\n\nAs a movie based game, Spider-man 2 wouldn't quite be complete without some authentic voice acting, which it does have. Peter Parker/Spider-man, M.J., and Doc Ock are all played by the same actors/actress as in the movie. Spider-man has several witty lines up his sleeve, but like the missions, it won't be long before you've heard them all and start wondering why he's saying the same things every once in a while. The rest of the sound is also great, with the cool punching effects and web slinging sounds and some pretty epic music too.\n\nOverall, Spider-man 2 is pretty much the ultimate last-gen fan service to people who love the superhero. Swinging around the city is nothing short of thrilling and while beating up thugs and criminals is pretty repetitive, it never loses its entertainment in simply watching. There are a lot of villains in the game too, such as Mysterio, which is pretty neat. So yes, Spider-man 2 does manage to stand out in the world of movie cash-ins, and clearly some actual effort went into this nicely done game.\n\nGameplay: 8.5\nGraphics: 7.5\nSound: 8.5\nValue: 8.5\n\nFINAL SCORE: 8.2/10", "summary": "The huge world and amount of things to do is great, it's just pretty repetitive", "unixReviewTime": 1229385600}

In fact, a recent infoleak on attests that it was in fact M$ that rushed MCC out the door, hence it's glitchy state.\n\nThe singleplayer aspects were all remarkable as per usual, but the multiplayer? I'd have more fun pulling my own teeth out than wait hours on end just to find a game. When the MP did work, it was a blast from the past for the most part, but even that wasn't without problems, what with the framerate drops and deplorable lag you'd get from time to time, you'd be lucky if you weren't outright dropped from the f***ing game. Even worse, I was FURIOUS to know that something like this did not get dedicated servers. The first few weeks of this were DREADFUL, and even worse, it was the ONLY reason I got my Xbox, and my frustration boiled to where I was a hair's length away from selling my Xbox One back to GameStop and get my money back and maybe get a Playstation 4 instead.\n\nA month or so later, when the patches arrived, this made the multiplayer a LOT less frustrating, and I may be sitting for a few minutes or less before I get paired up with players. Otherwise, it takes me right back to the good old days.\n\nThe Multiplayer is what everyone got it for, I am certain, so I'll talk about it. Halo 2 and Halo 2 Anniversary have their own individual games and matches, so Halo 2 classic wasn't replaced. Unfortunately, Halo 2 Anniversary only got six or seven remade maps, which is lame. I was happy to know that Halo 1 got it's own multiplayer too, however it never got the anniversary treatment like it's campaign did, but you are quick to overlook that when the nostalgia settles in. Halo1 and Halo 2 Classic both got exclusives from the PC versions, namely levels, weapons and vehicles. Halo 3 and Halo 4 have their own multiplayer as well, and it's the same as before in their own separate, standalone titles. However, customization is limited to just armor sets rather than individually customizing each part, like, you want the CQB armor? You get the chest, shoulder and helmet in one set, ect.\n\nHalo 2 Anniversary is the big selling point for the game, so I'll go off and say that Halo 2 Anniversary was well done, Certain Affinity and 343 put their hearts into re-envisioning everything in the game, it looks and sounds beautiful. Even better, that you can instantaneously switch between the old graphics, music and sound with the new ones, even though some of the music tracks are... Unpleasantly different, like \"Follow\" and \"Blow me away\" aren't in the anniversary mode, like they couldn't get the rights for it, but still have the originals in the classic mode? This confuses me.\n\nEven better; unlike the original game, (which was meant to have it, but got left out at the last minute, sadly) campaign has online coop, you and another buddy can tackle the covenant together, or mess around and search the levels for glitches and other fun easter eggs leftover from the old days (namely, the Scarab gun on Metropolis).\n\nAt face value, it's a three out of five, it would have maybe been a four or four and a half out of five had the glitches and server problems been hammered out before the release. Sure, the patches fixed a lot of the problems, but M$ fails to realize that first impressions count, and it can be costly, I mean for God's sake, I was so close to trading my Xbox in for a PS4 the online issues annoyed me so bad.\n\nBottom line; good game, now that the patches are here, but if you plan on getting it, I'd say wait until after the holidays, you can already tell that a game like this will go down in price within a few months.", "summary": "Not a day-one game", "unixReviewTime": 1418947200}

I poured more hours into Double Dash on Gamecube that I care to admit, and I was skeptical that the tilt controls would be adequate. I ended up borrowing the game from a friend for a few weeks.\n\nI have a blast playing this with friends. Most of my friends aren't gamers, but they all understand the concept of a wheel. I can navigate all the menus, and they can just play it. It nails that sweet spot that Wii Sports has where people just 'get it', except the entertainment lasts much longer.\n\nAdmittedly, what works well for a multi-player campaign can be annoying in the single player game. Luck does play a much larger role than you want it to when you are actually trying to improve yourself. It's great for the get-togethers because you're much less likely to become \"that guy\" that always wins and no one wants to play (like I was on Double Dash), but it is a hassle when you want to unlock content.\n\nI must say that I was sorely disappointed in the changes that were made to the battle games. It's one of those things that you wouldn't miss unless you've played older versions of the game, but a straight port of the Gamecube games would have been much better.\n\nAfter I had to give the game back to my friend, I realized that I had a significant hole left in my libaray and I am now buying it. This game is worth owning for the same reasons that set the Wii apart from other consoles.

The plot is back there behind the curtains, of course, but those who haven't read the books or seen the films won't be able to make heads or tails of it. Being a Tolkien zealot, so to speak, and an avid supporter of the first film as well, I found \"The Two Towers\" to be a mixed bag. It sometimes borders on greatness, but then falls short. Why? Well, let me begin with what the game does well.\n First of all, the gameplay is fast, intense, and relentless, and it generally mimics key moments from the films. Yes, there are a handful of moments from \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" as well as the upcoming \"Two Towers.\"\n The production values go above and beyond. Several of the film's key players are on hand to vocalize their gaming counterparts, which goes a long way toward injecting you with that \"Wow, I'm in the movie!\" sensation. On top of this, Howard Shore's rousing soundtrack throbs during the action, giving you that much incentive to \"hunt some orc.\" The sound effects and the graphics are splendid as well, and further give you the sensation of being there.\n The game's transitions between film footage (some good \"Two Towers\" preview moments here!) and in-game graphics are worthy of honorable mention.\n \"The Two Towers\" allows you to play as Aragorn, Gimli, or Legolas, and each of them have their own particular abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. They can also acquire experience points which can be used to purchase new orc-dispatching attacks. The addition of these three playable characters is vastly important, because it gives a short, linear game some replay value it might have lacked.\n For fans of the films, there are interviews, documentaries, and other goodies that can be unlocked during the course of the game.\n \"The Two Towers\" is challenging, but rarely frustrating (with the possible exception of the Plains of Rohan stage, which played havoc with my temper).\n The game's most fascinating missions involve epic battles, like those that take place at the fortress of Helm's Deep. These moments are extremely memorable, and you'll want to play them again and again.\nAlas! All is not perfect in this valiant effort. Here are some of the game's failings.\n The gameplay isn't story-driven, and for the uninitiated, it won't make much sense (but, then, why are you even playing this game if you're not a fan already?).\n Missions leap from one story sequence to another without warning. For instance, you go from playing as Aragorn defending Frodo on Weathertop immediately to the mines of Moria, and there aren't any cut-sequences that actually smooth the transition. The clips that do pop up between levels are essentially promotional campaigns for the upcoming film, and not story-driving elements. It's jarring.\n The game tries for camera angles reminiscent of those seen in the films, but which are usually functional as well. However, in every game that has a fixed camera, problems do occur, and they can be very annoying. Fortunately, it's the exception rather than the rule.\n The action is very arcade-like, and feels like a cutting edge Double Dragon clone. The play mechanics are essentially the same. You slug it out with opponents while traveling a very linear path from which you cannot veer for any reason. Times have changed since Double Dragon, naturally, so this is the best variation of the formula I've ever seen, but it remains an aging gameplay mechanic. It's not for everybody.\n Timed missions involve too much trial and error (especially the aforementioned Plains of Rohan level, which is particularly frustrating).\n You can't skip all of the video sequences, even if you've seen them a hundred times.\n The game isn't as true to the source material as it should be - and when I refer to the source material, I mean the books, as it's early November and the next film won't hit theaters until mid-December. Fortunately, most of these deviations are acceptable in the spirit of the gameplay, provided you're not a less open-minded Tolkien fan than I am. I just hope the movie doesn't take so many liberties with this beloved tale. I tend to trust Mr. Jackson after such a successful adaptation of book 1, however, and I digress...\n The single most disappointing thing about this game is its length. This game is excruciatingly short, and experienced and dedicated players should have it conquered within a few hours. It may have incentive to replay it from the beginning, but that's still not as cool as a longer campaign would have been.\n No chance to duke it out with the Balrog. Argh!\nSo, in the end, I recommend this game to fans of non-stop action gaming, but it is important that you also know at least a little about the storyline that is moving things along behind the scenes. On top of this, you must be willing to deal with the game's shortcomings (and I do mean SHORTcomings, because the game is over so bloody quickly!). As far as Tolkien zealots go, be warned that the game strays from the storyline at times in favor of visceral gaming. However, if I can handle that, I'm sure you can as well. When it's all said and done, this is a fine product worthy of your time.\nFinal Grade: B- (or 4 stars, to grade on a curve)", "summary": "A Tolkien/gaming fanatic's review of The Two Towers...", "unixReviewTime": 1036195200}

Instead, they just take the 2D over-world and tilt the camera angle a bit to make it appear less flat. They've added some new pointless and unexciting mechanics like riding Pokemon and Horde Battles (battling 5 Pokemon at once). Nothing revolutionary, of course. Some of it is even just flat out unenjoyable like Super Training, a way to boost your Pokemon's stats by hitting a button over and over again.\n\nSince Black and White actually introduced characters and a plot ever so slightly different from the mainstay, I was hoping this game would actually give us some kind of story.

In case we don't grab the Atlas Shrugged references fast enough, they even named the world's creator Ryan, halfway between Ayn (rhymes with pine) and Rand. We get it, we get it! But who can complain about a game fashioned after the vision of one of the 20th century's most individualistic philosophers? This is after all a first person shooter.\n\nI liked the perfectly rendered world, the fine posters/clues on the walls, the weird enemies, the nice touch of the hacking puzzles, and in general most everything in this game. Especially the lack of gory blood and guts; I play these things to look at someone's dream world, not someone's entrails.

Here's the site: [...]\nYou'll have to download Origin (only 16mb) which is a EA service and then from your game library you can download it for free!\n\nThe game itself is nice. It is the first Battlefield game to have been released back in 2002. Graphics aren't super, they're alright.\n\nIt is set during WWII.\n\nYou can play as the Germans, Americans, Japanese, British, and Russian.\n\nWhat I really like about this game is the \"Instant Battles\" mode, which let's you play skirmish battles all you want. They are options like enemy AI difficulty, ticket penalty, and a few more. Each map has it's own set factions which fight each other. Like on the Kursk map you will have the Germans vs the Russians and on the Iwo Jima map you'll have the Japanese vs the Americans. These nations are preselected and you can't choose what you want sadly.\n\nThere are many weapons and vehicles you can use. You can use Karabiner 98k rifles, STG 44s, stationary MG42s (only stationary you can't carry them D:), Browning Automatic Rifles, and many more. All of the vehicles you see on the battlefield are drivable, these include, Panzer IVs, Tigers, Shermans, T-34s, etc. There are self-propelled artillery guns like the Priest, Katyusha and Wespe. A few jeeps like the Willy and Kbelwagen. There are planes as well like the Messerschmitt Bf 109, Stuka Ju87, P-51 Mustangs, Spitfires, Zeros, Ju-88As, Il-2 Sturmoviks, and many more. You can also use stationary, Flak 20mm guns and Bofor 40mm guns.\nThe game has Battleship but you can't drive them, you can use their main 18 inch naval guns though! You can also use coastal guns.\n\nThere are 2 expansion packs for this game. One is Battlefield 1942: The Road To Rome and the other is Battlefield 1942: Secret Weapons of WWII. I have not played any of these two so I can't say how they are, but from some description reading The Road To Rome pack is based on the Italian Campaign. And the Secret Weapons of WWII adds many new weapons, vehicles, maps, as well as a new game mode. Road to Rome adds more weapons and vehicles.\n\nThese is a multiplayer mode as well but whenever I search for matches I don't get very many and the one I do get only have a few players playing on them.\n\nThere is a singleplayer, but I believe you can only play as the Allies... not sure because I've been playing the skirmishes most of the time.\n\nIt's an old game but it's fun.

It perfected the genre of Survival Horror and created a cult following immediately. Even today it is one of the most successful franchises in game history and definitely a large part of the bread and butter at CAPCOM. However it did not achieve this status for nothing. With every CLASSIC game there is a special and carefully developed gameplay system. The Resident Evil series from the beginning was developed with exploration and puzzle solving in mind. Then the graphical presentation was developed to supply enough detail and interest that a person would actually want to explore it. The setting, in a mansion full of horror story influences, was perfect for the type of game style that was being developed. At the time they used static backgrounds due to the fact that the Sony Playstation system couldn't display enough polygons to make a believable environment. But doing it this way also proved to make the graphical presentation much smoother and more detail rich. Later the series would try full 3D in Code Veronica for Sega Dreamcast, and then return to it's roots on GameCube in perhaps the best looking game to date. Resident Evil Gaiden for GBC was perhaps an unrealistic attempt from the beginning. The gameplay has completely changed so dramatically that it becomes a new game with a Resident Evil logo. It resembles more of a Metal Gear 8-bit Nintendo game from the 80's than a Resident Evil game. The battle system is completely boring and overly hard. It is more like a game of golf because you have to hit the button at the right time on a progress bar that scrolls left to right before you can shoot a zombie in combat mode. It's tricky and timing is everything. But, more importantly it just doesn't fit the RE universe and it is a poor attempt to port a name over to a dead handheld system with way too little power for such a detail/exploration latent game as RE. The graphics are horrible even for GBC standards and the battle system is poorly developed and there is no since this is even a RE game at all. Invest in something else, anything else. For 20 bucks more you could have RE for GameCube, the best RE there is. Stay away from this game I promise you will be taking it back the next day to trade for something else.

After growing up playing such wonderful games as Grim Fandango, the Monkey Island series, and the Longest Journey, it absolutely pains me to see where the genre is going.  I had relatively high hopes for this game (seeing as it's marketed towards fans of Syberia) but after even the first five minutes, I could tell I was in for a boring experience.\n\nYou are a girl searching for your friend Celeste at the Dragonvale Academy.  Think Hogwarts without any of the charm or creativity.  You arrive to discover the place deserted, and come across a \"keepsake\" of Celeste's.  This sparks a journey of discovery in serach of your lost friend.\n\nThe premise for the game is okay, but the delivery is just plain terrible.  The voice acting is sub-par (especially when giants like Dreamfall: the Longest Journey are setting the standard), and verges on awful at times.  The character animations are clunky and they move at a speed that would make my grandmother say \"Hurry up, would you?  You're holding us up.\"  The pacing of the game is also too slow for its own good.  Perhaps you're on a journey of discovery, but there's certainly no rush to find Celeste.\n\nThe only reason I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 is because of the okay graphics.  They don't blow you away and they pale in comparison to recent titles like The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, but they are by far the best part of the game.\n\nMy suggestion is take your thirty bucks elsewhere and buy a game worthy of your support.  Like the Longest Journey or Dreamfall, or Syberia.  I love adventure games, but this is a new low, even for the Adventure Company.\n\nPros:\n\nThe graphics are okay\n\nCons:\n\nPretty much everything else\n\nThe voices are terrible\n\nThe animations are clunky\n\nThe Puzzles are boring\n\nThe story is boring\n\nNothing new here", "summary": "Another bland adventure game from the Adventure Company", "unixReviewTime": 1146009600}

Its one of those that, I tell myself \"Just one more mission\" and three missions later I realize I forgot my task, then I say and \"Just after this mission, I'll do that thing\".  Its a rarity I find a game that can get me so enamored with it.  I played the original PS-One version and the XCOM: Enemy Unknown that came out a few years back.  This is a polished, turn based strategy game that you never know how things are going to work out or what new enemies you will find along the way.  I'm on my second play though and like every other XCOM I've played, I've always did super bad on the first go around, but then succeed well on the second.  There are many more enemies to contend with, a welcome change of pace and it really keeps you on your toes.\n\nSo why only 4 stars?  There are a few caveats, one is with the game's tutorial.  It seems like that when I find a new enemy, I have to figure out what its strengths and weaknesses are, even though my 2nd in command or my chief scientist tells me \"Oh yeah we seen those before\".  You would think that there would be a Dossier on the enemy that I can review as soon as I meet it, so I'm not spending time and resources experimenting with the new target.  Only when my subordinates say \"OH CRAP THATS NEW\" should I be concerned with discovery.\n\nOddly enough since this is a continuation with the XCOM: Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within that somehow we have lost technical knowledge on decent weapons and armor?  I would say let the 'best' of the first XCOM be the 'base' of XCOM 2 and grow from there.\n\nOne last thing is a few game mechanics.  Sometimes the dice roll is just plain wrong.  I've had several times where I'm point blank with a minigun only to do no damage to target.  I'm sorry, that target should be kibbles and bits.  I find myself having to back up to set out a flurry with the minigun.  The Viper is also broken.  It has a tongue that can go through an entire building and snatch wary soldiers.  I've seen this tongue go 8 to 10 tiles (at 3x3 that means 24 to 30 foot).  There is nothing in XCOMs reality that can accomplish this with any precision and break through windows and pull a soldier through.  Especially given the fact the snake is maybe 10 feet long stretched out.  I'm sorry, that attack should only be 3 to 4 tiles MAX and only open line of sight.  Not through two windows on opposite sides of a building.  They are bad enough spitting poison on everyone.  The funny part is, they are usually pulling the soldier into unknown areas and this will trigger events.  So while the soldier is getting crushed, he or she is calmly reporting \"Hey I see some bad guys over here\" and \"I got eyes on our target\".", "summary": "Great game, if you like XCOM get this NOW", "unixReviewTime": 1496102400}

I've got about 5 hours of game play in on BF1.  Having said that, I am somewhat disappointed in this game so far. Graphics are great, sound is great, character movement is pretty good, ground vehicle movement isn't that great,  and multiplayer seems to work good. There is something missing, though, that makes this unlike the past several BF releases. It seems like I've really gotta lay into someone to get them to go down, good luck trying to ambush a small group of soldiers; and on top of that character movement seems to be a bit slower. While the maps look beautiful, they don't seem as dynamic as past BF games, not a lot of places to hide, not a lot of differentiation.\nWe'll see though, I'll give it some more play time and  see what the first patch or two addresses and edit my review if I think its getting better.\n\nOverall, it still is a good game and fun to enjoy just on the audio visuals alone; way better than BlackOps3, but that's not hard to beat.\n\nEDIT:\n11/1/16 I had played BF3 & BF4 on the XB360 and playing this on the XB1 is a step in the direction of BIG. I must say I actually prefer the smaller maps with less players. Why can't there be an option for the same map / game mode but with smaller boundaries, less players, and reduced checkpoints / flags? Should be pretty simple, right?\n\n11/6/16 Multiplayer is consistently BUGGY. Can't throw grenades half the time, can't shoot my primary weapon, not able to run / get stuck in slow motion, and I can be aiming right at somebody standing still from close range and I can't hit them.\nMenu system and end of game stats are unbearably slow to move through.\nLeaving the game is a matter of timing. You've got about 10 seconds to leave the game after the previous game has finished or your forced to wait for the next game to load and then quit out of that.\n\nUpdate 5/11/17\nOk, after having multiple updates come out addressing some of the major issues and bugs that the game shipped with I can say this is now a top notch game that exceeds my expectations.

For example, the coolest looking character Raven is such a shallow character that developers think refuse to talk or listen equals cool.

What is worse, the story is incomplete, actually I don't even care anymore. What I can say about the story of this game is obvious below average even if you use the anime standard. I guess the guy who drew the comic part wrote this holy mother of god awful script.

Its almost a brown pants required game even without VR, but this alone may justify the expense, if you can tolerate it.\n\nPROS:\nAwesome intro and setup\nIntriguing characters\nNovel RE combat approach\n\nCONS:\nFaces and voices slide out of sync to the point they're cartoonish\nCertain story points aren't really explained at all (I have that thingy back... well doesn't that beat all))\nProgression system and coins are new and different but bizarre\nStealth approach doesn't work in an area the size of a shoe box\n\nThe story is classic horror movie. You're girlfriend sends you a video to stay away, so you rush to her rescue. And the setup and delivery of the story has all the tones and feel of RE, but none of the hacky, cheesy nonsense from the last several iterations.\n\nCombat is sublime and wonderful. The feeling is almost Call of Cthulu brutal, in that you have no info, no HUD, and no real indications apart from blood splatter on the screen and a ammo count.\n\nAudio and visuals are great and add to the tension. You can look out windows and it actually makes sense why certain doors and windows can't be opened, but otherwise everything has a reason, even if its somewhat weak, and more puzzles are collection and exploration and fewer find the diamond horse statue.\n\nOverall, a magnificent departure that could only be made better if it severed the boat anchor of the past games.

CJ must travel all over the state to bring down drug dealers,corrupt cops and gang bangers.

{"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "05 3, 2017", "reviewerID": "A1WODHQ4IPYSAE", "asin": "B000056H2D", "reviewerName": "Skittler", "reviewText": "Developed by / Rainbow Studios\nPublished by / Sony\nRelease date / Feb 5, 2001\n\nIntroduction - If you have any experience with Rainbow Studios you know they're legendary when it comes to MX/ATV games. Their track record speaks for itself. They developed Motocross Madness 1/2, ATV Off-road 1/2, MX Unleashed, and MX Vs. ATV Unleashed and still continue to develop games even after being bought from THQ by Nordic Games. This was their first Off-road game for consoles and probably the best MX or ATV game up until that time period.\n\nGraphics - At first I wasn't amazed by the graphics but the more I played the further I appreciated the games style. It certainly is an upgrade from the PS1/N64 similar type games and for 2001 I'm rather impressed. The terrain seems to merge together nicely with the foliage and the mountains and various objects. Each track appears different in color, and the sunlight and textures really pop out on certain maps. Nothing is too sharp and there is plenty to see and explore. Some tracks are massive and they have skillfully placed jumps, houses, parked cars and bridges to have fun on. I love exploring the game and finding secrets, easter eggs, or glitches. Rainbow Studios really went above and beyond to make this game nearly flawless. The four-wheelers look decent but are tad bit fuzzy and the exterior frames of each vehicle seem to be all merged together without much detail. Same goes for the riders. I could barely recognize a muffler or any other small sections of the ATV if I chose a bright color like red because the components blend together way too much.\n\nControls - Very simple to pick up and play. X controls acceleration and left analog stick controls your steering. For bigger jumps you flick down on the left analog stick at the base of a jump and snap it forward when leaving the jump. The tricks are easy to pull of with the triangle and square buttons allowing you to use a variety of tricks. My only gripe is no back flip seems to be present in this version. You can also choose a variety of camera angles to your liking.\n\nMusic/Sound - A lot of Grunge, Post-Grunge, and Nu-Metal. Bands like Alice In Chains, Soundgarden, Anthrax, Sevendust, and Primus. If that's not your style you can turn the music down. I usually turn it down so I can hear the engines even though the engines pretty much all sound the same. You will hear your guy/girl grunt and make other noises when you crash or hit other vehicles. Also, the crowd cheers when you make a huge jump or pass other opponents even if there is no crowd present. It's almost like having your own real-life laugh track only cheering.\n\nGameplay - The reason you play the game. Obviously you must advance in career mode to unlock tracks, but the biggest disappointment is that there is only one ATV to unlock to my knowledge. It's the fastest and has the best stats so I suppose it make sense. Other modes are Nationals, Supercross, Enduro, and Freestyle. You can practice on pretty much any course and mode or you can do hot laps/time trials to beat the best times. There is no difficulty mode to choose from but I found the set difficulty a little challenging but not overly impossible. Career mode doesn't take very long so you can have all the courses and ATV's within a few hours. You can also create/edit your own waypoint race on any track but you can't race computer players on them. You and a friend could split screen it but don't expect to race if you're by yourself unless you do a time trial. You can edit it to make it very difficult or very easy and adds replaybility to the game.\n\nFinal Thought - Definitely a must have if you enjoy racing and off-road games. It doesn't have all the features of the later versions but it's nice to see where it all started. It's extremely enjoyable to ride around and freeroam and see what you can discover. With Two-Players I imagine it to be even more exciting. Unfortunately I don't have any gaming friends to test it out with but it looks like a blast from what I've seen on YouTube. The game is dirt cheap now and worthy of a play.", "summary": "Surpasses all previous ATV/MX games", "unixReviewTime": 1493769600}

Of note... if you want to clear all save data (using DSI XL) then hold L, Select, and right on the control pad while STARTING the game and it will load up and ask to clear all data.  The instructions were written for the old DS system).\n\nBeing new to this series, I have not had the opportunity to play the previous games and so the characters, story, and, well, everything is new.  The game makes a nice point of separating itself from previous games.  You really don't need all of the back story since most of the characters are treated as being new (they are new to your commanders at least), so you get to learn about them as you play.  Since this story is set in a distant land from the previous titles, you really don't need that connection of story lines.\n\nThe campaign mode starts slow and the missions are rather easy at first.  You don't really need to read the manual, but it is nice to scan through.  Some of the tutorials are rather vague about what some units do or what they are effective against.\n\nAround the 8th mission or so things begin to get more interesting.  Despite being my first time playing AW, I was grabbing S rank on many of the first missions. Later missions I was regularly struggling to finish off the more persistent enemy COs.  There are later missions where you have a finite number of units and once they're gone, they're gone.  Other maps you can build and create units.  Again this is in Campaign mode).\n\nI also enjoyed that many of the maps require different tactics to win.  Not every map has the 'kill all enemies' victory requirement.  Some maps will have you taking out specific units, or capturing the enemy base, or destroying a particular fortress.\n\nThe music changes based on what commanding officer is currently controlling the action.  Each ally and enemy has a unique score.  Some are more mellow, others more intense.  I like the variety though.  I could see many players choosing their favorite COs based on the music (I kind of did!).\n\nThe enemy AI is actually pretty smart most of the time.  This makes for a good challenge, without the AI being 'cheap'.  Instead it seems the AI will select effective units to use against your units.  They don't seem to send infantry to attack your tank units too often...\n\nThe real treat with this game is all of the amazing additional content.  There is the online wifi vs mode of course.  But there is a mode where you can battle the computer AI on a number of pre-made maps.  The best extra is the ability to create your own maps and then battle on those.  You get combat points to spend in the shop where you can buy extra maps and COs to use in these extra modes (as well as to change their clothes/hair color if you want).\n\nI have only been playing for about 8 to 10 hours so far (mission 18), but I plan to continue updating this review as I progress deeper into the game.  But so far I can see many happy hours spent playing.  And then I can't wait to open up my copy of AW4 Days of Ruin!", "summary": "A super fun and addictive battle simulator ~", "unixReviewTime": 1318982400}

Ege/Acedoh", "reviewText": "Niko is new to America.  Brought by hopes and promises of his cousin Roman about how wealthy he is.  Unfortunately for Niko he quickly finds the stories to be lies.  Grand Theft Auto IV starts as others in the series with an anti-hero.  Getting involved in doing the wrong things is all to easy in this game.  From the very get go you are learning that living the American life can be difficult and in order to get your story going you must break the law.  For the most part Niko doesn't have a problem with this since he has become raw after being a soldier in war.\n\nGTA IV has probably one of the darkest stories so far in the series.  This is not the type of game you will play and comment on how cheerful the story is.  For those of you who have played previous GTA games you will notice many similarities.  From the gameplay mechanics to the story line.  Although people who are new to the GTA series will find how simple the learning curve really is in this game.  The game gives you an incredible amount of tutorials and guides you thru your first several missions making things easy to understand.  Most features in this game are simple to understand and keep this game from getting over anyones learning curve.\n\nWhat has made the Grand Theft Auto series so superb is the story telling.  Excellent voice acting with intense and exciting missions make GTA IV a true winner.  From the first moment on you will notice that you aren't really playing a game as much as taking part in an intense crime drama.  Think Sopranos from the former Soviet Union.  The game is mission based and gives you the ability to choose what you want to do at any given point.  You meet numerous characters who are all about committing crimes and they give you certain jobs.  Of course these jobs increase your reputation and help progress you thru the story.  Along the way you will find numerous characters.  Some you will like and others you will probably want to get rid of yourself.\n\nThis game has further evolved ideas from previous GTA games.  Niko can not only date one woman at a time but several.  It's really up to you.  Just remember how in real life this can be time consuming it can also be in a game.  You will have woman calling and texting you if you ignore them to long.  Then comes taking them out for dates.  Each woman has different tastes and interests and it's up to you to know where to take them.  Some of the activities can actually be fun like playing darts or pool as these mini games do have learning curves.  The girl you are with will respond to your success or failure at these games.  Obviously there are numerous other activities in wonderful Liberty City.  Also it's important for Niko to accessorize and finding the best clothing to wear is important.  Image is everything as as you progress you get access to better clothes.  The car mechanics have improved in this game but don't expect to have similar handling to a racing game.  What is cool to look at is the amazing detail they have put into the car damage.  Every little ding makes an impact on the car you are in.  Lastly is the music selection.  An incredible 200 songs are available in Liberty City to listen to on the radio.  Numerous radio stations including the talk ones belt out hit songs and comedic advertisements.  Niko even has the ability to watch t.v.  They covered every detail in this game and it shows.\n\nAs if a single player mode that will take you 30 to 40 hours to beat is not enough there is also online multiplayer.  Yes you and 15 others can play on the beautiful streets of Liberty City.  The multiplayer is truly open ended for your enjoyment.  Several game modes plus the ability to create your own multiplayer.  You can also invite seven friends to take on eight others.  It's easy to say this game will be enjoyed for months on end.  Within six months the 360 will also have it's own unique content that will be available on XBOX LIVE.\n\nIt's easy to be impressed by Liberty City.  It's as close to New York City as any game has ever got.  From the pedestrians that make up the neighborhood to the realistic design of the buildings.  The weather changes and the days progress realistically.  This is one of those games where you can just take it in and enjoy the scenery.  In Grand Theft Auto you have the freedom to do what you want.  This game is intended for adults.  The language and content can be mature most of the time.  Although that is at a parents discretion.  I wouldn't suggest this game for everyone.  Although I would suggest it for those who have enjoyed previous Grand Theft Auto games.  I would also suggest it for those who enjoy mafia or crime movies.  This game will have you sitting back and enjoying the incredible story.  Just don't forget that it's your story to play.", "summary": "Welcome to Liberty City", "unixReviewTime": 1209772800}

The game is even better than any action movie that has come out to local movie theaters this year. The game is just slightly better than Halo 3 which up to this time was one of my favorite games to come out this year. Now my review is based on the single player portion of the game only.\n\nThere is no comparison between Call of Duty 4 and Medal of Honor: Airborne as far as which is a better game to play. Medal of Honor: Airborne has just six missions to play through and that's it. I am not making that up. Medal of Honor: Airborne takes place during World War II with American Airborne soldiers fighting the Axis throughout Europe during the war. The first four missions in Medal of Honor: Airborne are very realistic. The last two missions are like made up fantasy missions where you are fighting Super Nazi Soldiers that take forever to kill. Call of Duty 4 is a ten times better game to play than Medal of Honor: Airborne.\n\nI could tell from the very first minute that I started to play Call of Duty 4 just how great a game it was going to be. The graphics in the game are just simply amazing. They are by far the best graphics I have ever seen in any game except for Crysis. Crysis is the game to beat as far as graphics go.\n\nThe very first mission in the game takes place on a Russian freighter out in the middle of the ocean where you play the role of a British soldier fighting Russian terrorists aboard ship at night in stormy weather. Just to look at the water come up against the ship is amazing. I just had to stop to look at the huge ocean waves hitting the sides of the ship. I couldn't believe how real the ocean waves look hitting the sides of the ship.\n\nIn another mission, I play the role of an American Marine fighting terrorists in the middle of a Middle Eastern city. My character, along with some fellow American Marine soldiers, are supporting an American tank going through the middle of this city. Well an enemy tank approachs us and the American tank you are supporting fires a round from the tank's main gun at the enemy tank. The enemy tank gets hit and explodes and the turret on the enemy tank flies off into the air. It was one best looking explosions I have ever seen in a game.\n\nIn another mission in Russia you are again playing the role of the British soldier. An enemy helicopter follows you around at night with a big searchlight trying to find you and some fellow British soldiers. Why you are trying to avoid being detected by the enemy helicopter, you get attacked by some enemy German Shepherd dogs that are the most realistic dogs I have ever seen in a game. The dogs look very real.\n\nCall of Duty 4 reminds me a lot of what is going on today with the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan today. The game makes me proud of our American soldiers who are serving over in Iraq and Afghanistan today. You learn to appreciate more our men and women in uniform and all the sacifices they are making today for our freedoms.

My gut feeling tells me that you're not going to be able to sell your old versions because everyone is going to want this one instead.  I knew it too because when I saw the previews, I stopped buying the expansion packs, immediately, just to wait this one out.\n\nHow is it?  Fantastic.  The graphics are fluid and smooth, the characters have fingers, wedding rings, facial expressions, man, you name it they've worked on it and it's obvious.  The clothing has fluidity (the hair too) and zooming in close up to a character's face really shows some detail.  Nice, nice job.  Playing the game *is* pretty similar to the first but you can tell Maxis did their homework and I can just see Will saying: \"Okay, THIS is what the fans want\" cause it sure looks like they worked on it.\n\nFor instance, its the little things that make a difference.  When a sim walks in the room, the other sims react, say hello... I had a dad come home from work and the child he was close to dropped her toy and ran out to greet him by jumping in his arms.  They are no longer stiff like the first Sims, they have reactions which are pretty cool.  Also, there's an amazing amount of detail.  The fridge has a variety of food (and can be emptied now, unfortunately, but you call the grocer) and the more a Sim knows how to cook, the different varieties of food they can make.  A Sim can cook either Salmon or Mac and Cheese and they look exactly like they seem.  That was pretty wild to pause and inspect.\n\nWhat else?  They age.  Yup, they sure do.  It's better than the first and more difficult as well.  My Sims tried for a baby -- and first of all ended up with twins!  Holy cow, that was work.  Now, the infants cry for different things and just feeding and holding them doesn't work anymore.  They're specific.  Changing the diaper... bathing them... all the little things you'd expect with a baby, except they're babies for only a few days, then toddlers for a few days, then they turn into kids and teens and so on.\n\nThink its easy?  Nope.  You gotta nurture the kid through your Sim.  Early nurturing calls for good development.  Teaching them to walk, talk and communicating makes a better child who is better in school eventually.  Unfortunately, I've got some lazy sims who don't want to help their kids with homework and the social worker keeps coming to take them away.  It goes pretty quick, too.  This isn't your old Sims games, either... they don't just sob a bit when this happens -- the parents endup traumatized.\n\nNeglect the Sims and there's consequences.  Let's say... the sim's social meter is really, really low.  They can actually snap and start babbling.  Next thing I know, a therapist drops in and starts helping the sim out.  Funny part of that -- the therapist is only visible when you click on the sim that is nuts.  How funny is that?\n\nOh... remember the ghosts?  They're actually pretty creepy in this one.  They move things and will animate other things as well.  Apparently, they have a certain colored glow for how they died.  Haven't figured that one out yet.\n\nBuilding the homes is pretty cool, too.  Yup, you can actually put in a basement, but you have to dig a hole first and that kind of thing.  Windows can be put in for multiple floors and staircases are customized.  I miss the circular staircase, though.  What else is new?  Lots of furniture, customizing the roofs yourself, which is definitely a bit tricky if you're not creatively adept and spraying the grass different shades... i.e., brown, green, light green... like that.  Learning how to build the houses takes as much time as learning the new Sims habits.\n\nGood stuff?  You want the \"fun\" stuff?  Oh, the Sims are a LOT more flirty, little more R-rated but never oversteps the line.  \"Playing in bed\" is no longer -- it's called Woo Hoo!  You can \"goose\" a sim and flirt different ways.. you can have Woo Hoo in the hot tub and apparently in public as well (by the way, you can travel to little park areas like in the expansion packs of the first Sims.)  I may point out that there is a difference between Woo Hoo and Try for a Baby.  Woo Hoo I believe is w/contraceptives (LOL) otherwise, try for a baby seems to be no problem as my Sims get knocked up pretty quick.\n\nOh!  The neighborhoods... you have three different neighborhoods (and you can customize how they look... there are quite a few similarities between these neighborhoods and SimCity... hmmm.... I wonder why?):)  Well, you can add all kinds of things... rocks, wildflowers, ocean surf, rainbows, clouds...etc.  The only thing I wish is that you can see this stuff when in the homes.  Example?  You place 20 giant rocks in the lot next to a Sim home -- inside the sim home you see nothing but a plain.  Maybe they'll fix it later, who knows?\n\nBut each neighborhood has a \"story.\"  I got the guidebook and apparently, you should visit certain houses first before others.  They have a chain reaction.  But that's if you want to actually work on the storyline.  You dont' have to.  The funny one would be the Strangeville neighborhood which Bella Goth has been sighted in (LOL) and there's a crashed space ship nearby.  People do get abducted by aliens, yup, but it's the MEN that get impregnanted.  That's pretty hysterical.\n\nAnything bad?  Just a few.  It does play like the first, but technologically-wise, we're not up to artificial intelligence, yet, so I'm pretty happy with what they've got.  There are a few glitches in the game I've come across already (i.e., a fire starts, fireman comes... but the fire just keep burning for eternity.)  As for loading it, I had some pretty big problems and couldn't do it for four hours -- massively ticked me off.  Ended up returning the discs to get new ones and they worked fine.  Got problems running it?  I'd recommend checking their site for tech issues.  It helped me.  but I have no doubt a patch will be coming out soon.\n\nOh, and there's no rain.  I checked and waited.  Apparently, they've had problems getting the rain to work so they took it out.\n\nGreat game.  Lots of fun -- can't wait what to find out next.", "summary": "Makes the original Sims Look like Pong", "unixReviewTime": 1095724800}

After years of trying to perfect Resident Evil 4 (including at least two completely scrapped attempts), it hit the Gamecube like a storm and completely changed how people viewed the venerable survival horror series.  It was as perfect a game as I've seen recently, with amazing pacing, the perfect meaty length, intense action sequences and enough horror to still call it a horror game.  In an ironic twist, Gears of War took inspiration from Resident Evil 4 and now Capcom returns the favor by taking some inspiration from Gears of War for Resident Evil 5.  Unfortunately, they didn't take it far enough.\n\nIf I had to sum up my Resident Evil 5 experience in a few words, I'd say it was frustrating, exciting, annoying, action-packed, thrilling and ultimately a little bit unsatisfying.  If RE4 threw out the entire kitchen but kept the sink (the horror), RE5 ditches the sink entirely.  And that's where my problems come in.\n\nBefore I get too far ahead, the story is probably the weakest part, unfortunately.  As convoluted and B-grade as it is, part of my love for the RE series stems from the stories.  Here we have Chris Redford and his partner Sheva, members of the BSAA, who are in Africa trying to track down a man named Irving.  Of course, the area they go into is swarming with a new form of Plagas-infected townspeople and Chris has ulterior motives in going to Africa that ties into his backstory.  The story is kind of a mess and is easily the weakest in the series.  The best part comes at the end as it brings closure to some story fragments started way back in 1998.\n\nA lot of people complain about the controls.  While the emphasis on action seems counter-balanced by the stiff controls, its the same control scheme used in RE4.  And that's fine with me, for the most part.  The further reliance on action does tend to add some aggravating moments but I honestly didn't realize there was a control problem through most of the game.  The action sequences run from very good to just decent, with a few set pieces that really deserve attention.  And of course the boss fights are hugely over-the-top and add some of the best moments of the game in terms of variety.\n\nNo, my biggest grief with the game is that it feels like a strange alien copy of a series I've loved for over 10 years.  Where's the horror, I kept asking myself.  Where are the scares?  I would have been satisifed with a cheap window-shattering scare by the time the game was over.  Everything just felt so...run of the mill.  Most of the great parts of Resident Evil 4 were recycled.  The beginning sequence where you're chased around for a time, moving quietly to avoid detection, QTEs, fights against giant rejects from Lord of the Rings...it all felt so familiar.  And it doesn't do much much to push the genre forward.\n\nIf anything, it takes a few steps back.  I love co-op as much as the next gamer, but horror is based about feelings of isolation and it's hard to have that feeling when not only is there another person with you, but it seems as if at any time, the cavalry can arrive to shoot missiles and provide backup.  Playing through the game with a real person is a fine and fun experience, but a lot of people will be forced to play with the sometimes good A.I. partner and that's a shame.\n\nSheva, as controlled by the computer, does an adequate job most of the time.  She's a rapid healer and isn't selfish with ammo.  But she also is guided by AI principles and does some absolutely stupid things at the worst possible time.  Like jumping off a cliff and running back, through the final boss who insta-kills her (and ends your game).  Try having that happen to you three or four times.  I have never been so frustrated at a game, but when death is sometimes predetermined based on the whims of your partner and not actual skill, my frustration meter goes through the roof.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my ten (definitely not the 17 of RE4) hours spent in Resident Evil 5's twisted world.  It provided enough variety and fun to warrant a couple play throughs, especially with a human partner.  However, I never got the giddy feeling I felt playing Resident Evil, RE2 or RE4.  I'd definitely recommend giving it a go because it does offer some great moments toward the end of the story and surprised me with how it ended, but don't go in with the same expectations of RE4.  Here's hoping that Resident Evil 6, with its proposed \"complete reboot,\" puts the kitchen sink back in.", "summary": "Decent action game, terrible survival horror game", "unixReviewTime": 1237852800}

In 2008, you'd think a game developer would understand how to make fluid controls, especially for the PC. Not the idiots who completely screwed up this game. The controls just destroy the entire game. The worst part for me is, in third person mode, you CANNOT USE YOUR MOUSE to move your character! You can only move him with the direction keys. Just about every modern game I can think of with a third person mode allows you to turn your character with the mouse. Not since the late 90s have I encountered a game that won't let you do this. It is incredibly unnatural and makes things amazingly difficult.

I held off buying the game until the Enhanced Edition was released, so I can't comment on the differences, but The Witcher 2 is an incredible solo RPG and follows up - and improves upon - the original better than most sequels ever do.\n\nThere are already numerous reviews detailing the game, so rather than tell you more of the same, I'll just add a couple of thoughts.  First of all, despite meeting the system requirements listed on the box, I found the game to be nearly unplayable on an old 2.6 GHz Core 2 Quad with 6GB DDR2 and nVidia GeForce 9400GT running Windows 7 64-bit.  Not exactly a gaming workhorse, but it didn't struggle at all with numerous other games, and TW2 brought it nearly to a standstill.  Upgrading the video card to a slightly more modern 630GT made all the difference in the world, allowing me to run at a higher resolution and with more \"eye candy\" enabled without sacrificing performance.  (I also added 2GB of RAM for a total of 8GB, which I doubt made any particular difference.)\n\nThe gameplay is fluid and fast-paced, the world is beautiful and detailed, and character interaction is some of the best I've encountered in an RPG.  Sure, you can't carry on a conversation with every single NPC or stray very far off the beaten path (eg. Elder Scrolls, Gothic, etc.) but rarely does anything feel off-limits.  Speaking of limits, there is virtually no limit to the carnage, cursing, nudity and sexual content, with the latter also being several levels beyond the \"sex cards\" of the original.  As other reviewers have made quite clear, this is ABSOLUTELY NOT FOR KIDS.  The look and feel of TV series like Spartacus and Game of Thrones matched with wildly branching storyline make for an exceptionally immersive experience.\n\nThere is only one glaring complaint I have about TW2, although it's not unique to this game.  I feel as though \"boss\" fights have become a tired gimmick, but without revealing too much, there are definitely some battles where all of Geralt's combat abilities are basically thrown out the window in favor of just repeating a single manuever over and over.  I can think of several such encounters where I felt as though learning the ins and outs of equipment enhancement, alchemy (especially bomb-making) and sign-casting were wasted efforts.  Geralt would seem to become less responsive as well, even though this was neither a performance issue or a legitimate combat effect.  Fortunately, this is largely offset by the otherwise enjoyable combat, but save often to avoid major headaches.\n\nAs I understand it, a third game in the series is now in the works, but having just finished this one and having numerous other plot directions available - and many other games to play before then - I'll probably wait for The Witcher 3 to be offered in an Enhanced Edition as well.", "summary": "A worthy successor to the epic original.", "unixReviewTime": 1372118400}

They now want me to change my account , abandon the player name I have since about 2002, forfeit all my unlocks, my stats and sit on my duff until they find a solution???  I don't think so.  THIS CRAP HAS CLASS ACTION SUITE WRITTEN ALL OVER IT.\n\nDO NOT BUY INTO THIS OBVIOUS, RUSH TO MARKET, BETA RELEASE AND BETA MULTIPLAYER CLIENT AND SPEND GOOD MONEY JUST TO FRUSTRATE AND PUNISH YOURSELF.

Odin Sphere's graphics are second to none, and the story line's nothing to laugh at, either.\n\nThis game is actually about a small girl who finds some story books in her attic. All of the stories are intertwined, but each book is about one of the 5 main characters in particular (save for the last, which involve all characters). The setup is unique. Unless you play through all 5 of the books, the story is filled with plot holes and time gaps.\n\nThe story follows the war between the Aesir (the Valkyries) and the Vanir (the Fairy folk), both attempting to control a device known as the Crystallization Cauldron and its ultimate role in the destruction of the world. The main plot follows the paths traveled by five main characters: a Valkyrie cast out of her nation, a prince turned into a beast, a fairy who would succeed her mother as queen, a knight who's soul resides in darkness, and a princess from a nation long since destroyed by the Cauldron.\n\nTo watch the game is to watch a masterpiece come alive. It's a 2D side-scrolling RPG, something unheard of on the PS2. It can become incredibly difficult at times, particularly so if you get caught in a mass of enemies attacking from both sides. Item space is also limited. It's a hard lesson to learn that items should be used, not saved for later. But, since dropped items are commonplace, you don't have to feel so bad about using that healing potion now instead of saving it for the boss fight. The food growing system can either kill you or save your life, depending on how you use it. You can eat food that you grow to regain lost HP, but you leave yourself open to attack. This choice can be difficult to make if you're near death. Finally, the alchemy system has 26 recipes for you to learn, which means Gwendolyn (the first character you play as) won't have as much of an edge as Velvet (the last one).\n\nSome people will find this game just as frustrating as others enjoy it. If you enjoy tactical adventure/RPG games that require some quick thinking and fast reflexes, then you'll absolutely love this game. Otherwise, you may only find yourself frustrated.

While the mechanics of Danger Girl can't compare to Syphon Filter's highly intuitive, instantly comfortable controls, it has to its advantage a cast of great characters, good artwork, enjoyable voice work, and the Danger Girl franchise, which gives this game a more varied backdrop than usual.  Unfortunately the controls are really quite hard to grasp -- the \"toggle\" quality of the crouch and aim options (most games, Medal of Honor and Syphon Filter, let you aim only when you hold down the button, which makes more sense) makes controlling your character all the slower.  And your character onscreen really moves at a pathetic speed, so that most of the time evading enemy attack (and spotting the enemy in the first place) becomes annoyingly difficult.  What bugs me the most is the lack of a checkpoint system in this game, and the environments often are not what they seem -- eg. you can see a crack between the tree and the wall, but you won't be able to move past it, and your character will \"freeze\" if she hits a surface).

I really liked how game sets off. You are about to protect humans as lower caste from demonic high caste (I like being good guy). It is not raining anymore. There are kids in the game and normal people. There is Matrix-Dune-BladeRunnerish  feel to the ambient.\n\nAND THAT'S IT. Technically, You have to start leveling up from level one and bying mantras from the beginning. No importing of old characters into  new game. Even mantra grid is not the same so that you can navigate easily if you played part one. Even if you had 3 million macca (money) at the end of DDS1 and spells like Magic Repel, Dyne elemental spells, rich inventory, it is ALL GONE!!! Sniff!!! NO DEVOURER , TOO!!!\n\nLabyrinths are vast like in first part, bosses are smart, there are puzzles with switches...as much as I liked first part because of it, second one is too similar and I said 'NOT AGAIN' after seeing same schemes/templates again.\n\nI decided that this game be my last Atlus title to complete but I am really bored. If I don't post more in my review, it's probably because I stopped playing this sequel  after JUST four hours. Too similar to part one and no fun.\n\nThey should have done FF type of thing or SMT Nocturne type of thing, similar environment and 'weirdness' in game  but new characters connected little better into story of part one. This way, you can learn after 2 hours what was point of DDS one and loose interest.\n\nDo my impressions originate in fact I beat Persona 3 and Digital Devil with small pause in between, so I got bored of Atlus RPGs?\n\nIF YOU STILL DECIDE TO PLAY,\n\n---READ SOLUTIONS TO ANSWERING DIALOGUES. HERE, YOU CAN MAKE MISTAKE LIKE THAT\n\n---CIELO AND GALE ARE ONLY ONES WHO WON'T LEAVE YOU, OTHERS LEAVE AND COME BACK\n\n---GET MANTRA GRID FROM FAQ OFF THE WEB OR BUY GUIDE\n\n---GET DEVOURER, NO DEVOURING NO ATMA POINTS\n\n---IF YOU CAN GET CRIMSON BOX AND HAVE 10000 IN CASH, SAVE, BUY BOX IN CITY AND HOPE TO GET RICH RING. MONEY IS SCARCE!!!\n\n---GET ESOTHERIC MANTRA 1 UNLOCKED QUICK, IT IS PURPLE ONE , DOWN RIGHT OF PROTECTION OR IN OTHER WORDS SOUTH OF DEVOURER.\n\n---READING FAQ I UNDERSTOOD THAT YOU HAVE TO DO MOST IMP THINGS BEFORE COMING TO SUN. SUN HAS BIG AND SMALL NODES AND SHOP AND NODES ARE EQUAL TO TERMINALS. SUN IS GOOD TO LEVEL UP, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE NULL CHARM, DYNE MAGICS, NULL DEATH AND EXPEL. YOU NEEDED THEM TO BEAT AIRPORT ANYWAY.\n\n----------------------------IMPRESSIONS AFTER BEATING GAME-----------\nGOOD\nLast level was WOW. I liked the ending, I liked how main boss looks like. Thumbs up for graphic designers. If whole game had been like this...\n\nBAD\nYou spend a lot of time , 50% , to level up and when you have right spells and good stats, you can devastate next boss, and then you read FAQ to see what you need for next boss... I wish I didn't have to hunt for Mantras , game system where you level up Personas or Parasites by using them or getting experience was better.\n\nBOSSES I BEAT, SPOILERS AHEAD:\n\n**Elephant guy: Have EARTH REPEL and TERA.\n\n**Eight arms: attack w whatever except 'attack' command and do MEDIA\n\n**Horse-like guy in concentration camp: have MEDIA, FORCE REPEL and ZIO ready. For me , chars were at LVL 13. No need to level up to 16\n\nAFTER THIS GET MUTUAL KARMA FOR EVERYONE, SPEND 2 HOURS OR SO\n\n**HELIODROME, INSIDE KARMA SOCIETY, TRIO OF MONSTERS TAKE ONE\n\nArgilla must have tera or terazi AND media, Roland must have Agilao, Cielo Media and some attack. Roland shoots Agilao to kill dog-like creature who heals (left side of screen); Argilla does tera against snake woman and media sometimes, Cielo supports. Don't leave snake last, she does DYNE!!! Kill healer=the dog , with fire, paralelly hit snakewoman with tera and kill stone-like guy last. SET MUTUAL KARMA FOR GALE AND SERPH.\n\n*TRIO TaKE TWO\nWatch out! They will hit with Zio-type Magic Combo so have someone do Void Electricity.\n\n*FIRE BOSS WITH TWO FIRE DOGS\nKill dogs, do Void Fire. IF YOU DO REPEL FIRE BOSS' ENERGY WITH RECOVER. Keep using this strategy till boss is down.\n\n**Big green frog:\nPhase one use Zanma/Force magic + Electric magic,\nAfter forg swallows your companion use Earth and bolt\nAt the end, use Fire + Electric offensive spell\n\nBoth my Argilla and Cielo had heal magics\n\n**Mechanical bosses, three of them:\nOne char uses void fire, Cielo Bolt type magic, and Argilla heal and buff magic\n\n**End of Power Plant level, when lotsa spear an shield monsters jump out in a cut scene!\n\nBoss' weakness is fire, but helpers cast void fire. Anyway, get Gale, Argilla and Roland. Roland uses Void Electricity, Argilla heals or takes out helpers with Tera (Terazi for instance) and Gale uses Force, it hits both boss and helpers. If you have extra turn and Void Fire expired , hit boss with Roland's Agi.\n\n***BIG FIRE MONSTER\nJust have someone use Void Fire and Zio will be good if I remember\n\n***Chernobog\n\nBefore you get to him, have null nerve.\n\nChernobog IMITATES you . Get Mediarama and DON'T get nasty spells like Hama, Mudo and so on. Have Null Death and, if you for instance play with Gale and Cielo, have Cielo cast Elec Drain or Elec Void since Gale is weak to Electricity...make a team so that nobody has attack that could hurt comrade, since Chernobog will imitate you and use mentioned fact.\n\nBOSSES AT SUN ARE REPLAY OF SOME DDS ONE BOSSES.\n\n***Asura Camaztotz - this one is little different\n\nYou don't have to wait while he is in defensive stance: use Terazi or Teradyne.\n\n***Meganada\nYou need Elec Drain and Void Phys. When he changes appearance, you change defensive magic. It can be tricky, you need Null Ailments on all 3 chars.\n\n***Brahma\n\nIt is nice to have around 15 healing units and same number of magic point restore units. Somas are also welcome, although I didn't use much.\n\nCharacters and what is important (Im not 100% sure for all spells):\nCHARACTERS THAT ARE AT LEFT SIDE OF SCREEN:\n\nHEAT\nEQUIP Null Expell & Fire Drain\n\nCielo\nElec Drain, Ice Drain, Null Expell, Null Death, Null Ailment, Dekunda, Force Amp, Zandyne\n\nArgilla\nNull Panic, Null Mute, Null Charm (MOST IMPORTANT), Null Death, Null Nerve, OR Null ailment, it substitutes all five. Add  Dekunda, Earth drain\n\nSeraph, character you don't change, the one in themiddle\n\nBufudyne, Null Expell, Null Death, Null Ailment,Dekaja, Ice Amp, Mind Charge , Last Word, I did Mind Charge last word together\n\nGale, to right\nMediarahan, Null Expell, Null Death, Null Ailment, Zandyne, Force Drain, Force Amp, Debilitate\n\nTactic is that LEFT character drains brahma's elemental attack, Seraph does Mind Charge and Last Words and Gale does Mediarahan or Zandyne. If you get Eternal Zero-ed , you do dekaja, dekunda, skip Gale and do Drain magic.\n\nBrahma has five fases:\n1. Fire using fase(dominantly)\n2. Force using fase(dominantly)\n3. Earth using fase(dominantly)\n4. Electricity using fase(dominantly)\n5. Ice using fase(dominantly)\n\nAll of my characters were about level 73. Seraph's magic stat was around 70 and other stats about 50.\n\nI know you could read FAQ instead of my post, but I am trying to show some things that FAQ writers overlooked or more economical solution.", "summary": "Please note I answered RATE GAME QUESTION directly after finishing part one", "unixReviewTime": 1213660800}

In the case of the Dreamcast, that problem can easily be attributed to Sega wussing out on releasing their own gun peripheral in light of the Columbine massacre. Thankfully, a number of third-party companies were willing to pick up the slack, and, thus, by spending some extra cash, you can play this highly enjoyable frag-a-thon the way it was MEANT to be played.\nHouse of the Dead 2 gets my vote as the best \"traditional\" (meaning you kill things) light gun game available on a home system (Namco's Point Blank series, I think, has it beat in terms of potential enjoyability, but that's another kettle of fish). It's also one of the hardest. Even on the easiest setting with maximum health and credits, blasting your way through it is no small feat. Most enemies can sustain multiple shots, and dealing with several of them at once while not getting cut or bitten or tackled or whatever will challenge all but the fastest trigger fingers. For even more of a challenge, just try nailing all of those agonizingly evasive bonus items that appear when you shoot barrels, crates, etc.\nHouse of the Dead 2 is not content to force you down the same path every time you play. Depending on how many civillians you rescue, and which ones, you will be sent in different directions within the same stage and the bosses will vary their attacks accordingly, so it's impossible to see everything the game has to offer in one session. Of course, the civillians are typical helpless weenies, begging pathetically for mercy and cowering in corners (one guy even dies from a single kick to the rib cage if you don't save him in time...WIMP!). Their voice acting, as well as that of the heroes and villains, is unsurprisingly weak, but the B-movie quality sort of adds to the feel of the game.\nGraphics are mightily impressive, and pretty atmospheric, too; the look of a gloomy European town is captured quite well.\nThe soundtrack, while not exactly stellar, is certainly passable.\nThere's also a training mode where you must accomplish tasks like blowing zombies off a moving car. It's nowhere near as fun as the main game because there's really no margin for error, but it's a nice touch nonetheless.\nPointing a gun (plastic or not) at the screen and blasting away is a wonderfully primal, visceral video game experience, and you'd be hard pressed to find a better excuse to do it than this. The high level of difficulty may turn some people off, but for those of us who can only go for so long without shooting something, it's a real treat as well as a great reason to own a Dreamcast.", "summary": "A chunk-blowing good time", "unixReviewTime": 999302400}

Though Roberta Williams did not call this #8 in the series in an attempt to not betray the fans, it has become known as such, but it doesn't matter. KQ is definitely ended here and with good reason. It is a weak, straggling story, badly constructed and throwing away many a good chance. The entire premise is too thin, the puzzles too slight, the construction and animation too crude, the music too dull and uninspired (though it has a couple nice tracks).\n\nFor years we were taught to solve puzzles through non-violent solutions, and resort to violence only when necessary. This game flies in the face of the established vogue and is a total disappointment. It's really a shame that what became the last of the series was the last because it wasn't true to form. The puzzles consist mostly of \"look at the object and then figure out how to manipulate\". The hero instantly resorts to theivery, justifies it and doesn't develop at all. He doesn't even have an ending; when the story is over, there is no ending where everything gets tied up and we talk about what it meant. It just ...ends, like an antique video game. As if the programmers didn't give this any thought. What becomes of Connor? Of Sarah? Of anyone? We don't know.\n\nBut by the end, we don't care anymore. This game should not have been released under the guise of a \"King's Quest\".", "summary": "*What* were they thinking?", "unixReviewTime": 1199232000}

There are 3 of them, so you have to be careful.  You reach into your backpack, and lob a gernade right in the middle of them, they try to scatter but in a suffocating blast all three of them are gone.  You're next order of business is to carry the bodies off the road to hide them in the bushes. Next you confiscate the ammo, and disguise yourself with one of the uniforms that doesn't have blood on it.  Now all you got to do is make it past the high ranking officer who will recognize you if you get too close....\n\nSo there you have it.  Another level of Death To Spies.  How is the game overall?  To be honest it's a little bland.  You take the role of a Russian operative.  And you perform a number of missions.  The game is cool because it does give you a number of real life options.  You can sneak past guards, or try to knock them out, or use chloroform on them, or steal a uniform and walk past them, or you could whistle to distract them, or just steal a truck and run them over.  The game does carry a lot of limitless possibilities.\n\nThat being said, the game is still pretty linear in the long run.  You have a set number of goals you must accomplish with every mission.  But at least the interface does a good job of keeping you informed so you're not lost as what to do next.  There are a number of weapons to choose from, but at the same time stealth is usually your best bet.  The game is realistic on the fact that even with your health you can't take too many bullets before you give up the ghost.  The controls are a little too sensitive to me.  So much that when I closed out the game my mouse felt slow on the desktop.  But this doesn't detract from the game.\n\nThe story line is based off real events as well.  But frankly I found the story really confusing.  I do enjoy history, but I know nothing about Russian history during WWII so I was in the dark, and kind of bored watching the cut scenes.  Although I do admit that the graphics are pretty good.\n\nPROS: Good graphics.  Tense missions make you feel like you're there.  Good shooter scenarios mixed with stealth make the game work on more than one level.\n\nCONS: Nothing makes the game stand out.  Same old, same old.  Hit detection is iffy sometimes.  Story line is really obscure, and frankly kind of boring.  Game is forgettable in the long run.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Game is very mediocre at best.  It emersed me for a while, but not for long.  It's a nice little piece of fluff.  But if you buy it, don't rush to the store, or pay full price.  Try to get this one for cheap.  Don't go looking for much here, and you won't be disappointed.", "summary": "Mediocre Spy Game", "unixReviewTime": 1194048000}

But calling it an entry to the named series is almost insulting.\n\nHere's the thing.  I am not a heavy gamer.  In fact I actually quit console gaming in about 2013 because I saw RPGs were going the wrong way.  Games like The Witcher are not true RPGs, they're basically replicas of the same thing we had with the Elder Scrolls series.  That's NOT what I want.\n\nI want \"boy finds legendary weapon and saves the world\" stories.  Doesn't matter if they're turn-based, although I prefer turn-based in some cases, there are some action RPGs I enjoyed - I played every Kingdom Hearts except one and Star Ocean was always a favorite (until the 5th entry) - but I want the epic story.  I want stories that are likely never going to happen in the real world.\n\nThe moment I saw this game's trailer, I knew I would own it.  I don't regret that decision. But there are a few questionable design decisions.\n\nI own PS4 and One S.  I bought it for the One S for a single reason: the controller battery life.  I can easily game for over 20 hours with the Xbox One's controller.  PS4?  Dead in 6.  That wasn't acceptable.  Also, I don't like the gimmicky touch pad on the PS4 controller and was afraid Square Enix would try to use it, to disastrous effect.  Control felt more comfortable on One S controller, as well.\n\nMuch has been made of the graphics; I'm telling you now, as an owner of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/LG-Electronics-43UH6100-43-Inch-4K-Ultra-HD-Smart-LED-TV-2016-Model/dp/B01CF07L54/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">LG Electronics 43UH6100 43-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV (2016 Model)</a>, there's absolutely little wrong with the graphics on a properly calibrated TV.  They're crisp where it matters, beautiful to a fault especially when it rains in the game.  Are they flawless?  No, but from 20 feet away you really can't tell a difference except that the PS4 version is slightly sharper and the black levels a bit deeper.\n\nTo the game.  It definitely feels like Grand Theft Auto meets Final Fantasy, except that GTA doesn't force you to gas up the car and Final Fantasy XV doesn't have hookers.  But same basic idea with quests, same basic idea with going from place to place, even the map feels a little bit like Liberty City/Los Santos/San Andreas.  This isn't a bad thing, but by no means does it ever scream \"Final Fantasy\" at all except at points you're interacting with chocobos or summons or magic - or if the right song plays on the car music player.\n\nThe Deluxe Edition comes with the Kingsglave movie, which happens in parallel with the first few hours of the game.  Watching this is not mandatory, but it's highly recommended, if for no other reason than to learn about the backstory.  Some of it is replayed in the game, but there's no audio or spoken text, only flashbacks, which may not give the full sense.  You also get three downloadable items, one of which (Masamune) was easily outclassed by a weapon that can be found for free in the same place it was in the demo - Three Valleys.  The Gold Chocobo skin (if you preordered) is okay, but the Leviathan skin is a masterpiece.  The Royal Rainment outfit bumps stats a bit and looks nice on Noctis.\n\nWhen starting the game you're forced to install 50GB of data.  While the game will let you start at around 50% completed, all you can do is an Open Battle deal. You can't really START the game until it's fully downloaded, which is annoying.  It makes me wonder why you have to keep the disc if it's just going to install the whole thing to the drive.  I don't want download-only, because Xbox Fitness taught me that you don't really own downloaded games.  You're \"leasing\" them and are subject to lose them whenever they feel like it.  No...I want to OWN what I paid for.\n\nIf you're considering whether to get this or the PS4 version know that you can't go wrong with either, except the framerate issues that are on PS4 do not apply to the One S.  The One S has slightly lower resolution, but it still looks amazing.\n\nOn the web there are various bug stories.  I have not encountered any bugs or freezing.  My theory is that the downloaded version was corrupt, causing this problem, where the physical version was clean.  That's only a theory.  No issues here though.\n\nIt's a solid game, not really a true Final Fantasy, but certainly a great game and worth playing.", "summary": "They should have released this as \"Final Fantasy: Road Trip\".", "unixReviewTime": 1480809600}

It comes with a messenger bag, a very small Chris figure, a BSAA patch, an Africa necklace, and a bonus DVD. The game also comes in a very beautiful metal case. RE5, the game, is excellent and well worth $60, but the real question for this version is \"Is it worth the extra $30 for the other stuff?\". For some it may be, below is my opinion of the included items.\n\nThe included DVD has some nice extras, but nothing too major. The trailer is definitely not a selling point.\n\nThe Chris Redfield figure is about 2\" tall and fairly detailed given its size.\n\nThe BSAA patch is identical to the one Chris wears on his shoulder in the game and is good quality.\n\nThe necklace is kind of bland. The writing on it really just looks like scribbles and most people who see it will wonder why you're wearing an Africa necklace (especially if you're as white as me).\n\nThe Tricell bag is the highlight. It is nice enough quality to actually use and is standard size. I walk to work and am using it to carry a few documents and my lunch. There are no pockets on the inside and the design is pretty simple, just the tricell decal and logo on the front, but it looks alright.\n\nAs I've already stated the metal case the game comes in is beautiful and a vast improvement on the standard plastic case.\n\nThe only reason I don't rate this higher is because for the extra money, $30, you could buy another, budget title, 360 game. If you're a really big fan of all things Resident Evil, or want to use/display the items it comes with it might still be worth the extra.\n\nAgain, the game is awesome!", "summary": "Game is great, but the extras are a little overpriced.", "unixReviewTime": 1237161600}

The down side is that you really only end up having the same mix and style of fighting/shooting, main mission and side missions, big, detailed open-world maps, and character skill improvements adopted from RPGs. The only thing that really changes is the scenery - the environment - and the quality of voice acting, artwork, cut scenes, and engaging storyline.

The voices are not in sync with the character's lips. The music is uninspiring. The graphics freeze every 30 seconds, but the voices keep going. It take the game about 5 second to catch up with the voices. It's definitely NOT Skyrim. The environments are not really detailed. The aren't rich and inviting. I thought that there would be more of an open world, but this is not a massive RPG like Skyrim. You follow a path, kill demons and such long the path, and fight the boss at the end. Sometimes there is loot, sometimes not. You can press the R3 button to locate codex and loot. But I didn't see anything happen to my map or the game screen when I pressed R3. The attacks are simple and uninspiring. I thought your skill attack would be more specular. They're all run of the mill.\n\nThe music seems so pedestrian. There is no passion or force. After awhile the music got on my nerves.\n\nThe character customization was ok. You can change your face and hair, but that's it. You can't change your body type. So not getting taller or fatter or skinnier. There are limited choices for hair styles. I was playing as the male elf and there was no option for a beard. The hairstyles are ugly too. There are limited voice choices as well.\n\nI played what felt like the first chapter. We went to this temple and fought this huge demon. Then my character woke up in a bed. I go outside to explore and the game exits back to my PS3 home screen. I've had to call Amazon and have my game returned for a refund. Maybe in a year or so--when the game is fix-- I will buy it again. I can't believe Bioware and EA would release this hot-mess of a game. It's just horrible. What suck even more is that I've been waiting for so long to play this game. And this is what I get.

This game is loosely based on the original Fantasia short where Mickey Mouse is \"conducting\" the stars and the heavens as the Sorcerer's Apprentice. Your goal throughout the game is to match patterns on-screen with your arm and hand movements. It's more like Dance Dance Revolution or Guitar Hero than \"real dancing games\" like Just Dance or Dance Central in that it's really more about pattern matching than dancing.\n\nOn the positive side, the use of the Kinect 2.0 is excellent. The game detects your hand movements more precisely than any other game I've played on any other platform. Before you start the game, you'll go through some clapping exercises to make sure the sound and picture are perfectly synchronized.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful as well. From the opening screen, there's a silhouetted version of you on an orchestral podium, similar to the opening scenes of Fantasia where Leopold Stokowski is introduced. Your silhouette will continue to appear at the bottom of the screen throughout as you \"conduct\" in different \"Realms\". While I wouldn't go so far as say that the graphics match what you'd find in Disney's traditional or computer generation animation titles, they did produce graphics that seem to take good advantage of the Xbox One's advanced capabilities--and managed to avoid the sluggishness that plagued games like Dance Central on the Xbox 360.\n\nThe song selection is also very eclectic. I love the fact that they included some classical pieces in a nod to the original Fantasia, but also included modern pieces as well. When you start the program the entire song library is locked, but you can turn \"Party Mode\" on to view and play all the songs in a group setting. Here's a list of all the artists and songs that come as part of the physical game.\n\nLady Gaga - Applause - Difficulty 4/5\nNew Order - Blue Monday - Difficulty 4/5\nQueen - Bohemian Melody - Difficulty 1/5\nMozart - Eine Kleine Nachtmusik (Allegro) - Difficulty 1/5\nDepeche Mode - Enjoy the Silence - Difficulty 3/5\nGorrilaz - Feel Good Inc - Difficulty 3/5\nJimi Hendrix - Fire - Difficulty 5/5\nCee Lo Green - Forget You - Difficulty 2/5\nVivaldi - The Four Seasons: Winter, 1.

Allegro Con Fuoco - Difficulty 3/5\nDrake - Take Care (ft. Rhianna) - Difficulty 2/5\nJ.S. Bach - Toccata and Fugue in D Minor - Difficulty 3/5\nThe Flaming Lips - Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots - Difficulty 2/5\nDavid Bowie - Ziggy Stardust - Difficulty 4/5\n\nThere are also two songs by video game musician Inon Zur (Main Theme and Scout's Song) that need to be unlocked in Story Mode.\n\nOf course, there's plenty of downloadable content as well. But the mix that comes with your original purchase price is a pretty good one that should keep you satisfied for many hours. .\n\nAs I mentioned, there are two ways to play the game: Story Mode and Party Mode. Story Mode is required to unlock all the songs and features of the game.\n\nOnce you start \"Story Mode\" you're brought to the workshop of Yen Sid, the Sorcerer in the original deluxe short, whom most Fantasia enthusiasts will recognize as an alter-ego of Walt Disney (try spelling his name backwards). They quickly get Yen Sid out of the way but then replace him with an impish young girl with a Fantasia-looking cap named \"Scout\" who, like Mickey, was a washed-up former apprentice and serves as your tour guide through the rest of the story. For some reason she grated on me as much as the impish, obnoxious dancers in Dance Central. I don't know what it is about Xbox game developers, but developing likable character doesn't seem to be one of their strong suits.\n\n\"Story Mode\" itself is pretty contrived, as if the developers focused mostly on the actual gameplay and threw together the story as an afterthought. The \"Story\" is mainly a way to get you to play through all the songs.\n\nTo play the game itself, you select a song and then you'll stand up and \"conducting\" it by following on-screen cues. You start out learning the basic motions of the game. There are \"push cues\" where you punch your screen forward with either or both hands as a \"sphere\" hits the screen. There's a \"sweep cues\" where you sweep your hands in the direction of an on-screen arrow. There are \"hold cues\" where you keep your hands raised in a certain place. And then there are combinations where you \"sweep\" then \"hold\". There are \"path cues\" where you push forward and trace the path of the cue. And you'll encounter \"switch cues\" that you hit in the direction of silhouettes of instruments on screen to select or change instrumentation or song styles in the middle of a performance. While the names sound kind of complicated, all the motions are pretty intuitive, similar to the motions a conductor will make on a podium. Hit a cue correctly and the music plays loud, miss one and the music is muted. I have to admit, the first time I played I really felt like Leopold or Mickey on the podium, even if I didn't quite look like it in real life.\n\nThe story continues as you help Scout \"unlock\" the \"Magic\" throughout the world of Fantasia. You're introduced to \"The Muse\", a ball (really a cursor) that you can use to explore the different \"Realms\" (including The Capsule, The Press, The Shoal, The Nation, The Hollow, and The Shadows). Using \"The Muse\" to navigate within the different realms is itself an exercise in frustration, something that seems to be endemic to all Kinect games.\n\nYou're suddenly bombarded with confusing phrases like \"Magic Fragments\", \"Composition Spells\", \"Hot Spot Recordings\", \"The Noise\", and \"Mixes\". This is where I started to have issues with the game. I know they chose these exotic names to try to make the game sound \"cool\" and \"mysterious\", but what they really did is just create confusion. I felt like I had to learn a foreign language here just to play the game.\n\nBut after some trial and error you'll start to figure out what's going on. In a \"Realm\", you need to unlock a certain number of \"Magic Fragments\", by completing tasks such as finding one of 11 hidden \"Hot Spots\", by unlocking \"Mixes\", by unlocking and using \"Composition Spells, or by otherwise completing song goals. Collect enough \"Magic Fragments\" and you clear each realm of \"The Noise\" (which is evidently something bad).\n\n\"Composition Spells\" are basically ways you can create audio samples visually--all with your arms and hands. For example, a Composition Spell called \"Sound Sketcher\" allows you to move your arms and hands up and down to play a series of notes on a sphere, which you \"save\" by putting your arms to your side. You don't have the precise control that a real composer would have, but even by randomly moving your arms and hands you can create some pretty interesting and totally original mixes which will show up as samples throughout songs later in the game.\n\n\"Hot Spots\" are a little less interesting. You basically need to hunt and peck through screens to find \"hidden\" objects which you can wave your hand over to play notes and create a \"Hot Spot Recording\". This seemed kind of pointless; it's as if the game developers asked themselves \"What can I do to artificially prolong Story Mode so users don't finish it right away\".\n\nIn addition, each song also has three \"Mixes\" that you'll unlock through the game. For example, you can hear Antonin Dvorak's New World Symphony performed by a Big Band, or Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody set to heavy metal.\n\nWhat makes thing interesting is that these different things that will let you customize your sound and literally make the music unique to you. In fact, after particularly good \"performances\" you'll probably want to save the performance for posterity, and what you save will be a creation that's uniquely your own.\n\nI have to say that the more you play this game, the more it grows on you. Again, I won't say there aren't frustrations. The Story itself is tedious, and there is a learning curve for figuring out how to execute the \"cues\" in a way that the Kinect recognizes you. For example, I found after trial and error that I actually have to make Sweep motions a split second before I *think* I should, and I also realized after a while that rather than always making broad sweeping motions I'd be better of making a mix of long and short motions in a way that flows with the music (sort of like a conductor would make small movements for pianissimo and grand movements for fortissimo).\n\nAfter a while, as the motions start becoming more intuitive and natural, you can start literally \"feeling\" the music, and that's when it becomes really enjoyable. It took me about 2 days of playing to finally start scoring in the 80-90% range, and I'll admit that my enjoyment of the game increased as that happened, not because I cared about the score but because I started to really \"experience\" the music. In that sense, this Kinect game starts to realize the vision that Walt Disney had with the original Fantasia--of letting you experience music in a brand new way.\n\nAs for fitness and exercise value of the game, I can't say there's much of that. I do find that when I play for extended periods of time, I do build up a sweat and my heart rate is elevated, particularly on higher difficulty levels where your arms are moving frantically. I'd be kidding myself if I said it was anything close to an aerobic workout. That said, add some wrist weights and move your feet while you play, and suddenly you will have a game that is a lot of fun and can help you tone your arms.\n\nThe game also has a two player mode. As long as you're playing with someone who's had the same level of practice you've had, this can be a ton of fun. It involves cooperation; you each need to hit your own colored cues properly for the song to play, and the choices both of you make with Switch Cues and Composition Spells can influence what the final song sounds like. But it involves competition as well--you're both judged on how well you performed and it can get pretty competitive. And because the Kinect 2.0 is so precise, unlike with games like Just Dance you can't blame a loss on anything except yourself.\n\nOverall, I'd give Fantasia: Music Evolved a solid 4 out of 5. The story mode seems a bit sloppy and lazy at times, but the core game play, graphics, music selection, and motion controls are a decent, if not revolutionary demonstration of what the Xbox One with Kinect 2.0 is capable of.", "summary": "Not without its flaws, but still a fun game that's true to the original Fantasia in letting you experience music in a new way", "unixReviewTime": 1417824000}

I decided to purchase this workout \"game\" because I am a fan of the show, and right now the gym is always slammed... so I wanted something to do at home.  This was my first pick for an interactive trainer that would make home fitness more fun.  Well, after two workouts I'm very hesitant to even say I would recommend this product.  DISCLAIMER: I am fully aware that this is not a game, and I will not review it as such.\n\nUpon starting up two things jump out at the user.  Graphics and Kinect only control.  The graphics are bad for this product, and there is no way around it.  This looks like something that belongs on an original Xbox.  That's okay though because I didn't pay full price, and being that I'm not viewing it as a game.. it didn't bother me.  Secondly, the menus.  I don't know what person was in charge of menus, but I hope they were reassigned.  The menus are EXTREMELY cumbersome and clunky.  It's infuriating to navigate the menus in this workout program.  You will be wishing you could use the controller more than ever.\n\nAfter starting up, you're prompted to do a fitness test.  You do this for 30 minutes, or until the game believes you're having a difficult time with an exercise.  After the test it recommends a program and difficultly.  Then you do the body scan.\n\nThe body scan accuracy is not good if you have the Kinect placed on the wall angled down.  My numbers were not close.  I don't know if the numbers would be more accurate if I had the kinect level with the TV or not, but I'll assume it would.  After that, you can customize your program or jump right into a workout.\n\nThis is where the game starts to become even worse and the misleading part comes in.  I went to customize my workout, and I wanted to add equipment as I have bands and free weights.  Well, there is NO option for free weights at all!  This was EXTREMELY disappointing as this was one of the major reasons I purchased this title.  I added res bands, and they weren't even used in the workout I did.  Which leads me to the next frustrating issue...\n\nI hope there are no Jillian fans out there.  I'm not a fan, but I chose both trainers because I wanted to experience both of them.  Well, big problem and to my surprise... I hear BOB and ONLY Bob bossing me around!  What?  I asked for Jillian AND Bob!  I see Jillian on the screen, yet I only hear Bob!  Every so often you'll hear Jillians voice saying \"Up, down\" or small things of that nature.  This is a Bob only workout.\n\nFinally, the workout is frustrating.  It has no flow.  I have times where I go down to the floor, stand up, floor... all for one exercise each.  It's stupid.  You don't do that when you workout.  If you go to the floor, you do more than one floor exercise before getting up.\n\nI can't recommend this product.  I will gladly edit this review if someone can prove to me that free weights are indeed an option, and they do actually get used.", "summary": "Misleading Description", "unixReviewTime": 1359417600}

As I play it, I come to the conclusion that had the game been released exclusively for the Saturn, it could have been much more well received than it was. True, the main gameplay is all but the same, but all the care that was put into creating the Saturn version truly turned it into a good game.\n\nFirst of all, the control is much better here: both the 3d controller and the model 1 controller work very well with the game. The visuals are one of the most noticeable differences. The environments are vibrant and stunning and there's many little things that really impress me: probably the best example is on the second zone Rusty Ruin: the fog and rain effects on this level are brilliant and really create a mood that just isn't present on the Genesis game. The music is another exceptional part of the game, however, as many people also love the Genesis version's music, it really comes down to personal preference here.\n\nThe absolute best thing about this game however that makes this version superior is the special stages! They have the same objective as Sonic 2 special stages however things are much improved: everything is in full 3d and looks great! You also aren't purely limited to moving left and right in a half pipe, now there are springs, platforms, and awesome corkscrew tunnels. Even when you've got all the chaos emeralds you'll be finding yourself looking for Tails and Knuckles so you can play these levels some more!\n\nThere is one downside to this version which forces me to give 4 stars instead of 5: the loading times!

While there is still some work to be done with the overall user experience in regards to the software, the improvements in usability and fluidity achieved over the past three months has been heartening for the future of the console.\n\nAs far as the experience after three months, I have to say I'm really happy with the console except for the lack of games that interest me.

It took a lot of the systems from Covenant and refined them. For instance, instead of equipping a Crest Chart and getting a set amount of Spells, you now find Stellar Charts. Each one is set up like a constellation with different \"nodes\", which Spells you place in these nodes determine which ones you can use. You can even find an NPC who can power-up or adjust the nodes found on these Charts to fit your liking.\nAlso the different types of Attacks now have more use. For instance, High Angle attacks when used as part of a Combo can knock an enemy upwards so that certain Special Attacks that only hit airborne enemies will work. Likewise, a Knock Down attack will make it so you can hit a Flying enemy with ground-only special attacks. Hard Hit attacks can be used to drain an enemy's Stock Gauge (also a new feature) so that they can't combo your characters.\nIn terms of music this game doesn't disappoint. Combat music is catchy and will get you pumped. Just be patient with music used in the New York area, it can be a little annoying. Lastly, the characters and story aren't quite as developed as those found in Covenant, but that doesn't mean this is a bad game. There are still some badass characters. Shania and Natan are really cool Native American fighters that utilize the power of Fusions and awesome \"Gun\" Fu to take out their enemies.

Unfortunately, not only were these problems not addressed, but more faults seemed to be added in.\n\nFirst off, the game is incredibly short. It took me, maybe, 6 hours to beat the whole thing on the second hardest difficulty. While it does have collectibles throughout the game, I really didn't feel motivated enough to go back through the whole thing again to collect them all. On top of that, it was too easy. Lightsaber fighting is limited to the square button, and occasionally you can mix it up by throwing in a lightning (triangle) or a push (circle). There's really no strategy to it, you just keep mashing those three buttons until all the enemies are dead.\n\nThe game feels incredibly repetitive. Basically the only enemies you fight are Stormtroopers and the game tries to mix it up by making you fight different kinds of Stormtroopers that aren't affected by certain attacks, forcing you to use your force power attacks which are underpowered compared to the last game. There are cool larger enemies to take down using button-combos, but the animation is so repetitive and boring that ultimately you just end up killing them using regular attacks to avoid it.\n\nThe final battle is anti-climactic, and you get to choose 2 endings. I chose the dark side ending, which turned out to be a terrible way to end the game. I'm almost positive the light side ending isn't any better.\n\nThis could possibly be a rent, but definitely not a buy.", "summary": "Disappointing", "unixReviewTime": 1308096000}

I've played this game all the way through and I have to say this was a darn good game. Not one of my favorites in my vast collection, but it was a purchase I don't regret making. I wasn't even considering this game at first. I was 'Halo'ed out so to speak. The last ODST game didn't interest me, and my friends told me to stay away. So I did. Halo 3 was great, but it wasn't amazing or anything either. Multi-player was its saving grace for me. Halo Wars was interesting at best. So I figured this latest installment would be another ho-hum game, but then a store I stepped into had it at a special $20 discount for the game if you bought it on opening week. So I figured, \"Sure. What the heck?\". Boy was I glad I made that purchase.\n\nThis Halo is the prequel to all things Halo, and the story line doesn't disappoint. I like how they made this game more grittier and less flashy than any other Halo I've played. It kind of had that Call of Duty/Medal of Honor/Killzone kind of feel to it. What I mean by that, is that this Halo focused more on the gritty ambiance of war, and the characters around you that help you along the way accomplish your missions throughout the game. Those games did that, as you would follow a character along the way, develop relationships to a mild extent, and you could be drawn into the story. This Halo did that.\n\nAI is good at times and really bad at others. Your own folks sometimes will be great shots, and at other times allow themselves to be slaughtered in the open. Don't even think about letting them drive the vehicles for you.\n\nGraphics are great obviously.\n\nI found the controls to be very fine tuned as well. No issues here. That's saying something, because I'm a keyboard and mouse guy. However, there are games on these consoles that are worth playing regardless of how bad I or you may suck at these games with a controller. I found this game to be an easy quick learn with the controller, and I had very few issues mowing down the bad guys in this one.\n\nOverall, I really do recommend this game. You may want to wait until it comes down in price in the 30s to 40s area. For some reason this game just didn't have the epic feel of a Gears of War, or a Metal Gear Solid, or a Mass Effect, or another blockbuster game like those mentioned. Hence, the reason I wouldn't plop the 60 bones down for this one. However, it's still a great game to play if you're itching to see how the story began, or just have some fun in a sci-fi action shooter that is among the \"Very Goods\" in that department.", "summary": "Don't pass this one up", "unixReviewTime": 1286582400}

It featured a variety of classes, different spells, stats, secrets, and very little guidance.  One feature that tells you it's classic is that Armor Class (defense) actually gets better as it DECREASES and goes into the negatives.  The Dark Spire features all of this and more.\n\nTo start off, you choose four characters to make up your team.  You can decide their name, race (dwarves, elves, halflings, humans), class, spells (if they use magic), and alignment (lawful or chaotic).  Everything makes a difference in this game, however slight.\n\nNow you enter the Dark Spire itself to begin your adventure.  Navigation in this game is like old RPGs and Etrian Odyssey in that you are constantly walking through hallways from a first-person perspective, moving one square at a time.  You encounter random battles which range from one enemy to multiple groups of enemies.  The challenge level is pretty steep, requiring patience, lots of healing, and grinding.\n\nExperience points are used to upgrade your class level, skills, or stats.  Anything you raise costs a lot, so you need to be careful and think ahead before you spend your experience.\n\nThere's a variety of different equipment available in The Dark Spire--swords, helms, armor, shields, and accessories.  Weapons and armor can add special options to your attack and defend commands while in battle.  For example, a Longsword offers a precision attack for increased accuracy but takes longer to perform.  It also offers a lunge attack for doing extra damage at the expense of defense for that turn.  This adds lots of variety to each battle, and it makes equipment choice very important.\n\nOf course you can choose between classic and modern graphics in this game.  Classic is literally composed of straight white lines against a black background, except for character sprites which have a little color and detail.  It's as bare-bones as it can get.  Personally, I enjoy it and find myself playing in Classic mode periodically.  There's something about the retro feel that really interests me and adds some spark to the experience.\n\nThe music is odd, but enjoyable at the same time.  I really don't know how to describe it, so all I can say is that it ranges from mellow to upbeat.  The controls are great, but the menus (especially in the guild where you make and format your team, as well as spend experience points) can take a little bit getting used to.  I'm pretty comfortable with them now, but at first they had me lost.\n\nOverall, this game is amazing.  It's definitely not for everybody, though.  Those who like classic RPGs, enjoy difficult games, and liked Etrian Odyssey will probably like this game.  Otherwise, you might want to avoid it.  It's hard core Role-Playing, and its not taking any prisoners.", "summary": "Retro is good!", "unixReviewTime": 1240876800}

The game starts off with a ship called Pioneer 1 heading to a planet to migrate there because earth was no longer livable. Pioneer 1 had said that everything was A-OK so Pioneer 2 was sent off with the rest of earths population to go to Ragol (the name of this particular planet),But when P2 gets there they loose all contact with P1. This is where you come in,your character is tasked with investing the many areas of Ragol in search for survivors and any clue to as why the animals have suddenly gone aggressive. This is about the most story your going to get in one chunk with PSO the rest of it is told Via side quests and little text orbs in the main game.\n\nPSO was meant to be an online game and it shows, Pioneer 2 is pretty empty and the NPCs never say anything different unless your on a side quest. Normally when your online this is the place where other players are supposed to be,now since there is no conventional way of getting online (Yes you can still go onto PSO online,via private servers) all the areas will feel empty and you can blatantly tell that you were not supposed to be the only one doing some of the missions.\n\nThe graphics of PSO are very nice for a Dreamcast game,imagine a stepped down version of PSU and your not to far from the mark. Gameplay is pretty fun,if your a beginner on PSO then you might want to try your character out as a Ranger first,being a Hunter or force you first time will result in you not playing PSO very long. My only complaint is that you have to do an area over an over again to get the proper level to beat the boss/later floors,because as mentioned above,you were supposed to be in a group to beat the bosses at lower levels.\n\nPros:\n+Good amount of character customization\n+Good Graphics\n+Gameplay is fairly fun\n+Feeding you MAG is rewarding\n+Can still go online\n\nCons:\n-Was meant to be online,thus levels seem kind of empty\n-Have to go through levels multiple times to be strong enough to beat bosses\n-Game just feels overall empty offline.\n\nOverall I'd recommend this game if you like Phantasy Star games,but If you want a great offline experience with a story, go for PSU.", "summary": "My Review Of Phantasy Star Online", "unixReviewTime": 1260316800}

If you're a fan of Wolfenstein 3D or Return to Castle Wolfenstein, you'll LOVE this game.\n+ Gripping story. Greatly evolves as you progress in the game.\n+ Some very cool new twists in the story as well as the game play. Things like gravity and the Veil which is further explained in review.\n\nCons\n- Slightly dated graphics, level design, and game play\n- Online multiplayer can be a little dull. Mostly due to the level design and difficulty level.\n\nGraphics: 3 1/2 out of 5\nGame play: 3 out of 5\nStory: 5 out of 5\nSound: 4 1/2 out of 5\nOriginality: 3 out of 5\nMultiplayer: 2 out of 5\n\nI am a fan of classic Wolfenstein 3D and Return to Castle Wolfenstein. This game is fun. It reminds me so much of the classic games from years ago. For what else is out right now and how far games have come, to me, this game takes a step back. It is an old game, with better graphics and some slightly new ideas. Don't get me wrong, there are new little surprises and cool additions to the game play and storyline, but all in all, this is a basic game with a simple style and classic game play/menus/control.\n\nAfter playing Killzone 2, Infamous, Dead Space, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, and Resident Evil 5, Wolfenstein seems like a game which may have come out a few years ago, and been pretty good. With what else is out right now, and how far developers have pushed the limits of what can be done in a video game, this game does seem very dated.\n\nThe pros of this game are a pretty solid story and the little new twists in the atmosphere of the game. One new idea with the game play is the Veil. The Veil is a green blanket which covers the gaming world which you are in and transforms everything around you. It basically is a doorway between two worlds or detentions. You activate the Veil with a medallion you found. Let's say you are in the regular world walking around and come to a dead end. You activate the Veil and where there once was a wall, there now is a doorway. There is more to it as the game progresses and you can use it anytime and in more creative ways. You can collect four crystals to add to the medallion which give you different powers. Powers like the Veil, slowing down time, a shield, and intensifying your weapons. These powers drain your medallion which will then need to be recharged by standing over one of the little recharging portal peppered throughout the game. They are everywhere.\n\nOne simple yet really fun thing in the game is the anti-gravity tanks that are tossed in levels from time to time. If an enemy is near them, shot the tank and they'll go floating off. Much more fun to shoot.\n\nThis games mission design is set up a little differently. You can speak with people about mission and choose to do them in the order you wish. At times you may only have one mission. At others you may have 3 or so missions which you need to complete. And you can do them in any order you like. I wouldn't say it is a free roam game, but I think that is what they were going for.\n\nYou can upgrade all your weapons in the black market. Your medallion and Veil powers can also be upgraded. There are a lot of neat little supernatural weapons. The Particle Cannon for example is a weapon you collect from a big guy you must defeat. The Particle Cannon shoots this lightning like beam and completely disintegrates enemies.\n\nOver-all, this is a decent game, but it is very basic game play and has been done hundreds of times before. The Veil is very interesting and carries this otherwise dull game. Yes you can shoot bad guys heads off. Yes there are these Nazi zombie skeleton dudes. But the AI kinda sux. Very basic.\n\nI didn't hear too much about this games release and I took a chance and went out and bought it. Am I disappointed? Not to the extent where I would totally regret buying it. But I was expecting a little more. Better graphics and tighter game play. I find that the further I get into this game, the more I like it. It should keep me busy until Batman Arkham Asylum comes out next week.\n\nI hope this review helped those of you out there wanting a basic idea of how good Wolfenstein is.

A showcase collection to gather the first six Mega Man X games all on one disc, as well as the unreleased-in-America Mega Man Battle & Chase.\n\nThe reason for my review title stems from a grudge I had a long time ago. Most gamers from the 90s should remember a popular used game-selling company known as FuncoLand (now they are Gamestop). Well back in March of 1997, I saw listed in FuncoLand's catalog the fully priced MM:B&C. I was a very impatient kid back then who needed to have everything Mega Man, and so I quickly reserved a copy of the game before it was set to be released. I was really excited because it looked like it was going to be a pretty neat game, combining the classic Mega Man formula with racing. Unfortunately as it turned out, in a last minute action caused by Sony, Capcom was unable to release the game here in the US. So disappointed, then I demanded that FuncoLand return my money. They never did. I learned a hard lesson that day. And now, they finally decided to put the game on this Mega Man X collection, and having waited such a long time, I did not hesitate to unlock it. Unfortunately, I was majorly let down by what turned out to be a third-rate Mario Cart/Crash Team Racing clone that sucked for the most part. I can excuse the archaic graphics since I grew up with a PS1, but the game itself just seemed kinda... dull.\n\nOk, now that that's out of the way, onto the REAL reason to own this collection: the Mega Man X games! Yes, here Capcom decided to throw their first spin-off series to one of their top franchises, taking the first three games that originated on the SNES, and the second three that resided on the PS1, and left off X7 and X8 (due to the fact that those two games are widely available on the PS2, and so it would be pointless to include them).\n\nNow let's look at each X game!\n\n-Mega Man X\n\nINFO: Here's where the series starts off, introducing players to the story of the reploids, Zero, Sigma, the new anime-influenced look, a rocking soundtrack, robot-ride vehicles, heart-tanks, and the armor collecting feature that lets X do things like dash, head butt, and supercharge special weapons.\n\nMY THOUGHTS: Of all the X games, I find that this one and X4 have the most attention to detail in the little things. I'm talking about the features such as animations and things like taking out Chill Penguin's stage and causing another stage to freeze over. Very cool. It's an excellent place to start for beginners since the difficulty is not too terribly high. The levels are a bit sparse compared to the others (though not nearly as bad as in X4) but there are still plenty of secrets to collect, and being the first game, I can't fault it. The boss fights are fairly simple, but challenging enough for those who haven't played an X game before.\n\n-Mega Man X2\n\nINFO: The sequel brings forth a few new surprises such as the air dash, speeder vehicle, double charge shot, giga attack, and the ability to alter the ending based on defeating certain bosses throughout the game. It also featured a new graphics chip that enabled some interesting 3D wire frame effects to occur at various points.\n\nMY THOUGHTS: While the first X game was great, here is where the series really started to shine, IMO. There was a lot more that you could do; the levels were just large enough to really house some secrets, and just small enough to provide plenty of nonstop action. It's considered a favorite for many fans. Plus, of the classic X games, this one just has a great feel to it. My only gripe with the original SNES game comes from the IMMENSE SLOWDOWN, which was thankfully fixed in this collection. Bonus points go to that.\n\n-Mega Man X3\n\nINFO: The next entry featured the ability to call in for Zero's help and play as him briefly, a more complex super armor-collecting system, and the ability to call on special robot-ride armor vehicles at certain points of the stage.\n\nMY THOUGHTS: This one has always been my favorite, and to me was the series's definite high point. It's also the only game that I didn't have, considering how rare and expensive it was. As for the game, the difficulty is very high at this point and they give us a lot more stuff to do, such as find hidden stages and super armor pieces. No gripes here, other than the fact that they could have done more with the ability to play as Zero. But Capcom gave us a huge surprise here! They decided to take a game that was already great to begin with, and give the fans the previously \"import-only\" improved PS1/Saturn version that contains improved music, sound effects, and added anime cutscenes! How cool is that? If you buy this collection for JUST ONE REASON at all, get it for this nice bonus.\n\n-Mega Man X4\n\nINFO: The SNES was done, and Capcom decided to give the series a major cosmetic overhaul for the 32-bit generation, showing off with animation on par with the Street Fighter games. In addition, Zero could now be played completely for the first time, offering fans an alternate style of play to X's. Anime cutscenes run abundant here as well (though voice acted poorly).\n\nMY THOUGHTS: X4 quickly became a fan-favorite due to the anime cutscenes and excellent blend of action. This new look inspired the creators to pay attention to the cool little animation details once again, and give the game a nicely polished feel. In terms of this, the game succeeds beautifully. Plus, the soundtrack is probably the best a Mega Man game's music has ever been. However, I'll be the first here to point the game's vital fault that everyone always seems to overlook: the stage layouts are a huge letdown from X3's, putting us back to X1's simplistic approach. Keeping the action tight is good, but not at the expense of completely linear and short stages. Not only that, but there aren't nearly as many secrets to find this time around. Zero's quest is fun, though nothing is really different except for the story and the melee-oriented play style. The good thing though is that being on a Gamecube disc now, the loading times are NONEXISTENT! (this is true of both X5 and X6 also). I might sound a bit picky, but X4 really is a fun game that serves as another great place to start, though it's also the quickest of the six games to be done with. In its favor, I'd say that this one, along with X2, has perhaps the best feel and atmosphere to it, which sadly did not carry on to the next two games.\n\n-Mega Man X5\n\nINFO: introducing a new countdown timer that alters the game's ending, multiple armor sets to collect, and the ability to upgrade different aspects of the player's abilities. X and Zero can both now be switched back and forth at any time.\n\nMY THOUGHTS: It's typical of everyone to say that this is where the series started to go downhill and in many ways they are correct. However, X5 isn't as horrible of a game as people will get you to believe. For one, the stage layouts have improved immensely from the last game, and there are more secrets to collect once again like the 2 different armor suits. That's not to say that X5 doesn't have its faults. Quite the contrary: CAPCOM SHOULD HAVE RID OF THE MANDATORY INTERRUPTIONS THAT ALIA GIVES!! They had a chance to take off this major hindrance here and they blew it. If you're playing the games in order, this becomes especially annoying since all it does is provide \"vital\" hints such as \"Don't run into spikes!\" which do nothing but insult the player's intelligence after getting through X1-4. Also, X5 has ridiculously easy bosses, eliminating the need to \"find the right weapon\" when they can all be slaughtered rather easily by Zero's blade and the X-buster. And while the stages themselves are expansive enough, the designs seem a bit derived from X4's stages. These drawbacks make X5 my least favorite of the first six X games, but it's still a very worthwhile play if you can get past them.\n\n-Mega Man X6\n\nINFO: features a new \"nightmare\" system, a reploid-finding feature, the ability to wield Zero's saber with X, and a new control scheme for Zero.\n\nMY THOUGHTS: Wow. I must be the only fan that doesn't hate this game with a passion. While I agree that it's FAR from a classic compared to the others, it does have its moments of brilliance. I'd say the perfect description for X6 would be \"rough around the edges\". It has some ideas that are perfectly executed, and others that fail miserably. For instance, I love the reploid finding feature as it adds more depth to the stages, and the alternate exits are a nice touch. On the other hand, the nightmare system was a horrible attempt to bring back X1's stage altering elements, which could've worked with some more time and effort, but it falls completely flat and should've been left out. Also, forget the story, as after X5 it becomes just throwaway garbage. However, I'm REALLY GLAD they got rid of X5's terrible drawback here. It's a very difficult game that should probably be played last, since the nightmare elements add so much harm to the stages that it's nearly impossible to go unscathed. However, if you can last through the randomness of the nightmare system long enough, you'll be treated to two of the best armor suits in all of the X games. How much you will like this game depends primarily on how patient of a gamer you are.\n\nI was a bit worried at first about playing the games with the Gamecube's oddly distorted controller setup, but I quickly adjusted with no problems. Plus, you can switch the controls at anytime too, which is nice. There are some bonuses like early artwork for characters, secrets for each of the X games, and some of X3's remixed music. That's it though, so if you were expecting a cartoon like in the previous Mega Man collection, you'll be disappointed. I would've liked to seen some of the rejected ideas for bosses, that would be interesting for fans.\n\nOverall, this collection is for all the fans that grew up on these games, and also for those who started more recently and want to get acquainted with the series' roots. If you don't like Mega Man games, then this isn't going to change your mind. So just get equipped with Bubble Lead and check it out.

Of course if you are one who enjoys the cartoonist preception of the characters, this will be an okay feature. However, I recommend looking for screenshots of this game to see if you like the graphics.\n*Sim Theme Park clogs up your computer system much worse than Roller Coaster Tycoon, so unless you have a pretty fast system, be prepared for some freezing, where with Roller Coaster Tycoon you can pretty much play with out annoying slowness.\n*Sim Theme Park gets boring fast with its last of great rides, themes.\nDon't get me wrong I love simulation games.

Unfortunately, it isn't. The first annoying thing about it is the load times, or cut scenes, after you have seen your selected player be introduced and do a dance, you get very bored of it quickly, yet you can't just skip it and get back to the gameplay.\n\nYou get 1 mode at first called TV mode, then later on you can select the individual events you want to play I guess, I never bothered to play long enough to figure out how to unlock those. Whilst in gameplay, like the show, you must complete the obstacles just like on the show, so your first task is to use one of the buttons that make you either run, duck or jump while using the control pad to hold a direction. Had the developers taken to a control system like super Mario Bros then the game might have seemed like a bit of fun, but instead the controls are sloppy and you don't feel like you are in complete control of your character. Jumps don't seem to jump when you want them to, so your constantly having to pre-time things and figure to jump before you want to jump, or just try to speed through it and use the Force.\n\nSome of the obstacles I don't know what the game developers where thinking when they made them so short. For instance, on the show, you have that spinning roller platform thing where you have to balance while running across and also jump over two moving clock like arms... in this game, it is very much like that, however, it takes about 2 seconds to complete, before the next obstacle takes about 5 seconds to load and let you have control of your character again. The constant small waiting times add up, and you don't know when you get control back or not, a simple GO icon might have helped, but nope, you start running and fall into the water.\n\nAnd I must say the strategy of the game is hardly present. A few times you might know when to jump, but some things just have a mind of there own and there is no strategy other then either memorize what you previously did or just hope for the best, but there is no strategy to work out, it's just luck. The big balls can be easily crossed, and the punching wall is easy too, but everything else seems to have a mind of its own, but you'd think maybe the developers could come up with some way to make the game strategic and fun.\n\nThe commentary is annoying, as it's only a DS game it doesn't have a lot of capacity for many audio files, so expect to hear the exact same things every time you play. I just don't understand what game developers are thinking these days? What ever happened to strategy? Why is it a hand held console has the ability of the Super Nintendo and the Nintendo 64, yet developers can not take a look back in history to see how controls for a game should work? If they are going to make a game that does not require the stylus, then for god sakes, hire some programmers who know what they are doing when they design the controls and reaction time of these things and stop trying to make pretty pictures you can hardly interact with.", "summary": "The game wipes out", "unixReviewTime": 1288915200}

I hold the word with a dreamlike tone and utter, \"WOW.\"  With slobber and saliva dripping all over my gaming bib and onto my small GBA screen, I know gaming buffs around the world have rejoiced.  After the aged magic that was Super Mario RPG on the beloved SNES and Paper Mario on the N64, Nintendo resurrects the gaming legend once again.  Mario is known to travel in all types of gaming, from Mario Tennis to his true roots of platforming, but as far as his RPG entries are concerned, he never ceased to leave mouths hanging.  His third RPG graces the GBA and I couldn't be more happier since it proves to astound and innovate.  I find it, in every aspect, a rewarding treasure that is much needed in the overpopulated gaming stream.\nSometimes the gaming audience needs to take a refreshing break from hammering their wrath on the bad guy attempting to raze the world.  Sometimes gamers need to release tension whether it'd be a hectic job or schedule, and play a lightly driven, amusing game.  And that's where this great RPG glows.  Offering a screwball plotline, this RPG is a refreshing way to start packing up for another multi-hour adventure.  The vile emperor Cackletta has left Princess Peach as a destructive siren, and the notorious Bowser will not grab her until she is cured.  Bower decides to aid Mario and Luigi and treat her, and once that is done, Bowser will fulfill his only purpose in his existence, which is to kidnap the Princess.  So what if the plot is not nerve-busting, the sense of humor welcomingly emanates to fill such a void.  There are a plethora of jokes that mock the Mario franchise itself.  I cracked at the inability of the locales who knew nothing of Luigi, but only the heroics of Mario.  Unlike tons of RPGs, your journey will not be impeded by a mass of dialogue, and when there is some you'll be wanting to read and listen to it develop.\nThe gameplay is so solidly done that it is simply impossible to put the game down.  Many whine that the RPG genre has nothing new under the sun, but this game will make you more than eager to watch the RPG evolution, despite all the common transgressions.  The end results of the game is extraordinary, especially the hallmark gameplay.\nA hybrid of 2D Zelda on crack and traditional RPG battles, the game grinds both elements into an exquisite twist.  What makes it so different are the options bestowed before the player, both on the battle menu and while navigating dungeon play.  Battle menu aside, Mario and Luigi offers a unique gameplay experience that is extremely inventive.  Both brothers stay together, and each are able to be controlled.  They start off with simple actions, and as the player progresses through the game, both brothers develop abilities to use on  the environment.  Their moves vary, which in turn, access new areas in Beanbean Kingdom.  Each special move is hilarious in its own right, my favorite has to be Mario lighting Luigi's butt on fire, Luigi then rams his way through breakable things in the environment.  The creativity and hilarity booming in the game makes for an extremely hearty experience.\nThe battle engine is wonderfully done.  Borrowing the idea from Super Mario RPG, the GBA installment also has the player timing his button pressing.  If done successfully, the heroes will dodge and counterattack enemy attacks.  With the ordinary choices like item on the menu, the real innovation lies with the single and Bros. attack.  Single attacking allows the player to jump and use an assortment of strikes, while Bros give way to a collective combo.  While leveling up my team, I felt nostalgia encroach upon me.  It enkindled both the Super Mario universe and the incredible reality that Mario is in again, in terrific RPG format.  There are also other elements in the gameplay that make this RPG worth the time, such as the novel power of moustaches!\nThe atmosphere is velvety rich.  Closely matching the graphical nature of Yoshi's Island, another great game for the GBA, the screen is a fine lure into the Mario world.  The vibrant sprites of each character augment the gameplay and experience.  The cast of characters will summon back memories from past Mario games and not to mention new characters alike.  Animation is splendidly brimming with GBA quality all over it.  The environments which mirror all the regions that we've come to know on earth is layered exceedingly well on screen.  Helping to define the mood are the highly notable tunes.  Original nits and bits of classic sounds are back, remixed, and thrown with new catchy whiffs.  Its really surprising to listen to the variety of songs throughout the game.  As a double plus (newspeak), the cast uses their quirks and signature sounds.\nDo your gaming life a favor, remove yourself form the clich&eacute; of gaming titles and disappointments of this year, and get Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga.  Packing in appealing visuals, sound, and a variety of brilliant gameplay, an RPG hasn't felt this good for quite some time.  I'm particularly tired of graphical de force games that struggle to mirror Hollywood, especially the RPG genre.  It is a sure, safe bet to grab another game starring Mario, the one who probably started your gaming addiction altogether.", "summary": "Greatest GBA Game Yet", "unixReviewTime": 1070668800}

But i am pretty sure they will come through. But it was all a big headache and If you Get a PS TV Bundle Beware the memory card may be utter garbage.... Maybe Sony had only surplus memory laying around and threw them in the bundle to save money because this New 16gb is working like a charm....

SNK 1 and Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 seriously compromised the gameplay. So with the larger character roster and tweaked gameplay, what's not to like, right? Unfortunately, there are a couple of drawbacks. For some reason, Capcom has felt the need to leave the characters in their recent 2D fighting games in low resolution. I really don't see why they decided to do that, because even the animation intense Street Fighter 3 was done in high res. Also, some characters have been stretched and re-sized when they didn't need to be, and the fireballs are done with 3D graphics that do not match the 2D hand drawn characters. Even though the graphics and overall presentation are only satisfactory, I still recommend Capcom Vs. SNK 2.

Parsons", "reviewText": "I'm about 60% through it now with 35 hours (according to the game stats). Plays well, cars handle similar to Test Drive Unlimited.\n\nI have a few issues with the game:\n1) The recreation of Los Angeles is pretty weak. First of all they only included the basin and not the valley or even south bay. The boundaries are the 101, the PCH, the 5 and the 10. Why the hell did it take so long to get the game released if that's all they were going to include? The scope is incredibly weak compared to Test Drive Unlimited. Second of all, the parts of LA they DID include are barely true to life. They took quite a few liberties with the streets and layout. Very few of the actual stores/buildings look correct, and most of the streets aren't particularly similar to reality.\n\n2) The selection of cars in the game is limited -- again, why did this game take so long to get released? I've been waiting for it since they announced it about 18 months ago. There's maybe 40 cars, with many of those being \"DUB\" editions of the same cars.\n\n3) The game has some serious texture loading issues. Sometimes I'm driving around on a cloud because the ground textures don't load. Sometimes the wheels disappear off my car leaving tires with no rims.\n\n4) Somebody should've told Rockstar to listen to the old 80's song \"Nobody Walks in LA\" because they have an excessive amount of pedestrians walking the streets for no other reason then to distract your eyes with them dodging out of the way. And you can tell it's from the same people who made Grand Theft Auto since the character designs and voices are identical.\n\nWhat I like about the game:\n1) The controls are good. I don't have any issues with car handling or illusion of speed.

It is alot faster paced and has more smaller maps this year then previous entries. For those who complain about the jetpacks, they added a new mode where it is boots-on-the-ground only.

You are in a 80's theme park with four characters AJ, Andre, Poindexter and Sally. David Hasselhoff is also in the game, as a DJ who plays music from the 80's. The soundtrack is amazing, and definitely the best of the year. The map is a good size, but it is easy to navigate.

Others were so clever that only after you solved them could you figure out the clues that should have helped you.

It's not at the level of the original Myst's ending, but it's on the same path.  To my shame, I even had problems with the lack of direction in the game.  Essentially, at every stage, you have a mind-numbing number of alternative paths with no guidance on which you should do first.  I also had trouble keeping track of where I was, physically, in the worlds:  Tomahna and Spire were OK, but Haven (vague, twisty paths in look-alike jungle) and Serenia (nice paths, but twisty enough that even backtracking doesn't take you back where you thought you were) were impossible.\n\nI don't understand why the people who make these Myst games keep going astray.

Now I bought Underworld to finish the Tomb Raider story arc. I can't understand why the developers chose to use a new game engine when the previous games Legend and Anniversary used a great game engine. I will explain.\n\nThis game was released on multiple systems. PC, XBOX 360, PS3 etc. The PS2 was released months later. The game was a watered down version from the big three systems. The graphics are low resolution compared to the other versions. Also the game play is nowhere near as good as Legend. You get regenerating health and unlimited ammo for your guns. Plenty of grenades. But barely any enemies to shoot at! Bare environments. There are no boss battles at all! Mostly running, jumping, swimming, swinging, and climbing. The environments are bland. Nothing really stands out. Barely any life in the game. Easy puzzles to solve.\n\nThe game play and controls are riddled with bugs and glitches. You can get stuck in certain places and all you can do is reset the game. Worse than anything else is the camera. Unlike Legend, Underworld for the PS2 has the worse camera ever! Its difficult sometimes to tell how far you have to jump or climb a ledge. Why didn't the developers fix this problem is beyond me. Also the game has only one difficulty setting. You can beat the game in a day or less. Not much to unlock. Can't even unlock all the cut scenes. No character profiles.\n\nThe sound is the only thing I loved in Underworld. Once again the soundtrack is awesome! The music is very soothing and probably is the only thing redeeming about this game.\n\nThe cut scenes are low resolution. Only the beginning and ending has the high resolution scenes! Why couldn't they have added all the scenes in high resolutions?! Seriously?! Were the developers really that lazy to do even that?!\n\nAt least the game has the story intact. But it feels they could have done more to make the story and characters stand out. Lara Croft feels very bland and her emotions show in the game. Amanda Evert on the other hand was awesome. Her character stood out more than the hero. Yet in the end, the ending was really was disappointing. Doesn't matter what version you get. It felt the developers just rushed the game out without putting down the time and energy making a great story and much more a great game.\n\nI bought this game to finish the story between Lara Croft and Amanda Evert, finding her mother and saving the world. I wish they had done a better job with the PS2 game. The game wasn't a big hit on any console. It had moderate success. If you have the money, but the Tomb Raider Trilogy on PS3.

Bakehorn", "reviewText": "Grand Theft Auto, like it or not, should be credited as one of the most important video games in the last decade. It created a genre, reinvented several others, and for better and worse put video games out in front of a bigger audience than ever before. Not the first developer to attempt to imitate this formula, the Champaign, Illinois-based Volition has created Saint's Row, another game with high hopes of giving Rockstar's bad-mouthed baby a run for its money. It does this better than any game before it and ends up as one of the best titles on the Xbox 360.\n\nSo many sandbox games have been done before and one might wonder just what Saint's Row does to be unique. What's new here that wasn't in Grand Theft Auto, True Crime, Driver or The Godfather? Well, fundamentally, nothing. You've driven cars, done drive-bys, taken out gangs, run over pedestrians, and rode shotgun-why do it all again in a $60 Xbox 360 game? Well, despite the fact that Saint's Row takes you down several familiar roads, it does everything Grand Theft Auto and its imitators did, but a lot better.\n\nSaint's Row throws you into a city called Stilwater. In the wrong place at the wrong time, you're the sole survivor of a brutal gang scuffle. You're rescued by Julius, the leader of the Saints, a lesser-known gang in Stilwater. With nothing else to do, you embark on a bloody journey with the Saints to claim Stilwater as their own. It's an all-out territory war between the business-savvy Vice Kings, the gearhead Westside Rollerz, and the drug-dealing Carnales.\n\nSaint's Row has a story that's worth listening to. The different lieutenants of the Saints are all colorful characters indeed, and their enemies for each gang are equally interesting. The story isn't an all-out win for anyone, with tragic losses, betrayals, and more for each warring faction. An interesting choice was to keep the main character silent except for a few interesting times throughout the violent campaign-and when the man finally talks, it's always something that'll catch you off-guard. I especially enjoyed his quip during the final Vice Kings mission.\n\nBefore I get to the open-world things you can find in Saint's Row, I'll explain the mission structure. Unlike other games, where completing story-based missions allows you to continue onto more missions, Saint's Row forces you to earn respect points. These points are a reward earned by \"spreading the word\" and causing havoc throughout Stilwater in the name of the Saints. This is done by taking part in various Activities, like playing the pimp in \"Snatch,\" the chauffeur in \"Escort,\" shooting everything in sight in \"Mayhem,\" or slowly taking out targets in \"Hitman.\" Once enough respect points are earned, the player can continue through the story. Not only does this system nudge the player to explore Stilwater and play the game at a less-focused, slower pace, it allows the player to see all of the different gameplay concepts found in the game.\n\nAs I mentioned, Saint's Row is a story about a territory war, so a large percentage of your time will be devoted to earning 36 different sectors in Stilwater and defending them from the three opposing gangs. These territories are unlocked naturally throughout each gang's storyline, so you'll take over the west side of Stilwater before you're done with the Rollerz, win the south while fighting the Carnales, and raise your flags in the downtown area during your conquest against the Vice Kings. After winning territories, you'll occasionally have to defend them against the old owners. This is done in a way that seems random, so sometimes you'll be cruising along and receive an in-game message that your territory is being attacked. It's not mandatory to fight back for the territory, but it helps greatly when you have to drive through that territory and you don't have to worry about being shot at.\n\nOn top of the game's 36 story-based missions and the 36 territories, there are Stronghold missions that also help in the territory take-over. When you've earned additional respect points, you'll sometimes be able to take over an enemy Stronghold. Stronghold missions, alongside the Activities, are my favorite part of Saint's Row. These are generally all-out assaults on an enemy base that is filled to the brim with angry defenders armed with bigger guns. There are some Stronghold missions that play things differently. For example, while taking over one Carnales Stronghold, you'll do a little demolition by planting bombs throughout a factory. Sadly, Stronghold missions don't come around as often as I'd have hoped-I would have loved to see a Stronghold in every single sector of the city.\n\nI can't go much longer without crediting Volition for giving Saint's Row a typical first-person shooter control scheme. Unlike the abysmal \"lock-on and shoot\" style of Grand Theft Auto, Saint's Row plays very smoothly in every way. Running around and aiming your weapons are both controlled by the analog sticks, and there isn't even a lock-on button to be found. If you're a fan of first-person shooters (if you've got an Xbox 360, you probably are), you'll feel right at home with this style. Fortunately, shooting isn't the only thing that's really easy to do. The cars in Saint's Row all feel very stable and controllable, which I strongly prefer to the buck-wild vehicles found in Grand Theft Auto. It doesn't matter if you're driving an old beater, a high-end sports car, or a delivery truck, the controls never become a frustrating issue. That's more than Grand Theft Auto could ever claim.\n\nThere are some gameplay touches that fans of this genre should be very happy with. Volition made this a peoples' game by toning down the backtracking and retracing of the steps-if you're taken out in a mission, you have the option to restart the mission from its beginning with everything you had prior to the mission. This is a simple and small touch, but it's one that I'm personally very fond of when I think back to Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and I remember driving for several combined hours to retry missions at their starting point. Also, throughout the game, there are a ton of save points. Capturing an enemy stronghold or crib will spawn another save point location, so by the end of the game, there will be more than two dozen save points across the city. Add the ability to save anywhere on the fly, and you've got a very easily accessible game.\n\nSaint's Row runs on all four cylinders in terms of presentation. The visuals are fantastic, spare for a few genre-familiar problems (pop-up, bad draw distance, etc.). The overall look of the game is very bright and colorful, giving a rather comical appearance to a very brutal game. There are so many little touches that make this game look smooth. For example, your characters will hop into the seats of a convertible rather than open the doors to slowly get in. The particle effects and physics engine are definitely the highlights, though. After blowing up cars, you're treated to some of the best explosions ever seen in video games. Don't gawk too long, though, because the debris will eventually come crashing down, crush your body, and then burn it to a crisp if you manage to survive!\n\nThe sound is fantastic in every way. The radio stations don't rival those of Grand Theft Auto but they're still entertaining. The sound effects are great as well. But what has to be credited the most is the dialogue. Saint's Row features the most ridiculous but excellent dialogue I've seen from a game like this. There are a few too many f- and n-bombs for my taste, but in the actual story scenes, the dialogue is believable and well-done. Some of the other dialogue is so raunchy that you'll definitely want to keep any kids away. During some of the Escort Activity missions, I heard the most perverse sexual things I think I've ever heard in my life. Still, this is a game you'll want to listen to-keep that Xbox 360 Soundtrack turned off!\n\nThe raunchy dialogue is accompanied by a generally sick sense of humor that mimics that of Rockstar very well. Volition pokes fun at several different things in this game, and you'll catch a lot of them in no time. For example, a common one is the \"grown-up, mature\" version of the late Dave Thomas's Midwest-based food chain, Wendy's. The commercials heard in the game are pretty ridiculous. Friendly Fire, Stilwater's firearm store, is a complete rip-off of Ammu-Nation, Grand Theft Auto's equivalent. The commercials make this especially noticeable.\n\nSaint's Row's online gameplay is something that has never been attempted before in the sandbox genre. Online, you can choose from several gameplay modes. The online gameplay modes are all a lot of fun when the connection isn't awful, but in my experience, the connection was almost always awful, so I didn't have the most fun on Xbox Live with this game. There was severe lag, a ton of disconnecting, and a lot of quitters. Also, I felt like the characters died and ran out of stamina far too quickly. Rather than being a fast-paced game where players were free to run around, the lack of stamina made everything a much slower affair. Still, there's a lot of potential whenever the servers are more stable. The Gang setup (basically the exact same concept as Halo 2's clans) is great, and the lobbies are fun, letting you cap and chat with your buddies while waiting on the game to load.\n\nOverall, Saint's Row isn't without its problems-frustrating missions, choppy online play, and a few graphical glitches show that Saint's Row is human. Add those to the familiar ground tread in the game's storyline, and the lack of some of GTA's newer features, and you've got a game that is a few years behind the competition. But does that mean that Saint's Row is bad? No! Far from it! Saint's Row is a fantastic game that had me glued to my seat. I was so glued, in fact, that I played it for more than ten hours after putting it into my Xbox 360 for the first time, completing more than 30% of the game in a single sitting. Then the next day came and went. And the next day. And the next day. Saint's Row's got the great graphics, excellent presentation, control style, online gameplay, and entertainment value to make it more than worthy of your $60.", "summary": "The Saints come marching onto Xbox 360", "unixReviewTime": 1157500800}

Often he will forget how to climb up well being shot at, or suddenly bolt right or left when you've been continually leaping forward. He'll even ignore clear, life saving, leaps to just plummet off cliffs like a drunk lemming. It's like the AI is having a panic attack!

I think the reason so many reviewers say the game could do without the whole \"Assassin\" thing is simply because the movement can be so spotty.

I don't really enjoy teaming up with other people online very often, and especially not in game like this. I love a good story, one that is long and involving and a game that feels challenging and satisfying.\n\nResident Evil 4 was all that for me. That was the first RE game I ever played, and it was one of the best gaming experiences of my life. So, I was beyond excited for this one, especially when it looked like it was going to be the same gameplay as RE4 but with better, HD graphics. And set in Africa? Sounds cool.\n\nThe first disappointment was realizing this was going to be an entirely co-op game. Ugh. Incredibly annoying decision for gamers like me. But, I bought the game anyway, and actually, even the AI-Sheva is far from being the most disappointing aspect of this game.\n\nIt's all been said before, but it's all true. There are so few scares here ... this is all action, AND, it's INCREDIBLY easy. It's SO DIFFICULT to die in this game. When you're near death, Sheva will revive you enough to keep going, and then you will usually find first aid spray or a green herb in the next box you destroy. In RE4, the boss battles were epic and incredibly well thought out. In RE5, they are horrific. Again, easy, predictable, nothing more than great eye candy. The challenge in this game is nearly non-existent.\n\nThe voice acting is very good, however, and yeah, the graphics are astounding, but you know what? I was so disappointed in this game that I went out and bought a Gamecube and the Resident Evil 1 remake, and I am enjoying that game FAAARRR more than RE5. It's smarter, it's harder, it's MUCH, MUCH SCARIER, and it's far more satisfying. And, the puzzles require a little bit of thought.\n\nRE5 is a tremendous disappointment. It's yet another dumbed-down sequel to a once-great franchise. Has society really gotten this stupid? Has the gaming community really become so unintelligent that they can't deal with a game of the magnitude of RE 1 anymore, that they have to have games where they can no longer even die unless they really, really try hard to? This is simply not fun at all.\n\nI truly wish someone would remake all the old RE games for next-gen systems.

MMO aspect aside, it was one of the most beautiful game worlds ever conceived. The art direction was awe-inspiring, and the combat was very good. I was invested in the warcraft lore and so actually being able to run in a building was pretty amazing to me. Thunder Bluff, the Undercity, Stormwind, Tendrassill have some of the best architectures ever seen, in real life or in virtual life.\n\nI played through burning legion then took a break. But when I came back for trials, I'd still play ravishingly, burning through the new content as fast as I could while the trial lasted. The last time I did this was with the Cataclysm scroll of resurrection.\n\nI just played the trial. I played a hours of it, completed a few quests.\n\nThen got bored. It was a chore to complete. I stopped at the first pandaria 85 zone.\n\nThe magic is gone.\n\nWOW has really changed over the years. Where it had once been bustling with life, now it is largely empty. I remember when it was so full that completing newbie quests could be hard because there was always someone killing the newbie stuff. Now, I go to 85 Horde Pandaria area like one month after launch and it is *empty*. It's like the people who still are playing the game max out the level within a week of release and then go raiding.\n\nWorld PVP used to be real. Starting around level 25, Alliance and Horde were channeled to the same zones and so while completing a quest you might see an opposite faction player and decide to gank him, or he gank you. That added a sense of chaotic spontaneity and I loved it.\n\nNow, you largely quest alone and there's no one to challenge you. Or, a high level griefer will drop by, kill you, and then fly off with a flying mount.\n\nAll of this is I believe a natural result of MMO's developing expansions which spread out the player base, as well as the game just getting old.\n\nMy biggest problem with WOW as it is right now though are the numbers. My druid has something like 16 million health. I remember when he was like level 15 and had 112 HP. I prefer having HP and damage be in the low 3 digits and the high 2 digits. That makes it easy to keep track of stuff. Now, stats are in the hundreds of thousands which makes them meaningless. I do not notice out how a piece that improves my agi from 293 to 333 makes things better, because the damage goes from like 30,203 to 31,212.\n\nIn RPG's, it's really cool getting a new sword that lets you increase your damage from just 8 to 9. But from 68382 to 72384?\n\nAlso, WOW as it has aged has only streamlined more and shed its RPG lineage. Shamans and Paladins are had on each faction. Yeah, balance, but still it takes away contrast. Druids used to go on this epic two-continent quest to get water travel form. The quests were tied in with the lore, because the people in charge were story-tellers first, power-levelers last.\n\nNow, the power-levelers have taken over. You train water form at the trainer. Exciting, I know.\n\nAlso, complexity has increased exponentially, and customizability has gone down. With my druid there are like three charge skills, 5 \"oh shit\" skills, 5 finishing moves, 4 bleed moves, at any times there will be like 15 -20 skills to hit. But the other classes got skills too. So basically it's just all overwhelming and it all evens out anyways so you're frantically hitting buttons with no real idea how it will affect the underlying statistics.\n\nThere used to be 31 point talents. You could jigger out new builds using talent calculators.\n\nNow, you pick from three abilities at certain tiers.\n\nThe game is more a beat-em-up game now than it is an RPG. A shame. I actually stopped playing 3 days into the trial and couldn't get myself to go back in the game. A first for me, and a last.", "summary": "The magic is spent", "unixReviewTime": 1353283200}

While the story is simple and shallow the game play is where it's at. You can play as a warrior knight who has a sword and shield and is your combat guy, the thief has a grappling hook for getting across long distances and a bow for long distance kills, and the wizard can create objects to climb on and levitate objects but it a no-go during combat.\n\nThe wizard is the most interesting character since he can create blocks to climb on and bridges to cross gaps. You can find things to add to your characters to give them new abililities as well as enhance them. The combat is pretty shallow as well with just a hack and slash everything that comes after you type play. It actually tends to get in the way of the tricky platforming and can get annoying after awhile.

There are a few glitches in the game, but these are all wonky physics issues. The game is pretty much just get from left to right without dying, but you can respawn characters at checkpoints so dying seems kind of pointless since you aren't severly punished.

Unfortunately, Resident Evil 5 lacks almost everything that made RE4 a good game in the  first place: interesting characters, a lot of well done boss battles, decent plot, and most of all, moments that are actually scary. Not once was I scared when playing Resident Evil 5. Not once. And this is supposed to be a horror game? It's about as scary as L4D, which isn't scary in the least. There wasn't a single thing in RE5 that surpassed its predecessor, aside from graphics and the fact that it has CoOp. Resident Evil 5 was just a really bland game.\n\nThen there's the fact that RE5 is consolized. Sure, you can see more enemies on the screen on the PC version, but aside from that, what is there? Aside from that, there's the abomination Games for Windows Live that you have to install to play the game. Sure, it lets you make an offline account, but that doesn't stop it from being a pain. Thankfully, at least the PC version has mouse support. It strikes me as odd that mouse support is something that PC gamers look for in games these days.\n\nThe only really good thing about RE5 is the fact that it has CoOp. I can see why the developers included it, because without it, it would be absolutely horrible. Although I did have a ton of fun playing CoOp, it got old after a while. Not even CoOp can fix the bland, dull environments or the lack of any real horror elements. Resident Evil 5 seems really rushed compared to RE4.

I decided to buy an Xbox One and this was one of the games I bought when I purchased the Xbox One. I've been playing wrestling games since Pro Wrestling on the NES and spent way too many hours playing couch co-op wrestling games on the N64. But I'm writing this review mainly to explain why I just traded it back in to Amazon while the trade-in price is still enough to buy a different game.\n\nThe most obvious thing I noticed was the graphics aren't that much better than WWE 2K15 on the 360. They are better, but it's not a very big difference, I would say some of the character models look worse even, especially in the faces. I didn't play WWE 2K15 on the Xbox One, but had read all the negative reviews. It almost makes me wonder if 2K knew they could get by with an improved version of 2K15 on current generations then just stopped there.\n\nPeople say we have to get used to the use of season pass/DLCs, but I don't. I'm a fashionably late gamer. Recently turned 40. And that's my other reason for trading it in, I'll just wait for the price to drop then buy it again and the season pass. It's similar to how I did both of the previous years.\n\nThe problem with WWE 2K16's entire setup is it is constantly looking to make more money. You want that 120 wrestler roster? It's there, but you have to unlock it. You can play through the rough/boring modes to unlock the wrestlers or you can buy the accelerator or better yet, buy the season pass which comes with the accelerator. I had also seen where Samoa Joe is going to be in this one and wanted to use him. He's not here yet. Buy the season pass, he'll be in the DLC released over the next 6 months. Want some of the more unique moves to use with your created wrestler? Buy the DLC, there's a moves pack coming in the future.\n\nThe create-a-wrestler feature isn't anywhere near the level of the 360 versions of past years, but that goes back to me saying you have to wonder if 2K's goal was to just make 2K16 on current gen better than 2K15 was on current gen. There's no way to morph the face of your created wrestler. You'll pick a preset (roughly 20 available) then try to change the facial features enough that it won't look like a wrestler already in the game. I realized after my sixth match with my created wrestler that I had used Cody Rhodes face. They did put a \"deformation\" option in the facial creation, but who wants a wrestler with one eye on his cheek, the other on his forehead? You can't alter the neck size, hand size or feet size. I would say, if estimating, 50% of the original creation suite in last generation is in this next gen version. Just get around the face problems by putting a mask on your created wrestler.\n\nThere's a serious AI problem. I was wrestling Sheamus with my created wrestler. Hit him with a signature and 3 stored finishers. He kicked out. Worked my way back to 3 stored finishers, hit him with the signature and 3 finishers again. He kicked out. He's bleeding to the max level, has all red body parts. He had pulled off maybe 5 moves over the whole match. He gets up from my second triple finisher, hits the Celtic Cross (no idea how he had a finisher), pins me and wins. By the way, my created wrestler was 100 rated.\n\nI let my 11 year old son play it to see if maybe I was doing something wrong. He lost a match after being punched because he couldn't kick out with the new kick out mini-game. I'm guessing you could go online and win a lot of matches that way. The game doesn't differentiate from a wrestler who has been beaten for 10 minutes straight from a wrestler who has taken one punch. The pin mini-game does make your kick out area bigger if you're fresher, but it won't say, \"Wait, he's only been punched once, a pin here is not realistic whether the player clicks kick out in the right area or not\". You will lose.\n\nThe new submission controls are just as bad about this. I had a submission on an opponent, was able to keep my bar within his bar for nearly the entire move, but he still escaped. He puts a submission on me. I'm avoiding his bar the whole time. He gets his bar within mine for 1-2 seconds, my guy gives up.\n\nHere's the bad part, I like these new mini-games for pins and submissions, but they're still horribly unbalanced.\n\nThe biggest fault of the game is one I had noticed, but wasn't for sure what it was. The moves have very little impact. The ring reacts to moves as if it were concrete. Then there's the crowd. I did a top-rope brainbuster, a huge, legendary move from Japan, the crowd barely reacts. I run over and kick my downed opponent, the crowd erupts. This makes the matches feel even more boring than they are.\n\nThere's 2K's insistence to have motion-captured moves. It's not a big deal unless you go to make a created wrestler and realize a lot of the moves look like the wrestler is doing them who the move is tied to. For example, do a Rock Bottom with your created wrestler, he takes on the mannerisms of The Rock. Do a handspring elbow into the corner and your male wrestler becomes a Diva in mannerisms because they only motion-captured a female wrestler doing the move. In their effort to make the moves as realistic as possible they've in turn made those moves unrealistic to use for your original created wrestler. This problem has been around in all of the 2K wrestling games I've played, but it's getting worse by the year.\n\nThe whole effort comes off as lazy. My thinking is they should consider releasing this game every other year instead of trying to release a new one every holiday season. To make matters worse, they will be releasing DLC for the next 6 months. So it's either already done and they just held out to make more money or they're going to be working on the DLC when they should be working on next year's version. There's a problem when you end up making your created wrestler with the late Umaga's Samoan Spike as your signature move and Haku/Meng's Tongan Death Grip as your finisher, just because you like the combination of damaging the throat, not because it's a move you've never used in a wrestling game.\n\nBut with all these complaints, I'm positive I'll eventually buy it again, but its price will be low enough that when combined with the season pass, it will be less than the initial price. I'm being generous on 3 stars. That's more or less what I think the game will be once all the DLC is out.", "summary": "Being fair and disappointed", "unixReviewTime": 1448409600}

You know, the ones where you sit in the same place for an hour twisting knobs and flipping switches until the door finally opens, or moving the chess pieces into just the right configuration so that you can get to the next level.\nWhich was why I was a little hesitant to buy Ico. Still, the graphics looked amazing, and I found it used, so I gambled and came home with the finest puzzle game I've ever played.\nWhat's different about this puzzle game? A number of things. First, the puzzles make sense. You play Ico, a small boy locked into a deserted castle who comes upon a princess in much the same situation. The object is to get both of you out of the castle. In order to get through a level, you have to get Ico and the princess through the energy door on each level. In order to get through the energy door (which only the princess can open), you have only to get the princess there. Knowing that she can't make the amazing jumps or climb chains like Ico can, solving each level's puzzle is simply a matter of making that level accessible to the princess. This done by lowering drawbridges, pushing boxes, raising stairs, etc. so that the princess can get through the door.\nSecond, you're not tied to a single spot until you solve the puzzle. The levels in Ico are really big, and you'll need to move thorughout them in order to pave a path for the princess. Just make sure you don't stray from her too long or the mysterious shadows will come carry her away.\nThird, there are no items you need to carry around the whole game, looking for the right place to use them. The levels are self-contained, and everything you need to solve the puzzle is right there on that level. In fact, Ico doesn't even have an inventory system.\nFouth, you can't get in so much trouble on a level that you've got to start over; you're free to experiment without fear. The only two things that make you restart the level are Ico falling too great a distance, or the princess being carried away by evil shadows.\nAs I mentioned at the beginning, the game is gorgeous. The castle has so many varied textures and architectures that every level is a joy to behold.  The characters move realistically, and there's a great eye to detail. Whenever Ico jumps there's a little puff of dust that blows up, the sound Ico makes changes depending on the accoustics of the room he's in, the princess reacts to Ico's actions with amazing accuracy. This attention to detail made for an extremely immersive experience.\nFinally, the story. There's not much of one - get Ico and the princess out of the castle while avoiding inky shadow creatures and the evil queen. The last hour of the story, however, is really good.\nGet the game and play it. Whatever you do, though, don't leave until after the final credits have rolled!", "summary": "Finally, a puzzle game I enjoyed!", "unixReviewTime": 1012089600}

However, both of these flaws would have been completely excusable if the story hadn't sucked SO BAD.  Sure, the plot line in Sonic Adventure 2 was corny, but at least it had a beginning, a middle and an end.  Plus- it related to the levels.  There is a level in Sonic Heroes where you go to a haunted house and it is kind of fun but, what in the world does it have to do with anything?  And MAN!  Shadow... they didn't even explain how he some how came back from the dead.

Mine are usually shot down in the first minute.\nMy biggest complaint - as you progress in the game, you'll find the missions become harder not because the enemy AI becomes smarter, but because the missions become longer and you find yourself fighting wave after wave of enemy planes.  Kind of like the shooter games where you find yourself alone in a room surrounded by 100 monsters.  Gets tedious.

Bateman", "reviewText": "Combining racing and stunts, Pure is a frantic action racing game.  As with many other racing games, you compete through a series of racing cups, with many different types of tracks, most set in outdoor areas such as tropical or desert.  The graphics are very nice, sound as well.  The music is the typical mostly unremarkable rock with a few recognizable songs, but most I wasn't familiar with.\n\nThis is not a pure racing game and it doesn't allow more than one player to play on one console.  So if you were wanting Burnout on a 4-wheeler, this isn't it.  With all the tricks, it's more like the old SSX games minus the split-screen action.\n\nAs you race around the track, to get \"boost\" and be able to go faster, you need to perform tricks.  Performing a trick requires a somewhat complicated \"pre-load\" move which involves flicking the analog stick down and then up at the edge of a jump, preferably assisted by boost to give you extra speed.  It sounds a little complicated but isn't too terribly hard once you get used to it.  It does require a bit of button dexterity to do well though.  There are different tiers of tricks, you can only do the basics at first but as you successfully pull off more tricks you get more boost and can perform more tricks.  With full boost you get to do special tricks, but they require a looong jump to have time to pull them off.  So there's quite a bit of strategy as to when to do the special tricks.  More tricks = more boost and if you max out your boost and keep performing special tricks, you'll stay at max boost.  But that isn't possible on most tracks, there aren't enough big jumps to get you jumping high and long enough for special tricks over and over.\n\nSuccessfully performing tricks and getting the resulting boost reservoir is almost required to win races.  This takes Pure away from being a pure racing game and makes it more of a stunt/racing game.  Not sure how I feel about that, it takes a bit of the mindless fun away from it.  It does add strategy though.\n\nYou can customize several different 4-wheelers to use during the races, more slots become available as you proceed through the game.  You'll get things like hand grips, handlebars, frames, bodys, sprockets, engines, shocks, etc.  Choosing parts is a bit cumbersome to me, a particular set of handlebars may increase tricks score by 2 and decrease handling by 1.  You have 5 or 6 stats to keep up with and many parts are just a tradeoff of two stats, rather than an overall improvement.  Plus when you have 4 or 5 different parts to choose from it becomes a memorization exercise as well, which part gave the best overall values or tradeoff?  And if you get first place in a race you may win several new parts.\n\nThere is no custom character creator if that matters.  You can choose from several male and female characters.\n\nOverall I like Pure quite a bit.  I'm taking off one star because of no split screen multiplayer.  Really, that's one of the HUGE advantages console gaming has had in the past, it should be a social experience where you can invite friends over to play.  The other star is removed because I think overall the tricks are a bit cumbersome.", "summary": "Fun stunt/racing game", "unixReviewTime": 1226534400}

Jeanclerc", "reviewText": "There's no disputing that EA owns the lion's share of the sports videogame market, especially with last year's acquisition of exclusive licenses for both pro and college football. Many (understandably) feared that this lack of competition would lead to lackluster games, i.e. each year's release being reduced to not much more than a full-price roster update. A lot of people also figure that the NCAA series is probably just warmed-over Madden clothed in a different set of uniforms.  Nothing could be further from the truth - in fact, it's the Madden franchise that suddenly has some catching up to do.  So if you're looking to get your first college football game, look no further.  However, perrenial fans of the series will quickly find that the 07 version of NCAA bears too much similarity to last year's superb game, leaving questions as to whether or not it's worth the price.\n\nGAME MODES\n\nAll of the familiar game modes are here, such as single game and a great multi-season dynasty mode (more on that later).  Last year's Race for the Heisman, where you take an individual through his college career, ultimately turned out to be a fresh idea that was lacking in the execution.  In NCAA 07, it has been reintroduced as \"Campus Legend\" mode, but the improvements don't make enough of a difference.  The goal this time is expanded beyond simply chasing the Heisman - now you're out to become an all-time great by balancing performance on the field, strong academics, and popularity on campus.  Academics begin when you choose a major during player creation.  There are three levels of difficulty, with the easiest covering sports topics like team mascots and sports trivia and the most difficult covering real chemistry, U. S. history, etc.  Then, during the season you take a mid-term and a final exam to determine your grades.  If you do well, you earn ability bonus points.  Different majors affect different abilities and the harder the major, the more you can potentially gain.  On the other hand, if you blow your exams, you could be declared academically ineligible or even booted off of the team.  I tried the U.S. History major and found most of the questions to be a mix of everyday knowledge, although there were some topics that I genuinely had to guess.  But don't worry - you've got opportunity to study each evening during the season to get some tip-offs about the questions that will be on the exam.  Of course, if you sit in your room and study all the time, you're blowing your chance to become a true big man on campus.  You've got to throw some nights out on the town into the mix or else your popularity rating will suffer.  Beating a rival school or turning in a record-breaking performance will also help out, just as sins against the alma mater such as declaring early for the draft will cause your stock to plummet.  You've got to keep an eye on all three factors in order to attain the \"Campus Legend\" status when you graduate.  But ultimately, these additions just mean more button-pressing (and sooner rather than later, probably just simming) - there's not much feedback or visuals associated with whatever you choose to do with your time.  EA needs to continue to improve on this mode or else just scrap it.\n\nSo once again, the best way to play NCAA is dynasty mode, where you control a school's program year-round. During the season, you get a great mix of responsibilities: you're the Athletic Director looking to avoid NCAA sanctions by disciplining problem players, you're the coach sorting out the depth chart while also courting high school recruits, and of course you're the players strapping on the pads each Saturday.  In-season recruiting is one of the best additions to this year's game - it works basically like a poker game where you bet your finite time on how much attention each recruit needs and what kind of pitch will attract him to your school. If you leave it to one of your assistants to call him about the school's prestige, don't be surprise to watch him commit to your rival whose entire coaching staff showed up at his front door promising an immediate starting role. You also schedule recruit visits to your school, which can go a long way toward securing the signing if you beat up on your on-field opponent that week. There aren't any unsavory aspects of the NCAA represented here, i.e. you can't buy a recruit a car and so that he'll immediately sign. In fact, it's quite the opposite - if your team is under any NCAA scrutiny for rule violations or disciplinary problems, you'll find it much harder to attract blue chippers, so don't slack on your AD responsibilities when your superstar decides to stop going to classes. As the season winds down, you'll get your committments and start playing for the bowl rankings and player trophies.\n\nOK, so your dynasty school just ran over the competition in their bowl game. Mission accomplished, right? As Lee Corso would say (and does say quite a bit in the game) \"Uh-uh. I don't think so, Sweetheart.\" You've got to look at who's graduating, who's going pro, who you might be able to talk into staying (furthering the integration with Madden, you can even export that entire NCAA class to become the draft class for Madden's franchise mode). After that period is over, you hit the recruiting trail. The off-season recruiting works much like the in-season session but with even more detail. For instance, over the course of the several years, you can set up specific states as pipelines where the many of the top candidates will already be interested in your school on day one. Still, it's up to you as coach to figure out the right buttons to press to get the commit. Recruiting continues week by week for five weeks; however, if you're not into this much detail, you can opt to automatically have the computer do its best for you. This 07 version of NCAA also adds the spring game to the year-round schedule, which is useful both as an evaluation for who you should reshirt and also an additional way to increase select players' attribute points through reps.  Afterward, you check on your players' off-season skills progression, set the depth charts, redshirt players and then you're ready to suit up for the next upcoming season. You can also change up the team's non-conference games in order to bolster your strength of schedule or generate a new rivalry.\n\nIf you build up your school's program over the course of several seasons, you may receive an invitation to join a better conference and play in front of better crowds, all of which will attract better recruits. Of course, your head coach may also opt to take a higher-profile job elsewhere, so success is a dual-edged sword.\n\nRecent versions of NCAA have also solved one of my biggest pet peaves with the older generation of NCAA sports games - you can just substitute made-up names for the players instead of going with QB#7 handing off to HB#23. I understand why legally you can't use these players' real names, but I never understood why you couldn't just go with any name instead of position and number. Of course we all know who that stellar Texas signalcaller or USC ultra-back is, so made-up names work just fine. If it really bothers you, you can take the time to edit them.\n\nThe main menu also features options to quickly set up one-time games, including all of the major rivalries, and even a goofy game played between mascots.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nIn-game control remains another highlight of NCAA 07 - you can perform a lot of cool moves with relatively simple and sensible button/stick combinations. Chief among these is the use of the right analog stick to perform juke moves on offense and big hits on defense. Earlier EA games turned the right stick into a Superman button where your player would defy the laws of physics as a reward for you merely touching the stick. Thankfully, this has been reeled back to more realistic limits while still keeping the excitement factor. You even have the option to zoom in and slow-mo particularly well-executed moves. You can't help but get hyped up when you look to be caught in the backfield by the other guy's blitzing backer only to spin, stiff arm him to the turf and then hurdle over him on your way to six. There is even an optional camera mode in this year's game that will zoom in and show you your fancy moves in slo-motion as they happen.  Of course, some will see this as disruptive to the flow of the game - there is an option to turn this off.\n\nNCAA 07 touts \"momentum\" as a key element to gameplay, meaning that when you make a big play, your team gets on a roll and the big plays just keep getting easier and easier to pull off.  I wasn't a fan of this idea before I'd played because I don't like too much artificial tampering with the competitive balance.  However, when actually playing the game, the results are suitably subdued - at its peak, you only get a 5-point boost to your team's performance attributes.  So don't worry about getting trounced by lesser opponents just because they put together a string of lucky plays.  Talent still wins out in this game.\n\nIntroduced with last year's version, the \"matchup stick\" let you use the right analog stick to evaluate individual matchups - the camera zooms out to field width and shows player skill level and composure for particular matchups, e.g. wideouts vs. defensive backfield, o-line vs. d-line, or QB/RB vs. linebackers.  It's a nice feature that allows you to see if you've got any potential mismatches to exploit from play to play, giving you an idea of which receiver to key on or maybe even enough insight to audible a different play.  With NCAA 07, you've now got a lot of options of how to actually do something with this information before the snap.  You can slide protections, dynamically change individual coverage schemes, or set up a pass rusher to guess the snap count for a devastating charge into the backfield.  This remains one of the strengths of the NCAA series, and it's anyone's guess as to why EA's Madden franchise doesn't have it.\n\nThe kicking game has been revamped this year as well, with some mixed results.  The old familiar power/accuracy meter has been put on steroids and now looks like a shifting, spinning guage from a jumbo jet cockpit.  It's confusing to say the least and EA apparently knew it - there's one-button access to a kicking-specific help screen whenever you line up to kick.  Also, you have to use the analog sticks to control the kick now, but the action happens so fast that there's no real benefit to it.  However, the new kicking game is a big improvement in two areas:  onside kicks and fakes.  When you line up for an onside kick, the meter is replaced completely with a picture of a football.  You aim crosshairs either high or low on the ball and then set your power to truly control whether you squib it on the ground or bounce it into the air and up for grabs.  This is an element of realism that's long overdue in all football games.  As for fakes, you now have one-button access while at the line of scrimmage to switch from a real kick/punt to a fake.  This really streamlines the process and allows you to make the decision based on how the defense has lined up.\n\nPRESENTATION\n\nBut is NCAA 07 more than just Madden dusting off its old varsity jacket? To quote the coach once again, \"Ab-so-lutely\". The makers of the game paid painstaking attention to detail here, making NCAA 07 truly a payoff for fans of the college game. The stadiums are intricately rendered - I play my dynasty as a mid-major (Miami, OH) and even their field is accurate right down to the dorms in the distance being accurately drawn and properly placed. As best I can tell, all of the MAC fields are like this, so enjoyment of that home field experience isn't limited to just fans of the biggest programs at the biggest conferences. This year's game even includes division 1-AA and NAIA schools. Want more evidence of what a massive tribute to the college game this is? Here goes: Mascots? Check. Rivalry games with their historic trophies? Check. All year-end awards? Check. Fight songs? Well, NCAA 07 earns an incomplete for this one. Not all of the fight songs are there - some just get generic march music and drumlines - but I'm guessing that was more due to legal rights than effort by the developers. Fans of ESPN's College Gameday program will be happy to know that Lee Corso does his signature donning of the mascot's head during his pre-game pick.\n\nThis year's menus don't have quite as much of the old school classic college football look to them, but they're still true to the game.  Nothing is worse than games whose menus all look like graphics from the weather portion of the evening news.  The NCAA series uses fight songs and school-specific pictures during the menus to put you into the college experience.  Last year's innovative decision to depict dynasty information as stories from \"Sports Illustrated\" magazine is back again, but \"ESPN The Magazine\" is now the title of choice.  The effect is still a dramatic improvement over traditional menus and stats.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nPlayer models are about the best that this generation of console can deliver. Clarity and sharpness can suffer a bit when looking at a pile of players in the wide field view, but up-close, they look great. The real strength is in the massive stockpile of fluid, natural animations and the way that the game combines them. String together some impressive combinations of moves and you'll find yourself watching the replay over and over again (it's a shame that you can't save them).\n\nThe in-studio pre-game show is the biggest low-point, exposing EA's longtime problem with weird lighting of facial models. Everyone at the desk seems to be underlit, making them look sinister. Plus, their movements are surprisingly robotic. But in terms of importance, these problems are miniscule - the developers placed their efforts on the on-the-field action where it belongs.\n\nSOUND\n\nIn-game commentary is provided by the familiar voices of Brad Nessler, Lee Corso and Kirk Herbstreit. The game contains tons of commentary clips, but you will hear a lot of the same lines over and over again once you've played a few seasons. On the other hand, I've played dynasties into the 10-year range and the game still occasionally surprises me with a new clip here and there.  NCAA 07 generally does a good job of mixing commentary up and also playing the right clips at the appropriate times. Nevertheless, if you're not a big fan of Corso and Herbstreit's Abbott-and-Costello routine, maybe you'd be better off turning off the commentary. Crowd noise including chants and school bands is well-delivered.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe NCAA series stands on its own as great football titles - it delivers superior gameplay, and immersive college feel, and innovations that other games (ahem, Madden development team) should be \"borrowing\".  All combined, this is the way that videogames should function, especially in the sports genre - intuitive controls mix with massive attention to detail to result in gameplay that's addictive fun.  On the downside, NCAA 07 is very, very similar to last year's breakthrough release, and every-year fans of the series may feel that they've not been given enough this year to justify the layout.\n\nPROS\n\n* The variety of gameplay modes, highlighted by a dynasty mode that just keeps getting better, will keep this game fresh and interesting for a long time to come\n\n* Massive attention to detail will satisfy any college football fan regardless of whichever school you follow - the mascots, the stadiums, the rivalries, and (most of) the fights songs are all meticulously recreated here.\n\n* In-game controls are very intuitive and well-designed, leading to lots of fun with a short learning curve\n\n* Game graphics/animations are generally smooth, extremely realistic and just plain fun to watch\n\n* Integration with Madden by exporting players/draft classes\n\nCONS\n\n* There is a lot of repeat content from NCAA 06 - you quickly feel that you've been charged full price for a game that already own\n\n* While more detailed than last year's \"Race for the Heisman\", the Campus Legend is still gimmicky and also boring after a while\n\n* The revamped kicking game is unnecessisarily confusing in parts\n\n* Studio graphics have awful character models and lighting oddities that are typical for EA titles", "summary": "EA's All-American Gets Redshirted after Its Breakout Season", "unixReviewTime": 1153267200}

My latest entry into the virtual sports world is MLB 2K8. ( I got it for free as a promotion and finally dusted it off to try it out.) When I first started playing this game, I was frustrated and mad because the user interface (Total Control) for pitching, throwing, and batting were difficult to understand and use.\n\nBut having ADHD tendencies meant my hyper-focusing traits kicked in and I wouldn't give up on how to operate and play this game. After spending a great deal of time in practicing pitching, I finally nailed down the \"Total Control\" aspects of using the joystick on my game controller. Surprisingly, this system gives you a real feeling of actually pitching the ball. There is skill involved and if you make a mental mistake of serving up a \"meatball\" pitch or a big juicy floater for the batter to hit, chances are that it will be slammed out of the park.\n\nThis game could have been a lot better if there was a real practice mode where you could pitch, bat, and field to figure out how the game works. The instructions in the game and manual could use some major improvement too.\n\nYou can adjust many aspects of this game by tuning it to your skill level, etc. They've got all sorts of game modes, ways to get new players, franchise mode, and lots of minutia that some baseball fans will enjoy. But because I'm just a regular Joe who likes sports games, the basic play was good enough for me. I can always dig deeper into the game if I want to later.\n\nBut the game has a few bugs in it that bring the game down a bit. The AI defense sometimes has the players standing around after a line drive to third base because the coding, evidently, can't figure out how to move the defense. It's kind of comical as I round the bases with the third baseman and shortstop just standing there.\n\nThe total control fielding isn't something that I've figured out yet. It doesn't make much sense to me and there are no instructions or details about what the power meter does or how you are supposed to work this setting.\n\nI like the commentators and there's a good deal of variety in their remarks to make the game interesting. The sound engineers did a fantastic job of capturing the feel of a baseball park and the crowd groans, cheers, and boos when the team is doing well, bad or otherwise.\n\nOverall, because I'm not a real baseball fan and don't understand all the intricacies of play, I can probably enjoy this game more than a real fan who can point out all the errors. But for me, it's a nice game that is fun.", "summary": "Good game for non-baseball fans", "unixReviewTime": 1379894400}

There are many different modes start with such as story mode, online mode, tournament mode and challenge mode. Street fighter 4 is a good fighting game worth playing. There are a number of mechanics that long time fans would have to learn and remaster in order to understand the gameplay. Each character has a variety of normal attacks and Special Moves to take advantage and one of my favorite part about Street Fighter IV is the Focus system, which allows a character to charge up an attack that will knock the opponent down if it connects properly. Players who want to get more into the technical key of it all will learn that the Focus Attack can also absorb incoming attacks which can gives the player a better edge during an online match. In this way, the Focus Attack becomes a defensive technique as well as an offensive one. There are two meters that can be used in a match: the Super meter and the Ultra meter. The Super meter fills as you land attacks and the Ultra meter goes up as you're getting hit. You can use the Super meter to execute Super Combos that can be chained together to bring your enemies health faster. On the other hand, you can use the Ultra meter for an Ultra Combos which are more devastating attacks that can change the fight to win easily. Overall good game and i give it a 9.0 for being a unique fighting game and enjoy playing it with friends.\n\n8.7  Presentation\nIt well-polished and clean, with PS3 and 360 versions which are both the same.

And the music--oh the music!  Although every area of the city has different background music, they are all nothing more than 25-second loops that get tiresome very quickly, especially the downtown street music.  I eventually found myself turning down the music volume to zero.\n\nThe system of recruiting the city's some 100+ thugs onto your side--sometimes through negotiation and other times through beating their brains in and forcing them to become your lackeys--seemed a little gimmicky: there really is no reason to have so many recruitable characters because you'll soon start to notice that there are only five or six different types of fighters (kickboxer, martial artist, grappler, weapon master, etc).  Also, some characters have unique skills like lock-picking, pickpocketing, and stealing cars which adds an additional layer to the game but ultimately is not deep enough to hold your interest.\n\nAlso there is a glitch in the game which causes the vibration feature of your controller to be activated constantly.  In the game you can carry a maximum of 200 items and/or weapons at once, and when I reached this number and got to a certain point in Chapter 6, my controller started vibrating and would not stop.  I discovered the source of this glitch almost by accident.  Needless to say I sold some items I didn't need, and the glitch went away.  The problem is that there is no way for you to keep track of how many items and/or weapons you have simply by looking at your menus; you MUST go to a store and choose the \"sell possessions\" option to be able to see how much stuff you currently have.  This can get quite annoying, so you should always sell stuff you don't absolutely need.\n\nOn the plus side: I found the voice acting to be quite adequate (what little of it there was), and by adequate I mean it was good enough to keep me from wanting to cut off my ears.  The fighting engine is surprisingly robust, and it is indeed the meat of the game.  When you get into a horizontal view 1-on-1 fight, it almost feels like you're playing Street Fighter 2 again.  Each character has an ample list of moves that are relatively easy to execute, and you can learn more as the game progresses.  Being able to dress your character in different outfits was a nice touch (although it's very disturbing to give one of the guys a mini skirt).  You'll actually find that there is a surprising number of clothes, tattoos, and plastic surgery options that you can unlock by interrogating the right people.\n\nAnd the game's smooth, streamlined interface you use to buy/sell/change clothes is what GTA San Andreas should have had.  Remember the time-consuming interface in GTA where CJ goes into the closet, puts on the shirt you want, and comes back out and poses?  Am I the only one who hated that system?  In this game, you can change clothes in a tenth of the time.  That's one thing this game actually does BETTER than GTA.\n\nCapcom obviously did not give the developing team a very large budget, which is regrettable because this game had a chance to shine in a market that is slowly becoming cluttered with all the GTA clones (True Crime, Total Overdose, The Warriors, etc).  Only if the developers had more to work with, because--don't laugh--they were on to something here.", "summary": "Not as dismal as some people say", "unixReviewTime": 1140393600}

The last one I owned for my 360 was a $300 Turtle Beach. In all but one or two areas, this model beats it for half the price.\n\nOverall construction is SUPERB compared to all older models. The cords are not nearly as fragile and thin. They are thick, braided and solid.

A number of reviewers have complained about a \"popping\" sound, but I never heard the slightest hint of it.\n\nNo batteries, which is a nice feature, but this means that you are tethered to the controller if you want to use it. My old model allowed me to use it to listen to music or the tv without the controller at all. I only needed that if I wanted to chat.\n\nThe other nice feature is you don't have to hook up that stupid little box to your TV or your Xbox--there isn't one. VERY NICE! The earcups are comfortable for extended playing sessions. And what do I mean by extended sessions? 8 hours or more. Volume controls are all MUCH more accessible than past models. Everything is right at your finger tips instead of having to fumble around on the headset trying to find the game volume. There are also independent volume controls for chat and game volume, but they can take some getting used to.\n\nThe one significant complaint that I have is about a feature that older models have, but this one doesn't. The earcups fit so securely over your ears, that you can barely hear yourself talk--and I mean BARELY. Older models would play your voice over the headset so you could hear yourself, which was a very nice feature and I didn't realize how much I would miss it.

An alien race known as the Chimera have spread through Europe and are infecting humans virally, which causes them to mutate into similar Chimeran monsters. Hale eventually saves Britain, but is believed to have been killed in action. Resistance 2 starts off with the same cutscene that the first game ended with; Nathan Hale being picked up by the Special Forces. He is then transported to the United States where the battle is continuing. Hale is now a part of a Chimeran infected elite squad called the Sentinels and has to defend the US from the invasion. I found the story to be pretty cool because it is an alternate take on history. I love everything about history and alternate versions of history and this was definitely a cool way of considering how things could have changed after World War II. Most of the time I find myself not caring whatsoever about the story in a first person shooter but Insomniac found an interesting way of making the story actually matter. You want to save the United States from invasion. You want to stop the unknown forces from destroying the planet. Above all else, you want to know what in the world is even going on and how all of this began.\n\nPresentation:\n\n  After my time with the first game, I thought that Resistance 2 was probably going to look like crap; I was severely mistaken. That does not mean that this game blew me away with its presentation by any means, but it was good. It took a giant step forward from the first game, which comes as no surprise since it was developed as a launch title on the PlayStation 3. The graphics were above what you would expect from a sci-fi FPS released in 2008. It reminds me a lot of games like Killzone 2 and Bulletstorm that were both released later on. The voice acting was superb so there is nothing really to complain about here. Other than your typical yelling and screaming from soldiers during missions, the only other real dialogue is during the cutscenes. Speaking of the cutscenes, I believe that they were placed evenly throughout the game. This is not one of those games where you can expect to play for an hour and then watch cutscenes for an hour. Normally they lasted about two minutes at most so you were never out of the game for very long. They explained what they had to and then put you into the next mission. There were also a few minor cutscenes in the middle of missions in order to show you things they way Insomniac intended for you to see them, and so you didn't miss them. A quick example would be that you go through a hall and something starts happening outside the window; the game will take control of your character and turn you so that you can see what is happening outside, and then give you the control back. This is a great way to show you everything you need to see because otherwise you could miss all sorts of things if you weren't taking your time.\n\nGameplay:\n\n  This is not your typical first person shooter that you can mindlessly shoot your way through really fast. It plays just like any other FPS would in that you can run, shoot, throw grenades, change weapons, etc. The major difference is that this game is not easy by any means. Even on easy mode (yes I played it on the easiest mode), this game was freaking difficult. There were numerous occasions where I set the controller down and thought that there was no way I would ever be able to finish the game. I always ended up coming back once I calmed down and was able to figure out how to get past the parts I was stuck on. Resistance 2 is so difficult for a few reasons. First, there are many different kinds of enemies and second, some levels drop you in with what seems like unlimited enemies. The different kinds of enemies are difficult because they don't all die as easily, they have different styles of attacks, and some are faster than others. You have to pay attention to who you are shooting at or else you could end up dead quickly. The seemingly unlimited enemies are difficult for obvious reasons. I do not think that there are many situations in the game, if at all, that there are actually unlimited enemies, but it sure seemed like it. Sometimes, if you don't take out the front line of enemies fast enough their backups will start swarming into the area and then you are left with tons of enemies to kill all at once. This game makes taking cover almost mandatory because if you try to run out in front of 20 enemies all firing at you at once you will die VERY fast. I hate taking cover in games so it was a difficult concept for me to learn, but eventually I was able to take advantage of all of the debris lying around every map for cover.\n\n  Gameplay also changes based on the weapons you choose to use; and there are tons of them. This game is set in an alternate history where an alien invasion happens. Rather than only having post World War II guns, you also have the option of using a multitude of alien weaponry. This makes the game much more fun than a normal military FPS. I will give you some examples of weapons I found extremely fun to use. The first that you get a chance to use in the game is a magnum. This in itself is not all that exciting, but it has a secondary attachment on it that is freaking amazing; an explosive detonator for each bullet. All you have to do is fire the magnum like normal by hitting R1 and wherever the bullet hits it will stick, then you hit R2 to make the bullet explode. There are also a few laser assault rifles in the game as well that have cool secondary attachments like being able to tag your enemies. This allows you to see them behind walls and cover so that you know where they are at all times until the tag wears off. My favorite weapon in the game is called the Auger. This is a laser-like assault rifle that allows you to actually shoot through walls. While wielding the Auger, you can see all of the enemies in the area behind the walls automatically until you change weapons. This makes shooting them through cover extremely easy and fun. Its secondary attachment lets you throw down a giant force field shield in front of you to block any incoming bullets, but still allows you to shoot through it with your Auger. I had a ton of fun with all of these weapons; it really changed the mundane FPS shooter mechanics that most games have.\n\nThe Verdict: 8.0 out of 10\n\n  Resistance 2 is one of the better first person shooters I have played in a long time. While most shooters stick to the same boring gunplay, Resistance 2 changes it up by making it difficult. I love that there are several different enemy types that you had to learn to change your play style for. I love the fact that the game is set in an alternate past. It is cool to see soldiers using futuristic alien weapons during the 1950s. As a history major I thought the story was a really cool take on what the Cold War could have been. This is not a game for everyone because of its sci-fi story, but the solid first person shooter mechanics make it a game worth playing for anyone who loves a good shooter.", "summary": "I love alt History", "unixReviewTime": 1387411200}

I thought, well, it's not 60 bucks anymore; why not give it a try.\n\nI am VERY glad that I did. This game has a HUGE map (biggest I have seen; as big as Oblivion GTA San Andreas, GTAIV, etc are, this is bigger than probably all those games and more COMBINED, I mean, seriously), there are TONS of things to do, all sorts of vehicles, main story missions, faction missions, probably thousand of locations (cities, towns, villages, settlements) to explore for \"weapon parts\" \"auto parts\" \"armor parts\" and so on (these are the games version of \"Hidden Packages), and you can do whatever you want, and kill whomever you want--in fact that is the POINT OF THE GAME, to cause as much mayhem and destruction (\"CHAOS\" as the game calls it), that you can! Causing \"CHAOS\" actually advances your character--as you perpetrate the mayhem, this unlocks future missions, sort of like \"respect\" does in the Saints Row games. You are especially rewarded for destroying structures, vehicles, antennas, sat dishes, etc, marked as government property. Who wouldn't find THAT fun, lol. Kill a few civilians in a town of any size? The military responds and tries to take you out. I especially like finding a gas station, making the pumps blow up, and then fighting the government goons that show up.\n\nThere IS a story line, that sort of continues the one from the last game, but the story really, here, is secondary. Your object, again, is to cause mayhem and destruction to unlock more missions. When you are on a main or \"Agency\" mission, this advances the story. Other missions are for the factions, you help various gangs take over sectors of the island (I guess so that they can eventually control enough to over throw the dictator, but I haven't got that far yet), when you aren't on any kind of mission, it's basically free roam--you knock someone off their motorcycle, grab their car or whatnot, and wander around randomly causing as much death  and destruction as you can, and exploring every where for those \"packages.\" I found one thing called an \"air challenge\" where you jump into a single engine tail dragger plane, and try to fly through a course of markers in the air. I missed the third one, said the heck with it, and flew around for awhile looking at the area. By the way, there are numerous airports! I found one, landed there, (It turned out to be Panua international). It gave me credit for finding the location. But now, I was like where the hell am I? lol\n\nOne thing though, this map is HUGE. I know I keep saying that, but until you see it you won't believe it. It can take a LONG time to go from one end to the other. Even with a car, (or better a copter or plane), it will take a LONG TIME. By the way the zip line and parachute are still in the game. See a low flying helicopter? Zip line it, and jack it! If it's a military one, attack things with it!\n\nNow, I have to mention the ONLY thing I DON'T like about this game. The ONLY thing. THE SAVE SYSTEM. The way it works is, when you are on a mission, there is auto save, that makes \"checkpoints\" for you (SIGH. DAMN IT). So, if you die, and you will, (this game is fun, but it is NOT necessarily easy---you are usually outnumbered with not that much ammo, relatively), the game takes you back to your previous check point. The problem with \"check points\" is they don't save every thing you have done, found, etc between them. So back to the last check point, start all over from you were. GOD that is ANNOYING. Once you do get to the NEXT one, then whatever you accomplished is saved, but not until then. There are \"save slots\" but this is NOT  a quick save. If you are on a mission, and try to load your manual save, you will start the the last checkpoint, with nothing new saved. If you are NOT on a mission, the manual save will usually save any progress in the statistics that it follows, but you will NOT spawn were you left off, you will appear back at the nearest \"safe location\" to wherever you were. If you DIE outside a mission, the game will auto save any new things you found, changes to your stats, etc. But again, you will spawn at the closest \"base.\" Quite frankly, if it were not for this, the game would have got 5 stars from me, not 4. But I cannot, in this day and age, understand why we cannot have a quick save, that will save what you have done, and start you back at the location that you were last. Ugh.\n\nBut with all that said, this is probably the most fun \"sandbox\" game I have ever played. It is the PERFECT game for, if you don't have too long to play, if you don't care that much about story line/completion, etc, or if you just want to put the disc in and see how much destruction you can cause before they kill you.\n\nHIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

Yes, because not everyone has complained of this problem so maybe it is just me. I am considering emailing logitech about it. But i don't think they will do anything for me.

In almost every subject that I'm about to write about, which is sad.\n\nGraphics: 9/10\nPros:\nIt's amazing how good the grahics are, very smoothed out, with lots of textures. I tell you, I've never seen a game so colorful, so bright. Almost everything is pretty well detailed.\nCons:\nAll the colors are great and fun in a Mario game, but there's just too much of that in this. It really bothers my eyes sometimes. I'm confused here, why is Yoshi all diferent. What's going on with Orange, Purple, Yellow, Pink?!?!? What happend to Green? It's really stupid, just because you gobble a banana, dosn't mean your going to turn that color.\n\nSound: 7/10\nPros:\nVery well done in this game, I enjoy lishening to it. Backround music is enjoyable. A new small feature they added, is when Mario is weak and low on health, his voice will get quieter and weaker, a neat little feature.\nCons:\nMario's voice will bug you like crazy. When your bellyhopping, the \"hah\" noise is very distrating and annoying that I could round kick him in the throat so he couldn't say anything. The most downright annoying thing in this game, are the island fatties. When you talk to them, instead of giving you advise, they might say something like \"Oh, I love the sunset tonight,\".\n\nGameplay: 5/10\n Sometimes I'll get a speed nozzle, spray the fatso's in the pants then I'll flee, with the speed nozzle, that's how annoying they are, you know, I think that the designers of this game ran out of ideas very quickly, because Mario's mission is to collect all the shine sprites (what happend to stars?). 20 of these sprites are in the hands of these fools on the island. It's really ridiculous. The levels are downright terrible, and you can only go for 1 shine at a time, were in SM64, you could get for 4 stars if you felt like it. It's rare that you'll be stomping anything, and the only point in doing so is to collect coins for health. Another thing about the levels, their all the same, nothing's defferent about any of them. SM64 we got volcano, desert, water worlds and SMS, we have paradise, that's it. Oh, there's a park of paradise, and a hotel of paradise, forgot to tell you that.\n\nSecrets/Unlockables: 6/10\nThey put alot of this stuff in this game, 1/3 of the sprites are Secret. One thing I hate about this game, the blue coins. First off, it seems pretty neat, but when you discover that you need to get blue coins to help collect every single sprite, this turns into a hassle. Enough about all the bad stuff, let's talk about the nozzles. There are 3 types, a hover (makes you hover in air for a few seconds), a rocket (you can soar high in the air) and a speed nozzle (you can go 5x faster then you normally run). This gave the game some taste. The rocket nozzle helped me unlock 3 hidden sprites (which is actullay pretty good) and the speed got me about 7 hidden shines.\n\nContorls: 8/10\nI don't know why people find the controls slopply, I say it works out well, very easy to learn too. Aiming the spray nozzle is tricky like 1 star people said, but it just takes a little practice to get good at it. The camera controls are very disrupting, sure you can move the camera, but if your in a certain spot, the camera won't move a notch.\n\nOverall:6.5/10\nThe game is very enjoyable, but they changed the story a little to much to call it a Mario game.", "summary": "Good,and bad", "unixReviewTime": 1117065600}

I initially wanted the Sunset Overdrive bundle as that game seemed more interesting to me than the Assassin's creed two-pack (I already have AC Black Flag for 360), but that particular bundle was not in stock so I was left choosing between the Call of Duty Advanced Warfare edition bundle, and the AC bundle with and without Kinect; $450 for AC w/kinect or for COD AW edition; or $350 for the AC w/o Kinect.\n\nAfter rationalizing, I realized that I had wished I had Kinect for 360 because Kinect Sports was so fun, and that I probably wouldn't spend $100-150 to get it in the future as was the case with the 360, so I  went ahead and got the $450 Kinect bundle with Assassins creed.  Regarding the COD Advanced Warfare edition, I believe that 1tb should be standard, and that $100 was too much for 500gb of memory given the low cost of external hard drives (xbox one can use any PC external hard drive via USB), and the looks of the console and controller didn't blow me away (a note on the controller: there are no colors on the buttons, but rather four, colored arrows in the small circle between the buttons, that may be an issue for some folks).\n\nUnboxing: this thing looks sweet, it was very quick and easy to get it out of the box, plugged into my tv, and downloading Call of Duty Advanced Warfare.

It wasn't as polished as say Oblivion or Fallout, though it was fun for what it was.\n\n=== Heritage\nThis is more of a warning to hardcore Gothic fans than a gripe about the game.  If you think this is a must-buy because \"Gothic\" is in the name, read on.  Read the reviews for the PC version (which is where Gothic has its roots) and you'll see what I mean.\n\nAs it turns out, this game could not be further away from its predecessors.  It has absolutely nothing in common with Gotchic 1 - 3 save for the fact that Diego is in the game.  The game should have been called, \"Arcania: Hoping You'll Buy It Because We Put Gothic In The Name\".  In and of itself, this isn't a bad thing.  Plenty of sequels have been heavily modified since the first, in much better ways.  This game is nothing like it's predecessors in all the wrong ways.\n\n=== Story\nMy biggest gripe with the game is the \"false summit\" style of storytelling.  You spend about 95% of the game running what are effectively errands that don't move the story forwards.  It's an utterly frustrating way to spend such a huge amount of time (and this game is loooong).  Compare this to something like Mass Effect 2 or Dragon Age where everything you do is in the name of achieving your objective (or one step away from it).  In Arcania, you're running absolutely ridiculous amounts of errands that have nothing to do with the plot, in order to get plot details.\n\nThere's a plot there for sure, but it's hidden behind hours of nonsensical quests.  Here's an example:\n\nMass Effect 2: \"Investigate a colony for clues about why the antagonist attacked it.\"\nArcania: \"I know where you need to go next, but you need to get me six beehives before I'll tell you.\"\n\nWhat blows my mind is that the developers of the game admit this is an issue!  Your character, in the game, begins to gripe about all the nonsensical errands he's sent on.  About halfway through the game, your character begins to state (groaning almost) his frustration about no one helping him without first making him run some mindless, story-void errand.  And this continues until the end of the game.  It's as if they thought that if he spoke the words, the player would mind it less.\n\n=== Gameplay\nThis game is incredibly easy on regular difficulty.  It's simplistic, repetitive and dull.  I died twice and that was because I (admittedly) became careless, getting sick of the non-story and rushing through sections of the game.  You'll be doing the same thing at hour 30 as you did at hour 3.\n\nThere's a base set of combat actions, plus a couple of spells and couple of skills you can optionally learn.  They're all very basic though, and after a few hours in, you'll be doing everything you'll be doing when you finish the game.\n\n=== Summary\nBy the end, I was skipping so much of the optional content because the game had just become a bore.  There's no variety to combat, the quests are mindless, and the plot is largely invisible.  I kept activating my \"rune of the X winds\"  and ran past mobs until they reset and left me alone.\n\nStrongly suggest passing.\n\nGet Fable 3, Rock Band 3, Fallout Vegas, etc. instead.

It is sturdy, noise isolating, and the cushions are made of memory foam, which makes them quite comfortable to wear. And it is also very easy to control with the headset adapter. Also keep in mind these are supposed to be wired to the controller, so if you are looking for wireless this may not be the set for you. Having also a PS4 I am kind of used to having a cable running to the controller so this was not a problem for me.\n\nBut how does the XO7 sound? The sound was simply amazing, I have owned other headsets in the past (for both Xbox and PS3) so having prior sets as a point of reference, I thought the sound coming from these was good, quite good (considering it is stereo only, with surround effect). The one thing I loved the most is that the XO7 runs on your device's power. So, forget about having to charge the battery of both your controller and the headset, you can use this anytime (as long as the controller is charged, of course)\n\nI tested it with my iPod and iPhone and I was very happy to be able to simply plug and play, and again, the sound that this headset produces is great.

Witches, bears, black magic, lunatics with machetes are fine by me. What I can't tolerate, no matter how comfortable my surroundings might be, is little girl ghosts. Worst still little girl ghosts with a massive cob on. Add a bright red dress and lank long black hair draped over a dreaded face - see The Ring - mixed with that little freak cloaked in a red rainmac from Don't Look Now and you've royally got me. Computer games are supposed to be about fun and full of joyousness, not grown men being obliterated by ghosts. What's the world coming to when a little girl craves to see such anguish in the faces of men? These are strange times, strange times indeed.\n\nBearing all that in mind there is one job that I wouldn't do for all the women on the internet - be a member of F.E.A.R. For those unfamiliar with such an unnerving acronym it means: First Encounter Assault Recon. These bad boys don't muck about with terrorists or rescue hostages from jungles and all the rest of it. No. Members of F.E.A.R. are elite soldiers trained to deal with situations that normal people just wouldn't be able to handle. So if there's a mean supernatural force of gargantuan proportions posing a threat to national security, who you gonna call? F.E.A.R. I'm not talking Most Haunted here either - Derek Acorah would be splashing his pants within minutes of playing this - sadly so was I.\n\nPredictably you play the new kid on the block. You don't speak and your colleagues doubt you - although bizarrely despite being a part of a 'team' you spend the entire game fighting alone. They think you're not made of the right stuff, that under pressure you'll do a runner faster than Thierry Henry on speed. Very little about the plot is given away initially - you're a bit special - you're training results scored off the charts - there's some evilness to be dealt with and that's about it. Rather pleasingly one of F.E.A.R.'s strong points is the narrative, but more importantly how it is delivered to you. Where most FPS use cut scenes to move the plot forward F.E.A.R. is subtler. You'll hear whispers that suggest future events, characters will react to you in a certain way suggestion something isn't right. Messages on phones, note books and the occasional cut scene - however these never really feel traditional as they link seamlessly into the action, so much so that you barely notice that you're not in control anymore.\n\nWithin minutes of starting you're running down corridor upon corridor while being treated to the kind of subtle psychological scare tactics usually found in far eastern horror movies - glimpses of people behind doors, flashes of gore and evil innuendo. Similar to the excellent Condemned in atmosphere, F.E.A.R. tightens the vice on your nerves and builds tension like the very best horror movies. While the physics engine pales compared to Half Life 2, the world you're a part of is tangible - objects can be manipulated and you'll often mess your pants as inane objects are placed in your path as you run down dimly lit corridors. Such is the tension that you'll scream when you bump into an empty drinks can and it goes flying.\n\nSee through F.E.A.R.'s horror niche and you'll find a pretty decent shooter in there as well. Next-generation perhaps it isn't, but the lack of any slowdown despite the barrage of explosions and bodies flying mean that you can play a highly demanding PC game smoothly on the 360. F.E.A.R. has another trick up its sleeve in the slow mo feature - there is nothing original about it, Max Payne was doing the whole bullet time thing back in 2001. On the 360 however it's a different kettle of shrapnel - a visual spectacular that looks so good it could have been taken straight out of The Matrix. Bits of debris fly out, dust is thrown up and walls crumble as you blast your way through your enemy. The point being that when you're overwhelmed with enemies you can use your 'special abilities' to dish out the pain. The combat system is something to marvel at - going in guns blazing is going to get you capped and shooting from behind cover is equally perilous as the AI is such that they will flank you and pop you one before too long. In order to progress through the battlegrounds you have to combine the slow-mo feature with melee attacks as well unleashing a barrage of lead.\n\nFor all the explosions and slow-mo arse whipping F.E.A.R. remains a generic FPS. The AI is superb and the scary bits are nothing short of cinematic, but there is an awful lot of running and gunning. While this might not be a negative factor for an hour or two, the similarity between weapons only illuminates the lack of diversity on offer. F.E.A.R. is also a short game, but with the said lack of variety this isn't necessarily a bad thing - imagine one big kaboom as opposed to a peppered drawn out series of explosions. These days longevity can usually be found online anyway - F.E.A.R. offers an array of game types all familiar to the genre: capture the flag, deathmatch, etc.\n\nHowever any frustrations that you might have with this will be easily overshadowed by the emotions it invokes within you. F.E.A.R. made me react like no other game can - one particular nerve shredding point literally forced me to involuntarily throw the pad from my hands - the glorious thing about this is that very little happened on screen, it was all about suggestion and even the world's greatest horror movies would do well to learn from Monolith's creation.\n\nA game that fashions such primal fear and mixes it with an always-compulsive if a little generic shooter action can only be a positive thing for gaming. What's on offer here is sheer ingenuity in manufacturing an atmosphere that creeps right into the room you're sitting in - and that's playing it in broad daylight at three in the afternoon. If you like you shooting with a dollop of tangible fear, F.E.A.R. is for you.", "summary": "Real FEAR?", "unixReviewTime": 1163808000}

I loved the environment and I thought the graphics in this game were amazing. For instance, the tree's and grass sway in the wind and will catch fire causing a brush blaze. You can use this to your advantage to trap/kill enemies. Also, the real time shadows and the sun cycle that changes as the day goes on, are also amazing; if you stand in the same spot for a long time you can see the sun as it moves through the sky and all the shadows change position. The last thing I liked was the effect that happens when you are really hurt and you try to heal yourself; your character will do something like push a bullet through his arm by sticking his finger in the bullet hole. Another thing is that if you pick up an enemy gun it would be in crappy condition and jam; another amazing effect but also stupid because why would i pick up a gun when it jams and why doesn't it jam for the enemies when they are firing it? Anyway still cool.  All of these things I just mentioned about the game I loved and I don't think I had really seen anything like the effects in this game (at the time it was released). I basically did not like anything else about the game, I would probably say that I hated everything else but that could be because I think I did play it on hard. Ok, I hated how... it would always take me about a full magazine of ammo from my gun to kill a guy, hated taking 10 min per quest to drive back and forth across the map, hated driving because every half mile there is a camp of men shooting and then following me(that just reappear), I didn't really like the guns- didn't work well and it was hard for me to get one I liked and then you have to store them to use later. So, overall I do have some respect for this game because it did have some great small features that I had not seen before, but overall I would just be really frustrated the whole time playing it and was sick off all the crappy game play and stupid parts of the game that I had to keep putting up with. Not the storyline of the original, didn't like multiplayer, hated most everything important about the game.

But in this installment in the series, it's almost like the shortcomings are the only things left.  They took the least fun and most annoying features of Dynasty Warriors 4 and made it the sole purpose for Dynasty Warriors 4:  Empires, and the result is a supremely monotonous and charmless game.\n\nFirst of all, it's as if they felt that the old enemies weren't powerful enough, with their dozens of archers interrupting your every move, ally soldiers who love standing around watching you get pummeled, unlimited Musou (special) attacks for enemy generals, and overlarge maps that take forever to navigate.  Now to add to your misery you have:\n\n- Enemy generals who respawn indefinitely;\n\n- Enemy troops no longer have to emerge at a gate; they can literally materialize beside you from thin air;\n\n- Enemy commanders can pull one six-hit combo that takes half your health;\n\n- The player can be infinitely juggled so that you can lose your entire life bar if you fall down just once.  If the computer opponent happens to be behind you, you may as well kiss the fight goodbye;\n\n- There's a new type of enemy, the Sorceress, who can shoot endless flame/ice/lightning at you so that you won't be able to get up for about a minute straight;\n\n- Special items aren't available every turn; you have to wait for some kind of production schedule;\n\n- There's a low limit as to how many generals you can have in your roster;\n\n- And no, your characters, items and achievements from Dynasty Warriors 4 don't carry over.\n\nThe game mechanics have been altered so that now the emphasis isn't on fighting (uh, isn't this a fighting game?), but capturing these annoying \"strongholds\".  And to do that, you have to kill every single enemy within a large radius.  So if one enemy troop hides in a nook from you, you'll have to run around looking for him.  Also, you now have to run from place to place and ignore enemy generals just to capture these strongholds fast enough that your allies don't screw you up in your other locations.  Level after level of this -- it's amazingly dreary.  You can forget about using some of your more eccentric generals; the only characters that matter now are ones with a very long weapon range and crowd-control abilities.  I may have 10 characters available, but the fighting mechanics (and super-cheap computer opponents) mean that I only use two, Xu Huang and Lu Bu.  They may as well have gotten rid of all the other available characters, because trying to use Zhang Jiao or Meng Huo in this game is suicide.\n\nThe gaming equivalent of an eternal root canal.

You play as 1 of 4 survivors (Zoey the college student, Bill the war veteran, Francis the biker, Louis the IT guy). The character doesn't seem to matter, it's just a different voice and skin. They will talk to alert you of things like health, weapons, reloading and where you should go next. Left 4 Dead is geared toward online multiplayer, but you can play solo through the game where your computer partners are competent enough, but need to be guided by you. Instead of online multiplayer where the other players seem to just run right through each level.\n\nThe controls are simple, point and click to shoot like any first person shooter, right mouse button is for melee for when foes swarm around you and they will. You have a long range weapon (shotguns, oozies, assault rifles and so on), a pistol (or 2) with limitless ammo, a medipack to restore your health or someone else's, pain pills that will temporarily give you a health boost and finally an explosive thrown weapon like a flaming cocktail or pipe bomb. You can jump or crouch for better weapon accuracy and that's it. The combat feels very limited because of this.\n\nThe big drawing point to the game is some sort of smart engine called the director that will generate random zombies to come at you, so no play through is the same twice. Such as a zombie that was at point A of your first play through might be a wall of zombies or no zombies, or a female zombie in your next play through. These zombies will race toward you after a few moments of shuffling their feet that might result in your terror, but an entire game of zombies running to you gets old very quickly. Zombies can climb up areas, go under truck trailers and the animations are good in general. Weapons and ammo scattered outside of safe rooms will not be in the same place twice.\n\nThe game is broken into campaigns and levels that you can access any one at any time. The campaigns are brief and really take you out of the action when you need to load a new campaign after completing one. The levels have good atmosphere, dark, spooky, but it gets old very quickly. Most every level feels the same with generic buildings, generic exteriors, generic trucks.\n\nBetween the levels are safe rooms. Leave a safe room and make it to the next safe room to cap off the level. Then at the end of the level, you see your score and how you did against the other players. Who killed the most zombies, who took the most damage. Stuff like that.\n\nTo be honest it's not that good. It feels very one dimensional. Within the first few levels, you've seen all the game has to offer. You will quickly see all of its small variety of enemies zombies run straight at you, witches that stay huddled until you put a light on them, stalkers pounce on you until you are saved, smokers use a tongue to strangle you until you are saved and explode smoke, exploders that vomit on you and tanks that can throw you and take a giant amount of punishment. You will really need to rely on others for survival. The computer players will be very willing to help you, but the players in multiplayer may not be as willing or can't when you've been left behind or gone ahead.\n\nThat's it. The game isn't very long and for a game that touts its random enemy generator, it doesn't make me want to replay the game again and again. Combat is simple, enemy variety is lacking, but the game plays very smooth. Essentially left for dead is about mowing down tons of zombies and if that's your thing, this is the game for you.

I was always curious about the franchise, but Ive never been tempted enough to actually try it out, until I heard about Uncharted 4. There was nothing about the advertisements that blew me away; I was mainly interested in it because I didn't have anything else to play. I literately forced myself to become excited about its release; and as Im sure you know, theres nothing worse than manufactured excitement. Story and cut scenes not withstanding; Uncharted 4 is really a 2 star game for me. The only reason Im bumping it up to 3 stars is because of how incredible the story was. There are going to be things said in this review that may make some of you uncomfortable, but I couldn't care less. Im fairly certain that some (many) people assigned this game 5 stars before they even played it; but thats how the fanboy machine usually works. The last couple of chapters were pretty good, but unfortunately, Id already made my mind up. In other words; too little, too late\n\n[Combat]\nThis is awkward I guess this is supposed to be a 3rd person shooter, but its hard to tell. You see, when you spend most of your time looking at cut-scenes, climbing, swinging on ropes, climbing, climbing, climbing, and you guessed it, more climbing; that doesnt leave much room for actual combat, now does it? The little combat that I did partake in wasn't very good, in my opinion. I often preferred to just charge in on enemies and kill them with my fist, as opposed to using my guns. Im sorry, but the gunplay just wasn't fun, and Im thinking it wasn't fun because it rarely occurred, and I never truly got into a rhythm. The one good thing regarding combat is you rarely fight alone. More often than not, youll have an ally by your side, and Ive always appreciated that approach.\n\n[Weaponry]\nThis is supposed to be an action game, right? In most of the action games Ive played; you're able to upgrade your weapons, and you will usually unlock more as you go. Not in Uncharted 4!!! Not only can you not upgrade a weapon, but you will not be able to carry your favorite weapon from chapter to chapter. In a perfect world, I would have been able to carry a couple of guns that I liked, and upgrade them throughout the game. Nope, Uncharted 4 prefers for you to pick up random guns as you go, and too bad if you get stuck with a gun that you hate, because youll have to use it until you find another one laying on the ground or something. This game was released in 2016, right? Im asking because that sounds like something that might happen during the Sega Genesis era. My favorite weapon was probably the grenade because that was the only thing worth using. It would have been nice of them to throw in a melee weapon or two.\n\n[Enemies]\nSo, heres what we have here. On the rare occasion that you do encounter an enemy (and I mean rare), theres usually a ton of them, and they're all armed. It reminds me of the Batman games except for the fact that Batman has this little thing called detective vision, which allows him to see all of the surrounding enemies, no matter where hes standing. As Im sure you know, Nathan has no such power, so youll have to rely on marking your enemies, which is even more annoying than it sounds. The bad guys are armed with grenades, sniper rifles, missile launchers, tanks, protective gear; etc. While at times; you're armed with  a freaking handgun. Yep, that sounds like a 5 star game to me. Im very proud to say I deducted a full star because of the God awful boss battles. Come on guys, what are we doing? The boss battles are pretty much scripted, and thats a shame because I simply adore one of the villains, and I would have LOVED to face off against this person in a legit confrontation, but Uncharted 4 wasn't having any of that. The final boss was a little better, but not really. Im sorry guys, but I don't really have anything positive about the bad guys.\n\n[Miscellaneous]\nWhat do you guys want me to say? There are artifacts to collect, but why bother? Sure, the game is beautiful at times, but without a map, I wasn't comfortable looking for collectables. I tried out the multiplayer a few times, and its not really worth the trouble. As for length of the game; there are 22 chapters, and I probably spent close to an hour on each chapter. Most of my time was spent running around trying to decide which building I needed to climb, or what I needed to do in order to get to the other side of the mountain. Would you like an example? Of course you would! Nathan approaches a door, and when he tries to open said door, its either locked or blocked from the other side. Now, our lovable hero must find another way in, which usually means running in circles, looking for something to climb. There are a few puzzles, but none of them are clever enough to mention.\n\nUncharted 4 is not only the worst action game Ive played on the PS4, but its flirting with being the worst action game Ive ever played; regardless of the console. If were talking story; then its an elite game. However, I don't play games for the story, I play them because of the gameplay. I came close to trading it in on multiple occasions, and I kept asking myself when will I be finished with this game? When I think of 4 and 5 star games, those are games I look forward to playing each and every day; not games that Im wanting to hurry up and finish. As I said earlier, the last couple of chapters were pretty good; but too little, too late. If you're a professional rock climber; then Uncharted 4 is a dream come true for you. For everyone else; proceed with caution. Mighty No. 9; you're up next!", "summary": "Too little, too late", "unixReviewTime": 1465689600}

Super Mario Kart on the Super Nintendo assumed you as one of eight mascots of the mario world, and let you race against the computer, or with a friend. The twist, setting it apart from all the other racers in the genre, was it's Item and power-up system, letting you attack your opponents with shells, and get a boost from mushrooms, plus many more. Looking back on the game now, you will see very aged graphics on a very aged system. But sit down with it for a few minutes, and you will find the addictive gameplay that made it such a classic.\n\nMario Kart then moved to the Nintendo 64 in 1997, and replaced the flat courses of the origional with huge, lush courses to show off the hardware of nintendo's new system. Unfortunately, this upset many people because the bigger courses made winning the race more about who could best use power ups, rather than actual racing skill. Multiplayer in this game was fantastic, letting you race with three other people rather than just one.\n\nMario Kart 64 also built up on the battle mode, making it much more than just a diversion from the main game. But this game was plagued with many bugs and glitches that made the game unfair, and sometimes even unenjoyable. Mario Kart 64 was fun to play with friends, but was a little unbalanced, and had too many problems for its own good.\n\nNow comes the third outing of the Mario Kart franchise to hit nintendo consoles. Mario Kart: Double Dash!! combines the best aspects of both the games before it, but unfortunately doesn't really do much else to improve the game.\n\nGraphics-\n\nThe graphics in MKDD are crisp, smooth, and very colorful. The style of the game is very cartoonish, so those looking for a more gritty dark game will be very dissapointed. Nothing in the graphics catagory is done wrong. It has that classic mario style, but some might be somewhat concerned about how nintendo has places eyes on many of the game's inanimate objects, making it somewhat distracting to drive without feeling that you are being watched the trees... (Graphics 4/5)\n\nSound-\n\nMario and the Gang are very chatty, commenting on most of thier actions. Voice acting isn't terrible, but it might get annoying to hear those italian plumbers shout out their nintendo nonsense over and over. Some catchy themes on some of the race tracks, but nothing to get too excited about. (Sound 4/5)\n\nGameplay-\n\nThe gameplay in this game remains mostly unchanged from previous editions of mario kart. Race 3 times around a track, collecting power-ups from Item boxes scattered throuout each course, and beating your opponents. Controlling your Kart in this game has been tuned to perfection. The biggest addition to this edition of mario kart is the two-player-per kart aspect of racing. There is one driver in the front of the kart, and one in the back who handles the weapons and power-ups. This means you can hold two items at a time, and you can switch your character's places whenever at the push of a button.\n\nThis adds a strategic element while chosing your character, because you can combine any two characters in one kart. There are 20 characters in total, each with their own specialized kart. Another thing to worry about is that each \"team\" of characters has a SPECIAL item that they get randomly from any item box on the map. Each special item is different, and adds a lot to a team. The addition of a two-player-per-kart system works well and adds a lot to the game, but Mario Kart Veterans of any kind will find that playing with as two characters at once doesn't really change the gameplay that much.\n\nThe tracks you will race on are some of the best and creative courses to date, but unfortunately there are only 16, and some of them are mediocre and dull compaired to others. (Gameplay 4/5)\n\nMultiplayer-\n\nMultiplayer is the main draw of this title, and should be where you spend most of your time. WARNING: If you have no friends, do not buy this game! The two-player-per-kart lets you play co-op with a friend, but honestly, controlling your own kart is way more fun. Battle mode has unfortunately taken a step down from Mario Kart 64, because the courses to play on are boring and uninspired. Two new battle modes to play with are fun and welcomed, but just not fun on such bad battle arenas.\n\nNintendo also offers LAN play, offering up to 16 players to race, but it looks like this was thrown in at the last second, and only recommended if you actually have the resources to do it. (Multiplayer 4/5)\n\nOverall-\n\nThis game is a great addition to the Mario Kart franchise, and recommended to anyone who owns a gamecube, and is looking for a great multiplayer experience. It perfects the mario Kart formula, but it has too little tracks, and a bad battle mode, and in the end, doesn't really offer anything new.\n\nOverall, it is a great game. 4 out of 5\n\n  __________", "summary": "Fun, But Not Much Here is New...", "unixReviewTime": 1144368000}

And just as when I borrowed the controller from my Xbox 360 and used with my PC, I've done the same with the Xbox One. Except that required a cable.\n\nUntil now, that is. Microsoft had a wireless adapter for the Xbox 360 for PC, which I own, so it's only natural they had one for the PC. More specifically, Windows 10. It's works fairly straight forward. Plug in the large dongle to your PC, press the pairing button on both devices, and off you go.\n\nIt really is that simple. With Windows 10, there are no drivers, no complicated steps. Just plug-n-play, as it should be.\n\nHow is the gaming experience. It's actually exactly like it is on the Xbox itself. Which it to say, excellent. All the buttons and axis controls are smooth and responsive. Giving you the full range of control if the game of your choice.\n\nI tried a few games, such as Need for Speed and Driver via Steam Big Screen, and they all worked perfectly.\n\nOne extra item worth noting is the Xbox Button in Win10. It gives you the option of opening the \"game bar.\" This gives you quick access to Xbox Games, Recording, etc. Very convenient. Too bad it can't be configured to open Steam.\n\nOtherwise, this works exactly as you'd expect. I just wish the dongle were a bit smaller, for notebook use.

Jay Mendoza", "reviewText": "[UPDATE] Added G700 + G700s comparison photo links (see below).\n\nI've been using the G700 for home and work - first for home exclusively, then for both home *and* work, and now just for work. I was able to use it for both because of its portability, especially the BUILT-IN MEMORY - a very important feature which I'll discuss below.\n\nI got a Corsair Vengeance M95 for home to replace the G700, and I have to say quite frankly, I missed the G700. The G700 was more ergonomic - most especially with the buttons. After a month of using the Corsair, I thought I'd give the G700s a shot. I still use the G700 at work, for writing codes.\n\nWhat I Like (G700/G700s):\n(+) Hands down, highest button count mouse that is *still* very ergonomic.\n(+) Dual mode SCROLLING: free scroll or click-scroll\n(+) Dual mode: wired, or wireless\n(+) Scroll wheel TILT. It is surprising that this feature is not a standard.\n(+) Very polished software (for programming the mouse).\n(+) Wireless TRANSCEIVER. Most other wireless mice only offer a receiver (1-way).\n(+) Uses standard AA battery - which means user replaceable, and HOT-SWAP able.\n(+) Ability of keys to be used as modifier keys (CTRL, ALT, SHIFT)\n(+) Multiple simultaneous button presses.\n(+) ON-BOARD MEMORY Profiles: This feature is very, very important, for it [1] Reduces lag because [2] there is NO background service running (key binding) and, [3] there is no dependence to software which means, [4] it is usable EVERYWHERE (even on the Windows Lock Screen) and [5] increased portability.\n\nWhat I don't like:\n(-) Thick cable for wired mode - however, this means it is durable. Based on experience, durability is a good thing.\n(-) A bit expensive as of this writing (because the product is still new)\n(-) Cheesy, non-functional graphics. Personally, I prefer the G700's stealth black look.\n(-) No lighting, though understandable to improve battery life.\n(-) No weight customization - we can't have it all.\n(-) The USB transceiver and USB wire uses separate USB ports (cannot be combined like Razer Mamba).\n(-) No real, useable difference with the G700.\n(-) Still needs a mouse pad.\n\nDifferences between G700 and G700s:\n() The graphics. I personally like the G700's plainer look.\n() The top surface. Well, the feel and material looks the same, but now with the said graphics.\n() The side surface. G700s feels and looks more polished: rougher, looks tougher, and less plasticity (more metal-like)\n() The click-scroll scroll wheel. G700s has less \"click\" to it. It seems softer/easier to click-scroll. I personally prefer the G700's stronger, more pronounced clicks.\n() Scroll wheel tilt. Like the previous difference, this has a softer click for scroll tilt clicking.\n() Scroll mode selector. When selecting free-scroll, it actually feels like it is letting go of the scroll locking.

The Conduit WiFi is fun, but it can sometimes be difficult to get a good, fair match going. A glitch known as the \"wall glitch\" occassionally occurs which prevents you from entering the match until it ends. Also, hackers can create automatic rocket launchers, and the score in team deathmatch is easily hacked (a hack that I have only recently noticed).\n\nThe GOOD-\n\nAmazing graphics. I'm not going to say \"for Wii,\" because really, these wouldn't look out of place in a low-budget PS360 title. However, the artistic direction is lacking.\n\nOnline play (when it works). I've invested about 50 hours into this game so far, and that's only because the online is sooo fun. There is a great selection of maps, EXTREMELY creative weapons (the shrieker and carbonizer are my favorite), and a couple different modes to keep you occupied. It is also one of only a handful of games that utilizes Wii Speak.\n\nThe EXTRAORDINARY!-\n\nThe controls! The controls are simply the best in any console shooter to date, no doubt about it.

My wife, however, in desperation to play an RPG (note the lack of RPGs out there right now), bought it and proceeded to play. Eventually, with nothing else to do, I tried playing, with the hope that the demo hadn't properly represented the game. It does. Very well. The move to hack'n'slash is irritating and leaves me more annoyed than entertained. This is especially true since the fights are boring and simply time-consuming. At least in Origins, you could target and sit back, waiting to tactically use your special abilities. The lack of any character choice is ridiculous. Warrior, Rogue, Mage. Male/Female. Combined with the mashing combat, it reminds me of playing Gauntlet Legends years ago (Food is good!). But at least in Gauntlet you got to pick yellow, red, blue, green mage/warrior/rogue. The combat is boring and the game isn't any fun to play. The maps are narrow and simple, practically 2D. Combined with the button-mashing, it reminds me of Street Fighter, except that the special attacks are easier to do than Sonic Boom. And that is just the beginning.\n\nI could never call this an RPG. An action/adventure, but not an RPG. I've played RPGs from Wizardry I to Fallout: New Vegas and this definitely isn't one. The level up is basic and the skill tree is so linear that you never feel like you're actually picking skills, just choosing preselected ones. In Example: skill tree 1 has 6 skills. A, B, C and so forth. A and B are opposites and can't be used together. Possibly both are available to start, but more likely you can pick A at level 2, B at level 3. C requires A, but more importantly it requires you to be level 4. Level 2 A, Level 3 B, Level 4 C. You don't feel any choice in the matter. Sure, you could pick skills from different trees, but why pick several basic skills when you could level your character's specialties. Also, your character's story is even more set in place than Origins. It never feels like your own character, just the character you're playing as.\n\nTo the simplification of the game...The trend now is to simplify RPGs to invite other gamers to buy the games. A stupid idea. What FPS gamer is going to suddenly buy an 'RPG' just because it has been dumbed down? The more complex the RPG, the better. That is how RPGs work. Complex story, development, even rules. D&D hasn't survived for so long for nothing. Bioware has gone down the drain faster than Bethesda did. They probably should have just kept paying Wizards of the Coast for rights to Forgotten Realms and kept up with D&D based games. How could you pick Dragon Age over Baldur's Gate? At least Bethesda kept Oblivion playable. It was empty and devoid of anything particularly great, but somewhat fun to play. DA: Origins was a mediocre RPG with boring gameplay and mildly interesting character and plot. DA II isn't even that! It's not even an RPG.\n\nThere are other complaints like the extreme buginess and choppy gameplay. But all you really need to know, is that it isn't fun to play. Not even as an action game.", "summary": "Boring Action/Adventure (not RPG)", "unixReviewTime": 1302739200}

The game itself was so immaginative and impressive that I think some attention was lacking in designing the missions.  They're impressive, but could've been so much more.\n\n3) I couldn't pilot a single ship.  I was delegated strictly to the role of admiral/fleet-captain.  I couldn't jump into the cockpit or bridge of one of these ships, and take a hands on approach to fighting.\n\nErgo my following thoughts; there are so many positives about this game that I can't help but give it five stars.  However, if I were to make a mod or have the developers create an expansion for Homeworld, it would be to create a \"realism\" mode where players could fight over vast distances.  I'm talking millions of kilometers here; AU size strategic ranges, with perhaps tactical distances being more akin to modern BVR engagement for today's jet fighters.  I also would love to be able to have been able to pilot one of the ships, and/or man a gun turret while my AI controlled the rest of my assets.\n\nOtherwise, in terms of graphics this game is visually striking.  And I truly mean that.  Vivendi did their homework when it came to developing this game, and it was created with love and passion for the science fiction space opera genre.\n\nThe music, story and backgrounds are blended supurbly.  This is truly an impressive production, but, like I say, I had my own personal misgivings of what I wanted.  Still, my personal tastes shouldn't detract from what surely is quality game design.\n\nLike I say those are just my personal takes on what else I would have liked in this this game.  I know it's been about ten years since this game first came out, and seeing as how the whole franchise seems to have been put permanently on hiatus, the possibility of this series being revived are slim and none.  Too bad, because it deserves better.\n\nHomeworld is the space-game other corporate driven studios would have loved to have produced, but, because of their own power structures dictating their creativity, can't.  They're incapable of doing so, and when they tried tended to botch the effort.\n\nIf you haven't tried Homeworld, then do yourself a favor and buy a used copy.  Every good science fiction fan owes it to themselves.  The missions are somewhat linear, and lack what could have been a larger dynamicism, but the gameplay is respectable enough that you should be able to enjoy the story and wonderful graphics that rival today's top of the line space-sims.", "summary": "I have a love hate relationship with this game.", "unixReviewTime": 1227744000}

Each set has a mini story and character attached to it but it's nothing interesting or anything to remember. What makes WarioWare fun is the speed and timing in everything. I actually prefer this over Flash Focus (DS) since it sharpens your \"eye skills\" better than any game you could ever play.

Last season when I heard that they overhauled Triple Play Baseball and re-named it to MVP, I figured \"different name, same arcadey baseball\" and didn't even give it a try. I'm usually a fan of Acclaim's All-Star Baseball series, but this season I decided to give MVP a go mainly because of the minor league feature. You can play as any AA or AAA team and even incorporate them into your dynasty! I'm glad I did.\n All of the typical options and play modes are here (exhibition, dynasty, season, etc.) In place of the usual home-run derby, they've got a new game where two batters face off and see who can total a certain distance (usually a mile). It's a different spin and is surprisingly addictive. Of course there's also a pitching challenge where two pitchers face off and see which one can strike out a set number of batters first.\n As I said in the title to this review, atmosphere is amazing. In every other game I've played, if you hit a homer the crowd goes crazy...and then when the next better steps up to the plate, it's back to silence. Not here. When you do something to really get the crowd into it, they get into it and stay into it! When you bring your closer in for a save and you're down to the last out, you feel like you're really in a major league park!\n I was unsure about the throwing meters, but they're REALLY easy to pick up, and I really like them. No more cursor-based hitting, and to me, that's a GREAT thing. The most pleasant surprise to me is that you'll actually have 4-3, 5-3, 5-4 games. I figured that, since it's EA, it would be another year of 22-1 type scores, but they've redeemed themselves this season. The ONLY thing I don't like is that you cant warm up a pitcher when your team's batting. Other than that, this game is unmatched.", "summary": "Atmosphere is king in MVP", "unixReviewTime": 1081382400}

When I first heard about this game my initial reaction was Disney and Final Fantasy together?!  This is going to be complete crap!  However, because I'm a huge fan of Final Fantasy, I just couldn't resist buying this game and trying it out.  I just had to see for myself what all the fuss was about...\n\nGraphics (score 10/10): The graphics are excellent.  They're sort of cartoony in that everything is rounded and sort of exaggerated in proportions, but that's appropriate since most of the game involves Disney characters, which ARE cartoons.  Anyway, the art style aside, the graphics look very good.  Everything is crisp and detailed and lovely.  The only thing one might complain about is the fact that Final Fantasy characters are altered from their original art styles to fit in better with the more cartoony look of the game.  I didn't hold this against the game though since they would've stuck out like a sore thumb otherwise.\n\nMusic (score 10/10): Whether or not you enjoy the music will depend almost entirely on whether or not you liked the original film scores for several Disney movies since a lot of the music for each area is based on those songs.  I'm not a huge fan of the Disney songs, but I enjoyed them just fine.  What is unequivocally awesome, though, are the original songs.  I love the intro. song, the music in Hollow Bastien, and the music during the final boss fight.  The voice acting is very top notch as well, so this section of the review gets a perfect 10/10 score from me.\n\nCharacters (score 10/10): The main characters are pretty likable.  Sora is a bit simple-minded, but he's also fairly young (I'm not sure exactly how young), so that's understandable.  Riku really shines as a complex and interesting character who's vacillating between his friends and joining the \"dark side\", so to speak.  In fact, I found him more interesting as a quasi-villain than Ansem - the actual main villain.  Now let's talk about the side characters.  For the most part, this game is more about the Disney characters and the original characters (like Sora, Riku, Kairi, Ansem, etc.) than it is about the Final Fantasy characters.  While entire game worlds are built around the Disney characters, the Final Fantasy characters are more like cameos that pop up here and there.  Their backstories are often altered to fit in with the plot of the game (which makes perfect sense), but their core personalities remain intact and accurate.  So, despite their essentially ancillary roles, I was quite happy with all the fanservice anyway!\n\nStory (score 10/10): Well, how to sum up the story?  Um, there are these things called \"hearts\" which seem to be like souls or cosmic energy or both.  There's a bunch of talk about \"light\" and \"darkness\" and metaphors about good and evil and you get to hit people in the head with giant keys shaped like swords!  Okay, okay, I'll get serious.  You start off as protagonist Sora who lives on a small island which is suddenly engulfed in weird black mist and attacked by a bunch of monsters.  He finds a strange door and it leads him to a totally different place, where he sets out to try to find out what the flip just happened to him and how to save his home.  That's basically the beginning of the story in a nutshell.  Sora travels around to different worlds (these are small planet-shaped areas in space that are each based on a different Disney movie) in order to try to stop the monsters from overrunning everything.  I really like the story since it feels fresh and interesting.  My only complaint here is that you will hear the word \"heart\", \"light\" and \"darkness\" a little too much and it all starts to feel cheesy and heavy-handed in its message.  It doesn't detract too much though.\n\nBattle System (score 9/10): I usually don't play action RPGs because my reflexes suck and thus they are usually too hard for me (yes, I hate to admit that but it's true).  I was very pleased to find that Kingdom Hearts has a very easy to use battle system, and the difficulty level is very approachable.  This is mainly due to the fact that this game has an excellent auto-targeting system that sort of draws you inward toward whatever enemy that you are trying to hit.  The game still feels plenty challenging in parts, (the boss battle against Maleficent springs to mind) so they did a good job of making it fun yet challenging.  My only complaint has to do with your A.I. controlled party members (Donald and Goofy).  Their A.I. is laughable bad, so don't rely on them to intelligently attack an enemy or keep you healed or anything really.  Thankfully, this isn't much of an issue since you can easily handle all the enemy yourself without having to lean on them.\n\nGameplay (score 9/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  I've heard some people complain about the camera but it didn't bother me much at all.  I mean, sometimes it goes a bit wonky, but it really wasn't an issue for me.  As for the rest of the controls, this is a stunningly well-polished game.  The menu navigation is good, the pacing of the game is good, you get a good variety of weapons and items to play around with - basically it all feels good and I don't have any complaints.  Also, the game never feels too grind-intensive (grinding is NOT the fun part of RPGs), so that makes me happy too.\n\nOverall (score 10/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  Wow am I glad that I decided to pick this up.  Just think, If I'd stuck up my nose at the Disney aspect I'd have missed out on a great fun game.  So please, even if you consider yourself to be a \"mature serious gamer\" just give Kingdom Hearts a shot.

I'll even confess that I was a noob with RPGs in general, my history limited to Ultima Online in the stone age of 2D and a brief stint at World of Warcraft eons ago.  I wanted a well-rounded single-player role-playing game which didn't need a persistent internet connection or a monthly subscription to enjoy; Skyrim seemed to fit the bill.\n\nInternet is a prerequisite and so is Steam in order to install the game.  I tolerated it as, after that, a connection isn't required to play the game.  I found the set-up scenes just enough to get a vague idea as to the 'sides', and the first quest (to get the hell out of Dodge -er- *Helgen* before becoming prisoner flamb) almost enough to get a grasp of the mouse and keyboard controls before being thrown into the world.  Having a rollerball mouse made fine-tune movement a bit of a challenge for some time; I often found myself looking at the sky or getting a birds-eye view of my frantic running in circles as a wolf chewed on my arm.  Training my fingers to the WASD way took a while longer.\n\nSo, the game.  I'm enjoying it overall.  As this is the Legendary Edition with all three of the expansion packs, or DLC, there are dragons and werewolves and vampires.  Theres crafting, smithing, and cooking to go along with the killing and looting.  Hunters can prey upon the wildlife; gatherers can pluck the wings off of butterflies.  Homebodies can have buildable houses, marriageable NPCs, and adoptable children who never grow up.  Head out on the road and get distracted by all of the black icons on your compass bar (indicating an undiscovered location).  Get sucked into caves and emerge after pitched battles with vicious living trees into lakes filled with slaughterfish.  Trek across country and find booby-trapped dwemer ruins, head to the coast to the sight of shipwrecks; flee to the city to find little boys praying over mutilated corpses.  This is Forrest Gumps box of poisoned chocolates.  Its awesome.\n\nThe graphics at first blush look amazing, with lovely color, depth and grandeur.  The skies at night when the moon(s) are out are particularly breathtaking.  Most of the world does seem to be grey much of the time, whether due to snow or drizzle, but I suppose it suits the region and makes the areas with greenery all the more welcome to view.  Some textures could use improvement but I haven't bothered getting the official high-def pack or any mods.  The sound, whether providing world atmospherics or situational cues, has enough variety to avoid monotony.\n\nThe voice acting on the other hand, could use a lot more variety.  Distinctive voices crop up on several characters all over the world which gives the impression only five people did all of the NPCs.  NPC dialog loops are pretty limited as well, to the point where I go out of my way to avoid getting close to certain characters.  I still don't know the name of that kid in Whiterun, but I sure do know he works for Belethor at the General Goods Store.  I also know that the problem with Skyrim these days is that everyone is obsessed with death.  That priest of Talos won't be shouting his annoying sermons in Whiterun anymore though; and if I didn't unload a ton of loot in Riften so often, that rude Grelka would be next.\n\nSome quests can seem repetitive; bandits, necromancers, or draugr, the main issue for me is whether or not I can avoid being dog-piled to death during a dungeon crawl.  I will admit I was as staggered as my character was the first time one of the undead 'shouted' at me; and I was feeling a bit smug at that point that I had an advantage.  Not so much.\n\nThe AI for followers and enemies can be frustrating and laughable.  Yes, Foresworn, the buddy you were just talking to must have been felled by the wind.  Sure, Bandit Chief, that arrow I lodged into your eye socket is just a product of your imagination; now go back to your chair so I can take out your other eye.  Please, Lydia, stop getting in the way of my arrows, stepping on every floor trap switch, or charging into battle when I'm trying to stay hidden.  Not saying 'ow' at every turn in your snotty voice would also be welcome.\n\nTo be fair, Lydia really doesn't match my play-style, which is sneak and snipe.  I also like to climb mountains to get to my goal; Lydia (or any follower really) doesn't jump upwards and I get a few hours of peace before she catches up to me.  I know I can dismiss Lydia, but I'll admit that, as decoy, she has her uses in some fights.  Still, I infinitely prefer Serana, despite her habit of necro-ing the recently deceased before I get the chance to loot, as she's not only a powerful magic-user (an area I'm lacking) but favors ranged attacks and doesn't insist on putting herself in front of me and my drawn bow.  Her voice is also more pleasant.\n\nThen there are the bugs and quirks.  I hadn't played above a few hours when I saw the first mammoth drop from the sky.  Since then, elk have been raptured, bears have been abducted then dumped back to Skyrim (they bounced too).  Fast travel to cities seems to be an open invitation to vampires to slaughter innocent (and critical) NPCs before being put down.  Fighting while mounted on a horse is a hopeless enterprise.  I've also experienced the silent crash-to-desktop three times in the month I've played this game.  Reloading and approaching an area from a different angle seems to work for some locations, but I haven't been able to get to Redwater Den yet.  Lydia vanished during a giant-mammoth-dragon battle.  I'm pretty sure she hadn't been launched into space by a giant club (I've both seen it and experienced it; it's pretty hilarious).  About a game-week later, I shot at a figure approaching me out in the wilds with weapon drawn; turned out it was Lydia.  D@mn it.  One of the quests (Blood on the Ice) needed several reloads to advance properly; I hope no others are similarly borked.\n\nAnd, the quests.  I'd dearly love the option to drop quests, or at least hide them, in my journal when I have no intention of completing them (no, sorry, I'm not going to cause a shipwreck) but which are foisted upon me simply because I was accosted by some stranger, looted an object from a chest, or read a book.  Completely avoiding the Thieves Guild or the Dark Brotherhood, if one wants, seems nearly impossible.  And at times I'd like more conversational options with quest-givers, such as telling narrow-minded obsessives like Isran or Delphine to shove it.\n\nAll in all, I do enjoy playing Skyrim.  There is enough evidence to indicate that a lot of attention went into the look and feel of the world; the world itself is packed with new things at every turn.  I cant blind myself that there are flaws and faults, some potentially game-breaking.  But it is satisfying when I craft my own armor, or make ever more-powerful enchantments and potions, or manage to find another piece of a quest puzzle.\n\nAnd I still get a rush when Im creeping through the underbrush toward yet another undiscovered ruin, fort, cave, or camp and then hear the sound, see the name, and watch the icon turn white.  I now have a new location on my map.  And I smile as I begin to evaluate who or what might be occupying said location, calculating what the body count will be (including wondering if my own will be one of them), and guessing what sort of loot I might acquire if I manage to make it through as I maneuver myself to a good position and ready my weapons to begin the attack.  And then I save my game before I take the first shot, because Im a sissy.", "summary": "Enjoyable but uneven", "unixReviewTime": 1398297600}

You can only come back to a previous level after leaving by finding the start point of that level NOT MARKED ON YOUR MAP. Why? This is maddening.\n4. Did I mention the map ENTIRELY SUCKS?!?!?!?\n& finally my last complaint & what I think is an absolute cardinal sin:\n5. If you have established rules based on play style criteria & do not adhere to them depending upon the level- that's not funny. That's stupid and absolutely cruel to the person that paid hard-earned money to be immersed within the world you created. For the uninitiated, let me explain as simply as possible using this example: Goal: Get the coveted \"Ghost\" rating at the end of a level. \"Ghost\" rating is only achieved by not tampering with the world in any way (ie. knocking out guards, picking locks, blowing out candles, generally disturbing the environment). The problem is that the developer constantly changes the criteria depending on the level. Some levels, \"Sure, go ahead and pick all the locks, but don't knock anyone out\" while other levels, \"Don't pick any locks or blow out too many candles, but go ahead and knock out a few baddies.\" Still this wouldn't be so bad if the criteria was mentioned before the level began (better still, if they had set one type of play style and stuck to it), but there is NO MENTION of it whatsoever. One can spend hours on a level being as stealthy as possible, end it immaculately and still get smacked with a garbage rating, because the developer changed the rules. It's maddening and I find myself going to YouTube to see how other people achieved the coveted rating by generally digging deep into the percentage systems per level to find what was and was not allowable. I shouldn't have to watch a YouTube video for this reason. If it's to watch an experienced player with amazing skill get through a super hard boss- fine, but in the case of Thief- no.\nAll in all, this may sound like I really did not enjoy Thief, but the opposite is true and I really hope the developer takes a look at these criticisms. I love this game and this series and really want it to continue, because when it's good, you really do feel like a master thief!", "summary": "Go deep? Get Frustrated. Play Casual?

The story, the characters, and the universe as a whole are all fantastic. Possibly some of the best science fiction written in any media.\n\nThat being said I did have some issues with the game play MEII versus the first one. I feel like they stripped away many of the enjoyable RPG elements of the first game to make the second one more like an FPS with RPG elements. I really enjoyed all the various weapons and armor of the first game and the customizing that was possible. Also I liked the wider variety of skills (both tech and biotics) and did not enjoy that many (versus some from the first game) biotics were limited by what class you played. Also the resource collecting was a complete drag. I would much rather be piloting the ground vehicle looking for resources then just scanning planets. Also I felt like the ending was far to dependent on the resources you mined and upgrading your characters versus any real decisions you made during the game itself. Not that I minded going through the side quests for the NPC's but still it felt a little like \"play the whole game or else\" style versus true freedom to make choices.\n\nThe combat was more strealined and enjoyable but again felt a bit more like an FPS then RPG combat, an element I missed from ME1.\n\nOverall though I still really enjoyed the game. The story and the characters were very intriguing and the combat itself was appropriately difficult based on what mode you were playing through. Most importantly minus a few issues the ending felt epic and easily spoke of bigger things to come. Hopefully for MEIII they will bring back some of the RPG elements from MEI and continue the amazing story line they've already developed. Ideally I'd be happy to wait 5 to 6 months after the console version of the game comes out for them to tweak the game and make it suited for the more core PC gamers.", "summary": "A mixed sequel", "unixReviewTime": 1309910400}

Ziegler", "reviewText": "This type of product should only be for people who don't have a wireless internet connection, if you just have poor wireless due to a weak signal, or just have too much interference in your immediate area.\n\nThe construction is of decent quality.  It's made of plastic which isn't too flimsy where it will break if you were to accidentally drop it or if say a video game console falls over on it.  The USB cable is about 12 inches long which gives you a decent amount of room if you are looking to mount/place it to make your entertainment area tidy.\n\nI've tried this on a Wii, Wii U, and my PC.  This product worked okay on all three platforms.  The Wii didn't register a LAN adapter being plugged in, so it didn't give you any information about  your connection.  Some people might see that and assume that the adapter doesn't work.  I can assure you that the adapter still works even though it didn't register on the Wii.  The Wii U registered the adapter with no problems and displayed my connection info.  When connecting it to my PC, the computer recognized the adapter and was able to use it without installing additional drivers.\n\nThe performance of the adapter was about the same for each system.  I tested it by streaming videos from my Amazon Prime account.  I chose to use streaming video as my test method because it uses the most bandwidth possible on the system.  I can't remember the movie I used to test it with, but the movie had an 1080p HD option.  I also tested the quality of the video stream on my systems using the built in wireless.  The Nintendo Wii doesn't support HD resolutions so Amazon Prime didn't display any movies with the HD option.  So if you are looking to buy this product in hopes of streaming HD videos on the Wii, not going to happen.  During the movie playback the signal quality bar would occasionally drop a bar, but you wouldn't notice it while watching your video.  I had the same results with the signal quality bar on the Wii U and my PC when streaming the movie in HD or DS.  The adapter didn't have any problems handling the bandwidth required for watching HD videos.  When I tested the video streaming with wireless, I was surprised that wireless performed better than the LAN adapter.  While streaming video on HD or SD on all the platforms, the signal quality never flickered.  In my home, the wireless router is approximately 30 ft away from my devices.\n\nSo if you don't have wireless or a poor wireless connection to your Wii or Wii U, then this product would be good for you.  It is an inexpensive solution (if you don't include the shipping cost) to get your Wii and Wii U internet access.  Once you include the shipping cost (dependent on who you purchase it from), taxes (if applicable to your state), and the fact that this is just a 10/100 Mbps ethernet card, it's not worth it if you are able to get a good wireless connection.  So for a majority of people, save your $10-15 and spend it on something else.", "summary": "Not for everybody", "unixReviewTime": 1378684800}

Cochrane", "reviewText": "Devil May Cry 1 (DMC) was a really good game but was too short and it didn't have a good storyline, DMC2 was a pure deception, now Devil May Cry 3 goes back to the roots but improves every single point.\n\nGameplay: 9.5/10\n\n--------\n\nI start with the most important, the gameplay of course, DMC3 has the best fighting system, you can easily switch between 2 guns and 2 swords using L2 and R2, allowing to develop great custom combos, you can even jump on many demons and use them as a skateboard while at the same time shooting at other enemies around! You can really do crazy stuff and combine all this, it all depends on you and your imagination. Best of all, you're REWARDED for your playstyle like in DMC1 so the more you vary your moves the better your style and the more orbs you receive (which in turns increases your final score for the level)...\n\nThe game features 6 styles, 4 of them are accessible from the beginning:\n\n-Trickster: allows you to avoid walk on walls and avoid attacks easily\n\n-Swordmaster: allows you to create some devastating combos with your swords\n\n-Gunslinger: like swordmaster but with the guns\n\n-Royal guard: allows you to block enemies attacks and send their energy back to any enemy\n\nEach of those skills are upgradeable to level2 and level3, which unlocks other deadly moves. Swordmaster and Gunslinger even feature many weapon-specific moves.\n\nThe 2 other styles are Quicksilver, which allows you to slow down time, and Doppelgagner, allows you to create a copy of yourself!\n\n=> The best gameplay you could ask from an action game.\n\nLastability: 9/10\n\n-----------\n\nThis point is also very important cause you don't want to buy a $50 game if you're going to finish it within 3 hours and then don't want to play the game anymore right? Don't worry it'll take you at least 15 hours to complete the game in normal difficulty, and a lot more if you want to complete the 12 special missions, and even after you'll still want to play the game again just because the fights are a lot of fun and you want to develop and try all the 4 styles, upgrade every weapon, and you'll also unlock new difficulty levels. Wonder how powerful you are now against enemies in early missions, especially with your new moves and weapons? Try it, still too easy? Try in harder difficulty.\n\n=> For an action game, the lastability/replayability is really high.\n\nGraphics: 9/10\n\n--------\n\nGraphics are just gorgeous, real time shadows, particle effects, all this moves at 60fps and unlike DMC1 the game has many different locations.\n\nIn some rare places it's possible to cause a little slowdown if you pull an incredible move while having a lot of enemies at the screen.\n\nAlso sometimes a BIT of aliasing is visible, it really doesn't matter at all.\n\n=> One of the best looking games on the PS2\n\nSound: 9/10\n\n-----\n\nEnglish voices are great, they were already in english in the japanese version so you know you the original audio which is often the best. Soundtracks are nice, some people might complain about the Zombie music during the fights but I don't think they could find anything better, it's really adequate.\n\n=> Great sound especially if you like the genre\n\nDifficulty: 9.5/10\n\n----------\n\nThis is what many reviews complained about, including 1up and gamespot, saying the game was way too difficult, but I disagree with them. First, after you die a few times the Easy mode is unlocked so if you really see that you're not good enough then play the easy mode.\n\nThe game is unforgiveable if you don't think a little bit and try to attack non stop, you'll then get hit many times in a row and die within seconds; so try to notice when enemies are going to attack (you can usually see AND hear them preparing for an attack) and then go away/jump/double jump/roll/attack before him or block (with royal guard)...\n\nBosses fights require you to understand how to beat them too, that is, see what their weaknesses could be (they're often vulnerable after an attack etc).\n\n=> The best thing about the difficulty compared to most recent games is that DMC3 forces you to think and play well, so you actually become a better action game player.\n\nConclusion: this is the best 3rd person action game I've played on any format.", "summary": "The Devil has returned in this series", "unixReviewTime": 1112745600}

The controller is different  to the old xbox 30 because the directional pad and joysticks have a black finish.\n\nPROS:\n\n-Sleek, sexy design\n- 250 gb hard drive\n-Built in wifi\n-touch sensitive buttons\n-5 USB ports\n-Extremely quiet\n\nCONS:\n\n-glossy black finish attracts fingerprints and dust\n-no HDMi cable\n-large power adapter\n\nOverrall if you do not have an Xbox 360 be sure to pick this model.", "summary": "Excellent New Console!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1281139200}

So for starters I think you get your money's worth in playtime.\n\nIt's hard not to compare DA2 to it's previous incarnation, largely because that game got so much right and so little wrong. For example glitches like accidentally chatting up your companion during a major battle (fixed in DA2 btw) could be overlooked for the sheer tactical infinity and engaging storyline and characters of DA1. Unfortunately the comparison is not the most flattering one; as a stand alone first game this would be much better received. It's just got too much to live up to. However, if it's not broken you shouldn't fix it and these programmers chose to do that so they will be held to a higher standard.\n\nI think a meta-analysis of most of the reviews here would agree with the following:\n\n*You can preload the events of DA1 or load your custom choices which is a nice touch. This way recent history happened the way you experienced it for a more genuine feel. This is a step up over Awakenings.\n\n*The tactics, fighting, and spells are both revved up for show and dumbed down for strategy. Mage spells look brighter, rogue swings whip faster, and warrior weapons bash harder. On the other hand what you lose is any sort of tactical variety as you basically fight each battle the same. Fast.\n\n*Story lacks the stakes of the previous edition. You are not fighting to prevent the overthrow and destruction of all races by unnatural evil. You are fighting for personal gain, family and politics, which however personalized and righteous can never quite be as dandy as a good apocalyptic avoidance.\n\n*Mazes are ridiculously repetitive. I understand about cutting down on memory for good stuff, but c'mon. Throw in a random generator if you're too lazy to custom design each dungeon uniquely.\n\n*Graphics and animation are greatly improved, really enjoyable to watch cut scenes.\n\n*Party members are not charismatic or engaging, very one dimensional. Some of the walking around dialog can be quite entertaining and funny but overall I can tell you there was no Morrigan on the scene.\n\n*Items are too generic. I've got more boring amulets plus this or that than I know what to do with. Also you can custom clothe armor yourself but you're NPC's get the clothes they came in plus upgrades.\n\n*Finally, never fear, the omnivoric love is here. You can hook up with just about anyone and they'll call you beautiful even if you're buck toothed and bald.\n\nI did enjoy the game. I am giving 3 stars instead of 4 because I'm not particularly interested in a replay, the story is done and there's not going to be any alternate background or any alternate ending of interest.", "summary": "A dumbed down version of the first game but still addictive", "unixReviewTime": 1300233600}

It truly is unfortunate, though, as Ar Tonelico is a nice, solid RPG experience amidst a sea of other, less than stellar, RPGs out there. Ar Tonelico is a charming game with few flaws and a lot of good points. What's not to like?\n\nGraphics (score 7/10): It's unusual to see a PS2 game utilize 2-D graphics. However, as a stylistic choice, this game pulls it off well. The sprites are nicely detailed for being sprites, and the backgrounds are also nicely done. The dungeons are kind of bland though. The world map is a bit basic, but you really don't spend much time there.\n\nMusic (score 10/10): The music is this game is excellent--it's sufficiently varied and enjoyable. I cannot think of a single track that was jarring or irritating. The game features a number of vocal tracks; all of them are beautiful. Overall, you can tell that the game designers cared about having a quality soundtrack. The voice acting was also pretty good. Not the best I've ever heard, but certainly not the worst.\n\nCharacters (score 10/10): I think character development might be the strong point of this game, because Ar Tonelico really features a character-driven story. All the characters are likeable and have well-developed personalities, especially the Reyvateils in your party (these are your magic casters). The game features the ability to dive into the Reyvateils' subconscious and see their thoughts. This greatly contributes to their character development; and I personally found it to be fascinating.\n\nStory (score 8/10): I think the first thing to note is that the story and characters are very humorous and light-hearted throughout. Although there are serious moments, most of the game has a light-hearted feel to it; so, if that isn't your thing, you may want to steer clear. The story starts out fairly simplistically. You start out as Lyner, just as his home is attacked by viruses (monsters, not a disease). Thus, Lyner's sent to retrieve an item to help stop them. Just as the story starts to sound like a giant fetch-quest ending in the retrieval of this item, you're introduced to many endearing characters and some plot twists to keep things interesting. The story is paced nicely, and never becomes too slow or boring. I especially enjoy the branching story paths available depending on what in-game decisions you make at certain key points in the story. In fact, I think there are about 4 different endings. This greatly adds to the replay value.  The only negative point to the story is that the romantic triangle between Lyner and the female characters can come off as a bit annoying and awkward.  Other than that, though, the story is solid.\n\nBattle System (score 8/10): The battle system is your standard turn-based combat system typically found in RPGs. The thing that sets this game apart is your Reyvateil, which is your magic caster. She stays toward the back, behind your fighters. Although physically weak, they can cast powerful magic. The only drawback to this system is that winning is largely dependent on charging up song magic and then releasing it. This charging can take awhile and makes battles a bit longer than necessary in some cases. However, the system is mostly enjoyable and it really didn't bother me that much.\n\nGameplay (score 7/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me. My main complaint under this category was the incredibly small font size. Reading the dialogue is okay, but the names of the sections of towns, and a lot of in-battle text is incredibly small and difficult to read. I had to do a lot of squinting. My other complaint is the backtracking. There were a lot of story points where I had to needlessly backtrack through dungeons to see one thing, and then go back out to talk to a person, and then back again. I feel they should have at least automatically brought me to the person rather than making me walk back out. On a positive note, the grathmelding system is very nicely done. Grathmelding is a system by which you can combine multiple items to make a new item. I found the system incredibly user-friendly. For example, if you try to make an item that you're missing an ingredient for, the game automatically asks you if you want to make that item, and then it conveniently brings up the recipe for it (if you already have the recipe, of course). Kudos to the game developers; this was very thoughtful of them.\n\nOverall (score 8/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score. Given its replayability, decent graphics, excellent music, endearing characters, interesting story, and enjoyable gameplay, I don't see what's not to like about Ar Tonelico. I definitely recommend that RPG fans pick this up - even if it's a little pricey, it's certainly worth it.", "summary": "Ar Tonelico: A Relatively Unknown Game that Really Deserves More Attention!", "unixReviewTime": 1229558400}

There is still all the depth and enjoyment of the original, while adding two more characters and the next level of Kumite mode, Quest mode!  This mode is a challenging ongoing game where you make your name in every arcade in Tokyo, eventually getting to the center Arena, to become the best Virtua Fight in Japan.  Yes, it is a bit tacky, but that is not what is important.  Customizable characters get even better as a new array of items is found.  You can also get new fighting modes in the central arena, like balance and a mode where you take extra damage when you hit the floor.  The fighting moves have always been, and still are, incredibly complex and deep.  This is one of the only games I have seen that includes evasion, counterattacks, throw evades, and rolls that allow you to avoid ground attacks.  It takes a while to master, but once you get it, it is a very deep and ingenious control system.  The reviewer that gave two stars seems to be what most people are that don't like VF4: impatient.  He claims that it is too easy in quest mode, but by the time you progress throughout Tokyo, you begin to fight some fighters that are modeled after real people that are among the best VF players in the world.  They also lack the patience to go to practice sessions and explore the numerous moves available to them.  The only regretable thing to VF4 Evolution is the lack of training your own A.I., which is included in the original.  Most VF4 fans can compensate by just whipping out their old copies.  If you are new to the series and you want to play the A.I. training version, then I suggest that you buy VF4 and VF4 Evolution, they are only $20 each and are both well worth it.  Overall, I would say that VF4 Evolution is a wonderful game that makes other fighting games, with the exception of Soul Caliber 2, look just plain silly.

Grant", "reviewText": "In this installment of the Assassin's Creed franchise, you play the role of a Native American assassin named Connor for most of the game. The story takes place in the era of the American Revolutionary War in and around the northeastern United States for the most part. I've been spending a lot of time with this game since I picked it up, and have been having a great time with it. A few points of interest:\n\n1. The start. Yes, this game starts off relatively slowly, and without even playing the main character Connor. There has been a lot of talk about this aspect of the game, and I would just offer that I believe it absolutely helps to set up the rest of the game and establish the game world. It give you an opportunity to see the new graphics engine in all its glory and appreciate the great voice acting in the game.\n2. History. Great pains were taken to create a world that reflects the actual people and places of revolutionary America. Yes, there are some inaccuracies, as there are in nearly all historical fiction. But Boston in the game is based on actual 18th century maps, and the players gets to experience landmark events such as the Boston Tea Party, Bunker Hill, and the Boston Massacre. Not to mention the roster of historical figures, promienent and obscure both, that make guest appearances. There is far more to appreciate than to gripe about.\n3. Sea battles. The scope of the game world and the conflict in general is really brought to the forefront in the this new feature of the series. You take control of a ship, moving through what feels like an actual ocean with the superb ship dynamics. The tension and action in these battles is easily one of my favorite parts of the game.\n4. Movement and combat. Back on land, the parry and counter dynamics of the combat system have never looked better. Fights feel natural, look great, and are exciting. And the free running movement system as you run, jump and swing across the landscape is much improved over the previous games.\n5. Graphics. The new Anvil Next engine used in the game makes everything look amazing. I have experienced a few minor glitches and texture issues, but nothing game breaking. And I expect upcoming patches will help. I am running this game on a high-end gaming rig, though, so I cannot speak to what the experience is on other setups.\n6. Multiplayer. Wolf Pack lets you team up with other human players to take down computer controlled targets. Assassinate pits you against other human players.

So why in over 25 years when you have pc games with adult content (nudity etc) you hardly ever hear anything about it.\n\nGaming Consoles=For kids, basically considered a toy. So any adult content is automatically is met with outcry that video games are showing porn to kids. Why even M rated games are watered down where regular tv is more taboo than any console game. Like Bioware games where romance scenes are women in bras and granny panties etc.\n\nWitcher 2 I figured would be censored to the max when ported from PC to Xbox.

You ever notice when you play the first few levels, you always collect EVERY letter, balloon or the puzzle pieces as well because you just want to find them all before you complete the level? I always end up doing that and have been successful at that for a LONG time until Tropical Freeze first level was completed, I realized I was STILL missing 2 puzzle pieces! This shocked me because every single Donkey Kong Country game that I have played, I always end up successfully finding the hidden stuff in the first few levels due to wanting to explore, take my time, enjoy, etc. but when you play the first level of Tropical Freeze, I am going to bet 99% of the people do not end up finding all of the Puzzle pieces or KONG letters or both during their first time completing the level! Of course they will probably be able to find whatever they are missing the 2nd time they replay the level but I am not kidding, I honestly believe you will not find all those puzzle pieces or kong letters during you're first attempt of completing the 1st level or more levels of world 1.\n\nwhat else? well I know there is sadly, WAY too many negative nancy's that care more about the graphics than the GAME itself wanting to know if the graphics are good or whatever.  Read my words, are you kidding me!??! THIS IS DONKEY KONG COUNTRY FOLKS! OF course the graphics are going to look good, so QUIT worrying about that and focus on the more important part of the game which is the GAME itself!\n\nThe music? HOLY CRAP! If you always enjoyed Donkey Kong Country soundtracks since the first DKC game for the Super Nintendo, then you are in for a VERY special treat my fellow DKC gamer! Also, did I mention there is alot of great extras/unlockables? I won't spoil that part cause trust me, you will want to see it in person by yerself rather than cheating by watching a full playthrough of the game via youtube or whatever lol.\n\nIf you are skeptical about buying Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze, then do not worry because there is no excuse to not buy DKC Tropical Freeze since this brand new spanking game is only $49.99!!! Smart play and decision by Nintendo because I can't be the only one thinking that this game could or should of been $59.99 but that's not the case.  Also, for the record if this game was $59.99, I would of still bought it!\n\nI am absolutely SHOCKED that Nintendo did not promote the online mode for DKC tropical freeze.  I know what you are thinking, \"WAIT WHAT? DONKEY KONG COUNTRY HAS ONLINE MODE???\" Then guess what? YES! It is true! DKC tropical freeze DOES indeed have online mode.  First off, do NOT get sad about the fact that online mode does not include co-op gaming because if you really think about it, Donkey Kong Country already has co-op mode locally! Plus, I don't see myself playing a co-op game of Donkey Kong Country with some random player I don't even know.  Anyways, why did I mentioned that Donkey Kong Country tropical freeze has online mode? Well, after you complete any levels in the game, the level itself will unlock a time trial option but the best part is the fact that you can UPLOAD you're fastest completion time of whichever level via ONLINE! After you upload you're best completion time for whichever level, the game will display an online leaderboard ranking! Plus, it will show the person that is playing what they are ranked as right away!\n\nBut that's not all! Have you ever wanted to see how fast any of the levels can be beaten? Well, the online leaderboards allow the players/gamers to select ANYONE that has submitted their best times and you have the option to WATCH THE ENTIRE REPLAY of the fastest player beating any of the DKC levels! Let me tell you something, you will be SHOCKED and AMAZED on how insanely fast some of the best Donkey Kong Country players in the world can do.  It is seriously pure shocking to watch the reply, you will FULLY understand what I mean and feel after you watch you're first replay video of whichever level you want to see being completed in record times by hardcore DKC players!\n\nBefore I end this review, please do yourself a favor by purchasing Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze for the Nintendo Wii U by either buying the retail disc box version OR please visit the Wii U Eshop and download the game to you're Wii U because i promise you that Donkey Kong Country tropical freeze is a game that you can proudly have stored on you're Wii U main channel page with all of the other games/apps you may have downloaded.  I got this game as a gift via disc retail package, even though I am just a TINY bit disappointed about that because I wanted to download Tropical Freeze to my Wii U, so that I don't have to change discs if ya know what I mean hahahaha.\n\nIn conclusion, Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze is a MUST buy game for any Wii U owners that are looking for something to keep them playing for months due to how rewarding and challenging this game is compared to the Donkey Kong Country Returns Wii game back in 2010.  Were you left wanting more levels, more challenging and more rewarding feelings from completing the game/levels? Then buy Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze ASAP or you might as well just get rid of you're Wii U since you're Wii U doesn't deserved to be played if you didn't put in some DKC tropical freeze time in the Wii U.  I am not joking, if you do not play Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze on you're Wii U by the end of this month, then you should be arrested, plain and simple!\n\nCheers everyone and BUY Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze, the Wii U needs that Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze lovin! Please wear a hoodie or warm clothes when playing Tropical Freeze because you will literally start to become VERY cold when playing the snow/winter levels, trust me on this one!\n\nPeach out!\n\nps.

Mediocre -but doesn't live up to the hype due to one button combat and frustrating camera angles\n\nAssassin's Creed is clearly a visually dynamic creation.  The programmers and graphic artists are to be commended.  The cities are brilliantly rendered and are populated with numerous different types of non-player characters with whom you interact.  Jumping across rooftops in acrobatic fashion is oddly reminiscent of the Prince of Persia series, but in my opinion, done much better.  Its good, but does not live up to the hype\n\nCombat is entertaining, but simplistic.  It can be enjoyable as there are probably 50-70 different contextual combat moves depending on which weapon you are using (one of 5 available -sword, short sword, throwing knives, fist and what is bound to be everyone's favorite- the concealed blade).  However, it can be frustrating when bad camera angles frequently make it extremely difficult to fight in confined spaces.\n\nThe AI is above average, although not quite realistic.  The guards get smarter, more alert, more numerous and better at combat as you get deeper into the game.  However, after around the fourth or fifth assassination target, I began to find the missions somewhat repetitive.\n\nDifficult combat situations are easier when you manage to knock an opponent to the ground (either by grappling or combat) and you use the hidden blade.  The countermoves are not easily predictable as they are primarily rooted in the reaction to the NPCs attack rather than just what you are doing in relation to the attack.\n\nThe best parts of the game involve acrobatic movements across city rooftops, and various beams and structures, and leaping through various kiosks in order to escape from pursuing guards.  Attack (high profile) assassinations are rewarding -- jumping in the air and stabbing the NPC through the neck with your hidden blade.\n\nI initially had a glitch where the game would randomly lock up- necessitating a hard reboot of the PS3.  However, I believe the patch has fixed this problem.\n\nTo give you a frame of reference:  I would rate God of War as a 10, Grand Theft Auto as a 9, Metal Gear Solid-sons of liberty - 8.5.; Resident Evil 4 - 8; Splinter Cell double agent 8.5\n\nI would give Assassin's Creed an overall score/ Fun Factor of 7.5 out of 10.  This is primarily due to the graphic design and appeal.  Visual appeal is  10/10 - although there are a few minor ticks and issues that I would like to see improve if the game makes it to a sequel.  Combat gets a 7 of 10 -primarily due to the many varied ways to kill (although you have only limited control and one button combat (moderately doubled by squeezing R1)  However, one button combat and bad camera angles (when fighting in confined spaces) is extremely frustrating; several times bad angles in combat caused me to want to quit and play again later.  Story line - 8 of 10.  Replay factor 6 of 10.  Although I enjoyed the game, now that I have beaten the game, I would not characterize it as one I would feel immediately compelled to replay - except to try to get a few more stealth kills.", "summary": "good game but  falls short of hype", "unixReviewTime": 1197504000}

I can get why people didn't like the game due to the lack of content although it wasn't a problem for me as I'm personally going for enjoying certain cars that I want to drive and not needing to drive them all, but it would have been nice if some of the cars I did want to drive weren't paid DLC. The small amount of tracks also gets repetitive quickly especially if you race in every event in the story mode.\n\nNow that Forza 6 has come out it has pretty much corrected all of these issues: tons of cars, many more tracks, rain & night driving, better/more intense force feedback for wheel users, more events, specialty events, and much more. One thing I did like more about Forza 5 though was the Top Gear voice overs were more informative about the car classes and specific cars for the opening of each new series of races in the story mode where in Forza 6 it's just a few rushed tidbits about the cars.\n\nNow that Forza 6 is out I recommend buying it as well but Forza 5 is still worth playing, at least for the achievements and also for those die hard Motorsport fans and sim racers just to have a new story and goals to progress towards and also for someone who is new to the Forza Motorsport series and might just want to try it out by getting the older, cheaper game. I personally never really got into Forza Horizon 2 however I've put hundreds of hours into this game, even though it isn't perfect (and Forza 6 is so much better) what this game did get right were the graphics and pretty good racing physics which allowed me to have lots of fun with my Thrustmaster wheel setup and sparked an interest to want to go a lot further into the world of sim racing.", "summary": "Definitely Worth a Try", "unixReviewTime": 1451520000}

This game works very well with the Kinect, and takes a lot of practice to tell your brain your left arm goes up and down, and your right arm goes left and right). I've played it for a couple of hours, and honestly is the best reason to buy this game. A stand alone XBLA title which may be slightly more elaborate would be great IMO.\nStar Hop works well, and you'll probably have fun with this for 30 minutes or so until the novelty wears off.\n\nCons:\nshort games\nannoying music\nleft and right conrols for Robo Drive\nbalancing board  game which requires one arm\nSack Hack (also having to use designated limb or head to keep balancing sacks with poor 3-D motion detection)\nCrank It Up\nDodge Ball, which is an inferior version of the Kinect Adventures version.\n\nOverall, this has 2 fun motion games, and the rest are boring, but that's just an opinion.

I would complain about the fact you have to connect this to the web even to play the single missions, but most programs are forcing this issue today with all the validation concerns, so I roll with it for now.  The single missions and cuts scenes are great, heads above those of the new Zerg expansion.  Through some sort of playing through the eyes of something, you get to play with the protoss units a bit.  The sound and graphics are all great and tunable for the different speed graphic cards and computers.  You can tone it down if you lack power, and crank it up if you have an Alienware machine like I run.\n\nThe new game has earned levels where you can choose your tech from two choices, and once set each choice at a given level cannot be revoked.  This gives the game added playability as you can redo the missions on one of four difficulty levels and change the tech from all defensive to all offensive or a combination of both.  Sometimes you get different units when you do this, sometimes you get better firepower, or more armor etc.  The game as units that acquire ranks the more they kill, but I don't think, or cannot tell if that experience makes them tougher, it doesn't seem like their stats get higher.  It would have been nice if you had veteran units that would be twice as hard to kill because of experience, but maybe that's something for down the road implementation by Blizzard the ranks is the first step.  I have one complaint about the game, and I'm not sure this happened in a recent expansion or was always there.  You can't click on a crystal anymore and find out how much is left, nor can you click on an enemy unit and find out its expansion level and hp.  You could always do that with SC1 and I liked the feature, they should bring it back.\n\nIn the new multiplayer they still have a map editor that people have created a lot of very good games, some of them even more fun that the original if you are so inclined.  Playing the AI is more fun to have you have several setting of difficulty now you can set the AI too and it does a nice job of playing at that level.

Although fun, every single one of the games has almost the identical hand movement - whether underhand or overhand, you are always moving the Wii remote with the same motion.  After playing with my son for about 30 min, I had to take a break and my wrist still aches tonight.\n\nThe games are pretty good - although some of them are pretty finicky with a fine line between throwing too hard and too soft.  Lawn darts (and I assume horse shoes, which we haven't tried yet) is hard to judge as the dart goes up off the screen and then hits - you just have to guess how hard to throw until you get it right.  Skiball seems almost too easy - I just threw the ball as often as I could with a nice, straight motion and I could regularly score above 1000 (which I can't do in real life).  The football, toss on the other hand, was almost impossible - at least the first time around.\n\nSo for $20, this is probably a good value.  Lots of different games, multi-player tournament mode, and the ability to play for tickets to buy more characterization tools are all bonuses.  Just be careful how much you play.  In my opinion, no matter how touchey the controls or how difficult the game at the onset, it isn't anything that you can't improve on to the point that the game can be quite enjoyable.

At first, the racing seemed pretty dull and slow, but as you gradually gain money, you can buy faster cars and once you have some of the faster cars that can do around 250mph, the game become a lot more interesting.\n\nThe controls are pretty standard, left, right pad to steer, a and b for accelerator and brake, and just about any other button for nitro. There are a few tracks to choose from, both one way and in reverse, like a lot of racing games, however, if you go through the championship, you get very tired of the same tracks all the time. It could have used a few more.\n\nSome how this game kind of reminds me of Rad Racer (NES) and those arcade games of the 80's that where like that one. Only the graphics are now 3Dish and more is involved. Prior to this, I had not played too many games involving racing, as I thought the DS was not capable of a decent racing game besides Mario Kart after playing such titles as Transformers and Monster Trucks and it's clones. However, I was quite surprised at how well this game has been put together.\n\nIt could definitely use some improvements for option wise and extras, but as far as a racing game goes that's more lenient to the realistic side of racing, this one is up there in my top 5 racing games on DS. It may be a completely different style to say Mario Kart and Ridge Racer, but it's worthy of playing a few more times even after you have finished the challenges and unlocked all the bonus cars.\n\nThe only thing I really hated about this game was the selection of music. I think I hate every single song on here, I selected to not hear music during the race, but if only I could stop the menu music with this god awful song that's lyrics sounds like, \"they're talking us down, they've ruined our smell\" - Who the hell gave Moby a record contract?\nBut that's a personal preference, you may enjoy the irritating tunes.", "summary": "Not a bad little game", "unixReviewTime": 1241827200}

I'm even more impressed that the game sounds as good as it does despite the Megadrive's lackluster sound chip.\n\nThe only problem I guess I have is how short the game is, around 10 stages and most stages take only 5-7ish minutes to complete tops. I do however, like that the game isn't exceptionally brutal on the difficulty like other Disney/Virgin Interactive games(namely Lion King, screw that stampede stage).\n\nKinda sad that Virgin Interactive went defunct in 2003, whenever they worked with Disney they always managed at the very least a good game. Sadly, the last few games they released were absolute tosh and despite helping Capcom with Dino Crisis and Resident Evil 3 Nemesis, they just couldn't stay afloat.\n\nAnyway, I highly reccomend you to at least try the Jungle Book out, hell you can get it for all of 4$ on Amazon.

I liked some of the other modes where you can battle against another monster in a one-on-one battle, or tou have a destruction mode where you battle to see who can earn the most points by destroying the city before the timer runs out.\n\nThe controls I though were a bit too loose.  I'ts not easy pulling off some of the more complicated moves and thus you end up doing just a lot of kicking and punching which gets boring after awhile.

When I do have some time, I try to play casual, faster paced games. On the 3DS, side scrollers are preferable, since sometimes I only have a little bit of time to play a few levels before I go on with my day. Besides time constraints, I have to say that when it comes to Nintendo side scrollers mostly Mario related, I've been bored more often than not. Besides the Mario Galaxy series, mario sidescrollers on the wii, wii u, and 3DS (with the exception of Mario Maker) to me have felt bland, repetitive, rehashed, and mostly give me an overwhelming feeling of been there done that. I had always planned on buying this game due to the great reviews and my Love of DOnkey Kong Country, but I was not to keen on spending $30 plus on a new or used copy. But since the announcement of the Nintendo Selects, for $20 bucks I thought it was the best time to buy. Now having played this game, I have to say that I HAD NO IDEA that a nintendo side scroller could be this great again.\n\nBesides the whole Donkey Kong/Diddy Kong gameplay dynamic which works very well, the actual gameplay, levels, environmental triggers, and difficulty variances between levels is amazing. Each world has its own theme which is usually the case with typical nintendo Mario/Donkey Kong Games. But what has had me so impressed are the tiny differences, originality, and uniqueness of each level within those worlds. Each level has a title, you know to describe what the levels about. I'm used to general titles that go with the theme of the world but I don't expect that they actually mean anything. But each level does its best to differentiate itself from the previous and tries to become memorable. Starting with 1-4 Sunset shore, you no longer see Donkey kong but instead only see the black of his outline as a bright, lush sunset appears behind in the background. Every item and character are dark shadows of their typical colorful self, and it keeps you on your toes to know whats going on. Thats one example. Since then (I haven't finished the game but Im close) I've had an octopus try to destroy my platforms in 2-5, tidal waves try to kill me in 2-7, Barrel shoot between pirate ships in Mast Blast 3-3, and so on just to name a few. There have been such a difference in each level that I find it refreshing, and as an adult who plays as a past time but has lost the interest I once had for video games, this game definitely takes me back.\n\nBesides the variance in gamplay, I have come to respect the game when it comes to the different degrees of difficulty between all the levels. While some levels may be straight forward, finding jigsaw pieces (unlocks bonuses and also takes me back to Banjo-Kazooie!) may not be, and some are so well hidden and require such specific triggers that I would have never been able to find them without help from Squawks the Parrot in game. There is also time run which I thought would have been easy, but some of the times to reach are difficult to get gold in. I've had to play levels over, and over, to be able to get the Gold. A nice added feature. And although the bosses are quite interesting, they aren't quite difficult to beat. No, the levels that have driven me insane have been the secret courses that open only once you beat all the levels on a world. I have played hard side scrollers before, and I always appreciate a good challenge. But those Secret Courses have not only pushed my patience but have cost me countless lives. But as frustrated as I become, its quite satisfying to beat those levels at the end. Definitely pushes my skills to the limits at times.\n\nIn the end, I have a new found respect for the Donkey Kong Side Scroller, and would definitely be willing to pay $35 plus dollars to play a sequel. Whereas other games just sit around until I play them, I make sure to find time, even if its just 10-15 min a day to play my current favorite 3DS game.

Hideki Kamiya, the creator of Devil May Cry, has officially buried old Dante with this beautiful witch vixen by the name of Bayonetta.\n\nBayonetta's gameplay is hands down the best in the genre. The framerate--at least on the Xbox 360 version--is buttery smooth. The combat is deep, engaging, and totally rewarding. Not only can you chain such incredible moves, but there's just so much nuanced depth to the combat system; you'll constantly be learning new things when playing Bayonetta. I have never experienced such elegance in a combat system. I've played them all, including Ninja Gaiden, Devil May Cry, God of War, etc., and Bayonetta takes the cake and eats it all up. This one's that darn good.\n\nThe graphics are colorful, crisp, and overall just very pleasing to the eyes. The levels can be really imaginative and detailed. Bosses are huge and animate wonderfully. Bayonetta also animates beautifully as she's pulling off a ton of cool moves to take out her foes. It all looks and performs admirably on the Xbox 360 hardware.\n\nThe story is 100% insane. Not only is it cheesy, but it's also heartwarming at moments. There's some really likable characters on display in Bayonetta.

I almost always have problems putting things together and this was no exception.  Difference being that this time it was all my fault.  The instructions were very easy to follow and the only time I had a problem was when I tried to do things without looking at them.  Honestly, someone with average skills could probably put it together without instructions.  It feels quite sturdy and is level.\n\nIf I had any negative comment it would be that it is a little too low for me.\n\n2.  Dongle for the drums and the guitar.  One great thing, IMO, is that the drum dongle has two USB connectors built into it so you get a free hub.\n3.  Microphone with a long cord.  Works much better than the crappy headset I had been using.  Still hard to get star power though.  Maybe I just don't know how to  do it right.\n4.  Drum sticks, pretty plain.\n5.  Guitar.  I think someone people seemed to think it came with the Gene Simmons axe.  The guitar that came with it is quite nice.  I especially liked it because I had a really old GH III: LOR guitar.  The new one seems to be much more responsive and quiet.  I actually beat two songs on RB3 that I had been struggling with.  Guitar comes with strap and batteries, always nice.\n6.  GH: WOR.  Since I already have the game I will trade in for a cool 9.70\n7.  Drums.  It seems to me the pads are pretty quiet when you hit them correctly.  The cymbals work well for me too.  3 pads, 2 cymbals and a kick thingy.\n8.  Nice controller that attaches to the front of the drums. I like that it may be detached.\n\nPrice if you bought this stuff separate:\n\nGame:  19.20\nDrums:  Somewhere around 100 bucks\nMicrophone: 20\nGuitar Hero 5 guitar: 45\n\nSo you can see that you save quite a bit of money buying the bundle.  I was going to buy the Mad Catz Pro Drum set back when it was 130 but then it jumped up to over 200 so I found this one.

Unfortunately EA sports has not made any improvements to the game, but they have also ruined it by trying to make it more realistic(!). I'm not complaining because I can't win ,I just won my season one championship last week so I know how to play. The point is that FIFA 14 is not fun anymore...\n\nWhat EA has failed to understand is that video games are meant to be fun. when you attempt to make a game realistic (in your own thoughts), you should consider the fact that it must not spoil the fun. As you can read in other reviews there are many many many issues that happen way too often in a game which makes you want to break your game. Just to mention a few:\n\n- super sluggish game-play and increased momentum of players\n- Easy cross and header goals that happen way too much in every game (Trust me, I also score most of my goals this way)\n- Dribbling with the best players in the world is almost impossible because of super late reactions and movements\n- Lofted through balls (which was so bad in the beginning that EA released a patch to fix it in the first few weeks)\n- Unrealistic first touch controls (sometimes players like Messi seem to have no idea how to stop an easy pass)\n- Ridiculously foolish team-mates (some things are totally out of your control...)\n- Forwards are in offside position 90% of the time (and don't seem to care at all!)\n_ Throw-ins are just a joke! Players spend most of the time running after the ball themselves as if there's no one out there\n\nOverall, after a game (specially at higher levels) you don't feel like you won the game because you're good. Instead you feel like you only won because you were lucky. That's what kills the fun in a sports game.\n\nAfter all, it's EA and they sure know how to be the winner of \"Worst Company of the Year\" for 2 years in a row.

Map is much larger.\n- Car handling seems ok but either very slick or very sluggish.\n- The \"open world\" concept is much different. You have the choice to do any race for each specific car you find, but YOU must go out into the world and find them yourself, which I have not decided whether is better or worse, but just different for now. Since each car has specific races associated with that car only, if there are cars you absolutely hate, you will NOT be able to enjoy those races. This is not a new issue; HP had the same limitation.\n+ \"Most Wanted\" races are challenging but exhiliarating when you actually win.\n+ You earn \"speed points\" even if you lose a race or just driving around, which helps to get you closer to the next \"Most Wanted\" race.\n\nOverall, I have to give this game a 3.5 out of 5 for now.

They replaced a wired set I used to use, and then a wireless Logitech set I used for a few years.  So when these came up in the Vine program, I was curious how they'd compare.\n\nAs others have said, they're well packaged.  Easy to get everything out, and comes with pretty much everything you'd need.  I like the design of the base that plugs into the Xbox One controller.  It's unobtrusive, and very easy to use.  I also like that the MUTE button lights up when it's on, so you have a good visual reminder that your voice is cut off.\n\nI've got some friends who did some headphones, I don't know if they were these specifically or some other ones, and heard them complain about the update for the controller.  I'm not sure why, it was about as painless as it could possibly be.  When you plug the adapter into the controller, it pops up a message on screen that you need to update the controller.  It tells you to plug it in with a USB cable to the Xbox One.  Granted, in this day and age you'd think they'd be able to do it over the wireless, but maybe it's a time issue, and doing it that way would take too long compared to the bandwidth they can send over the USB.  But regardless, it was simple.  Plugged it in via USB, hit OK and it ran the update.  Took a minute or so.  It then asked if I wanted to do another.  I got the second Xbox One controller, didn't know if it would need the module plugged in first or not, so tried it without the headset module, just the USB, and it updated fine.  Easy Peasy Lemon Squeezy as my 10 year old loves to say.\n\nThe sounds are good.  Not epic, you won't be seeing any audiophiles using this as their main headset, but for gaming and watching TV or movies, it's certainly more than adequate.  Good volume, good balance between everything, but I wish it automatically stopped the main sound from going out through the amp.  That way at night when I'm doing something, if I forget to power down the amp, this would prevent me from waking up my son with loud explosions in a game at midnight.\n\nHowever, I found that the signal is easily blocked.  So if someone is sitting closer to the TV between you and the console, sound is choppy and drops often.  Even if I just sit with my legs crossed and my knee is in the way, sound drops constantly.  So in my setup, my great room has a couch about 15 to 18 feet from the TV, and the Xbox is under the TV with a direct line of sight to where I sit, and I need that direct line of sight for the sound to work well.  Anything between the controller and the console, and it's like listening to an old AM station as you're going under a bridge or something.\n\nIt's alright having these powered by the controller, since I can just swap controllers out if the battery empties out, and I prefer that to dealing with charging the headphones like I do my Senheisers.  But ultimately I would've preferred a wireless solution since the cord is a bit awkward, especially since it comes out of the plug at the end at a right angle, so it' either exiting \"down\" where it can be annoying on your lap if you sit like I do in a recliner playing a game with the controller in your hands, resting on your lap, or it sticks up, where it then arches around and back down again anyway.  No matter what, you notice it's there.  The alternate cable for use with MP3 players and such is something that could be handy, but I really don't see this as a seriously used option, because between the weight of the headphones and the thickness / heft of the cable itself, these just don't seem like something I'd see a lot of people using for their phones / ipods / etc...  And right by your shoulder is the large plastic quick disconnect where the different cables plug into this, making it even less of a \"portable\" option.  But for just sitting around the house, they'd work well.\n\nSide note about the battery life, it does seem significantly less when using these.  I've been testing them at night while my 10 year old is sleeping, and the controllers die in a single (not long) session even when starting fully charged.\n\nAs I noted, the sound is good for games, movies, and TV.  Despite the weight, they are comfortable for extended wear.  When I was testing things out I played about 6 hours straight of Tomb Raider on the Xbox One, and I didn't have any pressure points or uncomfortable moments with it on for and extended gaming session. Nor did my ears or side of my head get sweaty as I usually find on this kind of material (since I shave my head, headphones are right on skin, so usually that creates moisture).\n\nThe controls work well, and I'm glad they have them on the adapter and not dangling somewhere on the cable like so many headsets have.  Compared to my Sennheiser wireless headphones, these are noticeably heavier.  But not uncomfortably so as I noted when doing some longer gaming sessions.\n\nI only had a problem once with the mic, where I had to power everything off and back on to get it to work.  They did a very good job with it, the boom is completely bendable in any position, so you can position it exactly how you want it to be.  And the base of the plug is shaped, so it can only plug in one way, which means that it won't pivot and twist on you without you explicitly moving it because the plug can't turn in place.\n\nAll in all they do what they claim they will do, but for the price, unless they can do something to fix the \"line of sight needed or the sound is horrible\" problem, it's not worth it.", "summary": "Works, but cable is kind of awkward and drains controller batteries", "unixReviewTime": 1397260800}

Jeanclerc", "reviewText": "EA's Fight Night Round 2 does a great job of mixing simulation depth with arcade-style fun.  As a result, you can decide how in-depth you want the game to be and play it to your tastes, giving it very broad appeal.\n\nThe depth shines most during career mode, where after signing on to an upcoming fight, you get to control your prep both in and out of the ring.  For instance, you begin by picking your entourage, from trainer to cutman to even ring girl.  Each one will provide different benefits to your performance during the big event, but as any pro knows, they also cut into your take of the prize money.  You've got to budget yourself wisely or else you'll end up getting title shot with no money to hire much-needed help.  Next, it's on to training, where you select from a menu of mini-games that can boost your attributes for that fight.  It's a good idea, but the training itself isn't much fun.  Finally, you can equip your fighter with new gear to help boost his abilities even further (and to just look cool) before stepping into the ring.  You can even buy skills like new finishing punches, taunts, dances, etc.  Of course if you just want to get on to the toe-to-toe action, you can also bypass all of this prep.\n\nOnce you're in the ring, you've got an unprecedented amount of control.  The left analog stick controls your body movements while the right controls your punches.  Many of the more devastating blows are triggered by a series of right-stick movements, i.e. pushing to the right then quickly rolling down and then up for a right-handed haymaker hook.  So much was made of this punching scheme by other reviews, but I was completely frustrated by it for the first week or so.  Then, just like riding a bike, I suddenly got the timing down and now I love it.  The punch controls feel very natural and have a realistic sense of timing, i.e. they prevent you from just repeatedly hammering on your opponent like the old button-press setups too often allowed.  Blocking and defense also uses the right-stick in conjunction with one of the shoulder buttons, and is just as deep - you can block, parry, counter and also sway/duck to make an opponent miss.  And when you get him to miss, look out because he'll be wide open waiting for you to deliver the knockout blow.\n\nSpeaking of knockouts, the game adds a great touch when either you or your opponent are getting close to going down.  The screen gets tunnel-vision and action starts to move a little bit slo-mo;  the audio is muffled like you're underwater.  It's meant to simulate being punch-drunk and it works.  If you can clinch your opponent, you'll usually regain enough stamina to get back to normal, but if you time it poorly, he'll just level you as you approach.\n\nBetween the rounds, you have a set amount of time with your cutman (assuming you paid for one in your entourage).  He can work on swelling and cuts to try to keep you on your feet for the next round.  You've got complete control over what problems he fixes and what part of your face he works on.  You've got to instruct him well, because the damage in the game is very realistic, i.e. as your left eye swells more and more, you'll be much easier to hit on that side and better opponents will absolutely take advantage of this.\n\nVisually, the player models and action animations are very good.  The overall look of the game is a bit dark, especially the background environments which sometimes seem fuzzy or murky.  You're treated to slo-mo replays of the biggest hits throughout the entire fight, and they are extremely detailed - actually, possibly too detailed.  I was surprised by how bloody a lot of the action can become.  Coupled with the jiggly swagger of the ring girls, this game definitely earns the \"Teen\" rating.\n\nThe announcer is fine, with plenty of sound clips to mix in so that he doesn't get repetitive.\n\nThere are modes for quick fight, career mode and create-a-boxer.  Many current and recent pros are represented.  The create mode benefits from the same depth that EA put into the other aspects of the game, and you can create some really interesting characters.\n\nOverall, this is an exceptionally deep game - far and away the most thought ever put into a boxing game.  From the control in the ring to the mini-games in the training facility to the gear shop where you get decked out, you'll feel like you're vying for that undisputed belt.\n\nPROS\n*  Once mastered, punch control allows for great action\n*  TOns of depth with career mode and create-a-boxer\n*  Good boxer models and very smooth animations\n\nCONS\n*  Steep learning curve on punch and block controls will frustrate some\n*  Opponent AI is generally good, although most boxers will still fall victim to a \"wild man\" offensive strategy\n*  Bloody fight visuals and bikini-clad ring girls make this not the right choice for everyone's kids.", "summary": "And In This Corner, the Undisputed Champ!", "unixReviewTime": 1118102400}

I've played previous versions of Civilization, and many other world building style games, and this one takes the current crown.\nThis game is a lot like its predecessors.  You take the position of the leader of a great civilization and must build your nation into a true world power.  From its tiny beginnings as a single village (Watch where you build your first city!) to a true world power, you are in control.  You can discover new areas of the world, build your cities and infrastructure (like farming and mining to name two examples), and strike out to explore new areas of the world - all at the same time.\nThe new national leaders are much more interesting.  Do you want to conquer and explore, or are you more interested in scientific approaches?  Do you want to enter the space race or just stay on Terra Firma?  Note that the computer controlled characters have the same goals as the ones you can choose at the beginning of the game.  You can use this info to decide if you want to trade discoveries or fight.\nThe new unit hit point display allows you to see if your unit(s) are damaged, and by how much.  I really appreciated this feature.  The graphics are much improved over older editions.  The other leaders seem much more intuitive and really give you a challenge, especially early in the game.  Even if you want to discover and explore, you will, sooner or later, run into another nation that's more interested in killing you and taking what you've worked so long to build away from you.  That's where things get interesting.\nThe Multiplayer supplement disc included not only allows you to challenge other players of Civilization III online, but has even more national leaders for you to choose from.  This game is just about perfect.  The added scenario editor allows you to not only change the conditions by which you win in existing scenarios, but allows you to create whole new worlds to share with other players so that they too can explore your creation and download other's creations and see if you can beat the scenario they designed.\nBTW, there's a new add on pack that adds, believe it or not, even more world leaders to choose from, even more discoveries to make, and even more challenges for you to take on.  Try looking for the \"Conquest\" expansion pack and really have the best of the best.\nOf the World Building games, Civilization has long held the crown of leader of the pack.  This great new version of the game regains that crown for Sid Meier.  If you play games like Settlers, Pharaoh, Caesar III, Tropico, and older versions of Civilization, you owe it to yourself to check out this great new version.  Highly recommended for \"sim\" fans, and recommended for anyone who wants to see what it would be like to own the world.", "summary": "Civilization III - Three Times the Fun", "unixReviewTime": 1070150400}

First the PS3 version of the game graphically speaking is very much inferior to the PC version. I would compare the PS3 graphics to that of a low end PC. Secondly, in order to keep the frame rate somewhat stable the developers decided to cut frames of animation from NPCS, and other player characters while playing on PS3. This means that when you are running around in the world or in town and you run into other players or NPC's you will see them running looking quite strange. To put it bluntly it looks like everyone running around is Mr. Game & Watch. You get about 1/2 the frames of animation that you would normally get on the PC version and it makes the PS3 version feel a lot less smooth. Don't get me wrong however, your character still very fluid and fully animated. The developers made sure that YOUR character was fully animated and had the most graphical detail out of the entire displayable game world. The Frame rate is decent most of the time but when you get into large events with more than 5 people trying to kill monsters at the same time it does drop down below 30. If you are around more than about 8 people fighting at the same time it will only display the 4-5 closest to you at any given moment in order to keep your frame rate at least roughly above 20. The game is perfectly playable in any situation and these few differences between the two versions should only detour those players who feel they have to have the most graphically impressive and buttery smooth version of the game. If you have a PC that could only run this game on low and maybe even medium-low mix settings then the PS3 version is likely not going to be a bad alternative. If however your computer can handle the game at medium or medium high / high settings then you are better off getting it for PC.\n\nThe rest of the game is identical to every other review out there so go and read those for a description of the product itself.

Had it been a game for $30+, I would not have seen the same value but I think I paid like $10.  If I had paid more, like what a normal game costs when its new, I probably would have given this maybe 3 stars, maybe 2.5 if that were possible. But at $10 it's a great value so 4 stars.\n\nI got a little confused at first because I was expecting for this to be setup sort of like Company of Heroes in which you can choose to play for the Soviets or the Americans, but that's not how it works.  In this, it has like 18 or 19 missions (the original game in which you play just the American side has 12 or 13, then the Soviet assault is 6 more).  The expansion is already interwoven into the game though so you start witha  Soviet mission, then you do 2 American, then a Soviet, then 2 American, then a Soviet, etc.  Once I got that, I guess it made sense because you could see both sides of the war as you progressed through the missions.  The bad side is that way it plays more like a story so you don't get totally engaged as one side playing through to win.\n\nThe graphics are okay, not great but I think this game was 2006 or 2007.  I doubt these were cutting edge graphics even back, they seem to be on par with something from the early 2000's.  The voice acting is nice, Alec Baldwin has a great voice as the narrator.  The camera takes a little getting used to especially before each mission section because it kind of flies you all over the place, but you can get used to that.\n\nI was a little dissapointed because there aren't seperate skirmish type missions as in other RTS games like Company of Heroes or Empire Earth, Age of Empires, etc.  Sure, you can replay the main missions but you've already gone thru that so that didn't seem very exciting for me.  So the game goes pretty fast I think, but as I say if you can get it for $10 or less, it's very well worth it.", "summary": "Good Fun for a While", "unixReviewTime": 1317772800}

But, since I played and enjoyed War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron, I figured I should do my due diligence and play Rise of the Dark Spark as well.\n\nCombat -- As expected, this is primarily a third person shooter (a very under-explored genre in my opinion). I say 'primarily' a shooter because you'll be able to melee attack enemies if you wish. Every Autobot and Decepticon has their own unique special attack that can be utilized in the heat of battle to bail you out of a sticky situation. My favorite special attack was probably Drift's dashing sword attack that sliced up anyone in his vicinity (yep, it's as cool as it sounds). You'll be able to use a different character for each chapter, (goes back and forth between Autobots and Decepticons) for the most part. This can be good and bad. It's good because it keep things fresh and you learn how to play as a different character. However, I would like to have the option to select who I wanted to play as. If I can be honest, I wasn't interested in playing as some of the characters. During some of the chapters, you'll have one or two allies that will aid you in combat (don't worry, they more than hold their own).\n\nWeaponry -- For the most part, it's the same ole guns from the previous games. I think I may have noticed two or three new guns, and that's not nearly enough. Come on guys, get a little creative and give us a roster of ALL new guns, instead of recycling the same damn guns over and over. Luckily, one of the new guns became my weapon of choice. It shot out pink laser beams that covered the target in pink plasma that eventually led to their demise. I'll give the developers cool points for at least changing how the weapon upgrade system works. After leveling your character up or meeting a predetermined criteria, you'll earn a 'gear box' that contains new weapons (I use the word 'new' loosely) and upgrades. You'll also be able to equip little gadgets such as bombs and battles drones that aid you in battle.\n\nEnemies -- There's  a pretty decent enemy variety, especially for a third person shooter. You'll encounter foot soldiers, mechanical insects (Insecticons), snipers, airborne enemies, and even a few titans. The titans are cool because some of them are indestructible, and your best defense is to haul ass! I was very, very disappointed in the boss battles. Perhaps I'm suffering from Lords of the Fallen hangover (incredible bosses). I believe there may have been a total of 4 boss battles, and they were all pretty underwhelming; especially the final one. Folks, I'm talking about a franchise that had Trypticon and Bruticus as final bosses in the previous games, so I expect a little more.\n\nMiscellaneous -- Some of the environments are a bit bland, and there's not much to explore, but I've come to expect that from a Transformers' game. There are not any side-missions per se, but each chapter presents you with a list of optional objectives to meet. I was surprised at how short the game was. It usually takes me about 1 month to finish a game, but I finished this in two weeks. I'd estimate it's around 10 - 12 hours long. There is a multiplayer component, but I didn't try it.\n\nI liked Rise of the Dark Spark, but I by no means loved it. Overall, it was a fun game, but it suffered from inadequate boss battles and a short campaign.

Still, when the multiplayer demo for this game hit Xbox Live, I went ahead and put my trial Gold membership to use and gave it a go-around. I'm incredibly glad I did.\n\nYes, the single player campaign is short. On the other hand, it's by far one of the best single player FPS experiences I've had in a long time. The varied gameplay will keep you hooked through the entire campaign. Of course, there's less campaign to keep you hooked, but it's a matter of quality vs quantity for me.\n\nPlease Note: as has been stated previously, you're paying $60 for a multiplayer game. Playing the demo really did convince me that it would be money well spent. I enjoy the fact that, in non-ranked matches, you can level up even if you aren't exactly a top tier FPS veteran. While bonuses are given when you do well, nothing is taken away when you do poorly - you simply receive less xp. This was a big deal for me, as part of the draw for the multiplayer component is the slew of unlockable content that is level dependent.\n\nWhile damage regeneration is a factor, it isn't overpowering. The ease at which even a moderate player can take down an opponent more than makes up for this.\n\nFOR LEFT-HANDED GAMERS: I have a modded controller, which has both the thumbsticks and underlying buttons flipped. Because of this, I don't know whether or not the thumbstick buttons can be flipped along with the movement and aim controls.

There are so many plots and storylines and some are so far out there that i could't reall understand the whole thing. I still think part 1 was the best. The way this game ends makes you question if there will be a part 3. I hope so because i'm left hanging with a lot of questions. The scenery was great, mostly neighborhoods that were run down and rainy and winter or underground. The controls were cool but sometimes the camera angle got in your way when you are trying to fight someone. Unlike part 1, you can die in this one and i died at least 30 times but the game automatically saves b4 that is possible so you can try and try again. There were funny parts as well but i found this game more terrifying than part 1 lol. Some may find that as a good thing, for me i prefer more adventure safe game :) Overall i was eager to play it everyday after work so I still enjoyed it. the story though was too complicated for me lol so now im trying to find forums where it's explained better for me. If you you didn't play part 1, play that first or 2nd it's far better (but shorter). This game was surprisingly longer than part 1 which is good, i finished part 1 in a week this one took me a few weeks to finish and puzzles were fun to play.\nBE CARFUL: I bought this game for my PC which is the same pc i played part 1 on, and it is not compatible so i had to buy the XBOX version and borrow an XBOX from a friend. Now i got this brand new PC game that i cant play.

With the smash success of classics like Guitar Hero III: Legends Of Rock, and the amazing gameplay of Rock Band, which takes great classics like Bon Jovi's Wanted Dead Or Alive, into the beat of your own guitar rifts, it is hard to find a game that can be beat. But, that sadly, hasn't been shown as well with Dance Dance Revolution, the orignal music dance game. While it has faired well, it just hasn't been able to really keep up the pace of gameplay. Now, a new spin will try to make Dance Dance Revolution more appealing to a younger audience, but is it just a rhythm or 2 left feet?\n\nDance Dance Revolution: Disney Channel Edition for the Playstation 2, takes the DDR gamble, and brings in the appeal to a younger audience by using songs from Disney Channel staples you can dance your way to. You get songs from hits like Hannah Montana, Kim Possible, That's So Raven, and their made for TV movies like The Cheetah Girls and especially High School Musical. The graphics fair well, as you step each and every way to the beat of the songs, but the gameplay misses out for die hard older fanatics of the game franchise. The feeling of the game feels a bit old, and doesn't measure to choosing songs from classics like Cars or other movies.\n\nAll in all, Dance Dance Revolution: Disney Channel Edition is good for young fans of these Disney Channel shows, and those who think Miley Cyrus is hot, but misses the rhythm of the dance floor for veterans.

Every other RPG developer should take note of the successes by CD Projekt Red with The Witcher II.\n\nPositives:\n\n- Excellent Story, Well Realized Characters - While other role-playing games can often suffer due to being developed on lower budgets, The Witcher II is a grand title with stellar production values. The story is well-told and keeps the player involved. The characters are well voiced, interesting, and just well done all around. This is a story for more mature players. CD Projekt Red didn't pull any punches with this one.\n\n- Gorgeous Art Direction, Stunning Technical Graphics - The Witcher II is no doubt a showpiece for the Xbox 360. Not only is the the art among the best, but it's technically a masterful experience in terms of graphics. The graphics are detailed, including nicely rendered characters and environments, well done texture detail, stunning lighting, and it goes on and on. And like I said earlier, the art is absolutely wonderful and only lends to the beauty of this title. The world of The Witcher II feels like a living and breathing place packed with detail. Just make sure to install both discs to the Xbox 360's hard drive to get the best performance.\n\n- Hardly Any Recycled Assets - The Witcher II doesn't use many recycled assets in the game world. There is a lot of variety to the texture work, NPC models, environments, etc. This world must've taken a long time to fully realize, as it's a thing of beauty and doesn't wear out its welcome.\n\n- Wonderful Gameplay - Different from The Witcher, The Witcher II goes for more simplistic gameplay, which it definitely succeeds at. Gone are the mouse-clicks in favor of a more 1:1 combat system that keeps you in the fight in a more natural way. You have weak attacks, strong attacks, and you also have an evasive roll mechanic that allows you to dodge out of harm's way. In addition to the melee combat, you have Signs, which is also known as the magic attacks. The combat menu is slick and works well. The overall UI is just so well done in The Witcher II. Leveling up has been made simpler with 3 areas for upgrades: Signs, Alchemy and Swordplay.\n\n- Top Notch Packaging - Within every copy of The Witcher II: Enhanced Edition, you'll receive the game (2 discs), the official soundtrack via disc, a double-sided map, an in-depth manual, and a quest guide all together in a cardboard slipcover.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- The Witcher II still has some rough edges, but the edges are getting closer and closer to straight as an arrow. This feels like a top notch production from a AAA studio, so even its flaws are very minor.\n\nThe Witcher II is a compelling and rewarding role-playing adventure that'll immerse you in a grand world, with delightful characters and an overarching story. If you're searching for a role-playing game that is of high quality, you need not look any further, The Witcher II is for you.", "summary": "The Witcher II - RPG Excellence", "unixReviewTime": 1334707200}

There's too much of it and not enough time to waste reading about it.\n\nPros:\n\nKick-ass action.  The hand-to-hand-combat is terrific.  You have your left hand and your right hand with one fist a piece.  There are a lot of fun combos you can use to attack your enemies.  Grabbing makes it even more enjoyable as you grab an enemy and punch him like he's got Everlast written all over him or you can throw him against a wall and make mince meat out of him.  Not to mention the shoulder grab and multiple knee to the gut attack.  There's also the ability to guard yourself with those fisticuffs of yours.  Did I mention how much I enjoy wailing on Third Reich fockers?\n\nThe talent.  Top-notch voice over actors do a terrific job bringing the well written dialogue to life.  It's a great story as well and worthy of the Indy series.  Indy's voice is very close to Harrison Ford's.\n\nThe look and sounds.  Stunning environments and characters.  I love the designs created.  I especially liked the buildings in Istanbul (not Constantinople).  This game is very detailed yet runs flawlessly on not-so-up-to-date PCs like mine.  I enjoyed all the sound fx of the weapons.  They sounded authentic and added to the action.\n\nThe weapons.  Oh my.  The whip.  It is so much fun whippin' baddies with it.  You have plenty of guns both pistol and automatic to shoot anything with which includes sharks and alligators.\n\nThe action and adventure.  So much fun.  Every turn is an opportunity to swing off of ledges all over the place with your trusty whip.  You climb, jump, sommersault and hang onto / off of and flush against ledges way up, up in the air (acrophobics might get a tad freaked at times).  Plenty of puzzles and hidden gems abound make it more fun than a barrel of snakes (\"Why did it have to be snakes?\").\n\nGUI and controls.  Very easy to read and use and to set up.  All the settings are customable to your liking except that the game doesn't recognize extra buttons on the mouse other than the basic 3 and the wheel.  Not a big deal.\n\nCons:\n\nControl.  At times the controls can be jerky.  My main issue is the auto-controls.  The character sometimes goes in another direction than you may want.  Very annoying.\n\nCamera angles.  Frustrating.  The auto-camera turns away from you or just does its own thing and can be very disorienting in the most inconvenient of times.\n\nSecrets.  There are assumedly a lot of them but aren't easy to find with the annoying camera and the lack of a \"searching\" option.  Eh.\n\nSaving.  Biggest pain-in-the-tucchus.  You cannot save where you want.  There is only the auto-saving at the end of each section.  This really is the biggest issue I had with the game.\n\nAll in all it's super fun and more exciting than most games.

The quests in this game are way too long and boring. Sometimes they take me an hour to do because the hacking on a computer takes too long.

Having played it all the way through I can appreciate the feeling of place, whilst deploring the fairly poor voice acting and lack of much to do. Apart  from the business of trading, which is made dull by the immense distances  you must cross, the 'plot' involves ferrying things backwards and forwards  from one of the galaxy to the other, and quickly becomes boring.\nStill,  on the other hand, it's hugely atmospheric - whilst the 'plot' is a big  cliche, the feeling of flying through an alien universe is conveyed  effectively with absolutely gorgeous, state-of-the-art graphics and some  enjoyably 'epic', Jean Michel Jarre-esque synth music. The vastness of  space sets it apart from the jump-point riddled likes of the 'Star Wars'  games. You really do have to fly manually from place to place, and it takes  a long time. Despite the hushed tones with which 'Elite' is still  mentioned, 'X - Beyond the Frontier' (a transparent reference to the  'Elite' sequel, 'Frontier') is one of a handful of modern children. In  fact, if you like this kind of game, there's the old, fun 'Privateer 2',  and the older, less fun 'Battlecruiser 3000AD', and that's about it.\nThe  pace is refreshing, too - for a few days the glacial slowness of the game  is a nice change from the hectic blasting of 'Quake 3'. This kills it,  though - after a short while you realise that there isn't really much more  to the game than just flying from X with cargo Y and back again, and if  you're into combat, forget it - you can't even afford a gun until several  days of play, and you won't be able to use it until much later.

Also gathering GMP (the game's currency) might be rough at first especially if you aren't into doing the SideOPS missions. I've also heard some avid fans of the series claim that this particular entry in the series is a bit more action-packed than previous titles, but you're still more than welcome to go the full stealth approach if you like without utilizing the other new systems.\n\nOverall the game is still a very complete and enjoyable experience and I had a blast with the new buddy system and all the various trinkets and toys that you can develop at Mother Base.

Also common cards (as oppose to stickers) are purchasable via in-game coins/currency. Coins are very abundant if you participate in the Ro-Sham-Bo tournaments so you don't have to worry about not having enough cards. There is resource management involved though as you can only hold a certain amount of cards in your inventory until upgraded thus a recommend re-stalking on cards after each level. Also paint is a factor now as painting cards helps deal more damage and certain cards uses specific color of paint.\n\nBattle interface is a bit troublesome at first as there's a lot of steps involved to initiate an attack. But after a while, you grow used to it as in later levels you soon realize you have to manage your resources well in order to progress smoothly through a level or defeat a boss.\n\nTo initiate an attack you have to:\n1. Scroll/swipe through a list of cards\n2. Click Card Ready\n3. Paint the card\n4. Click Paint Ready\n5. Flick up the cards\n6. Look up at TV screen to initiate attack\n\nSome steps can be improved for faster battling, but after a while you get used to it.\nStep 1 could be simplified to have cards grouped in columns depending on type. If you take too long deciding or finding a card, an enemy can steal a random card from you\nStep 2 and especially 4 is unnecessary\nStep 3. Thought it was useless at first, but you dont' have to paint the card all the way if you can think you can defeat the enemy with less paint, thus saving your resources\nStep 5 and 6. Aside from the choosing and painting cards this could be done on the main screen, making for a great off-TV game play instead of having to use both TV and gamepad. But overall, the gameplay doesn't drag the game down as you'll get used to it after a while as it becomes second nature.\n\nCareful timing still present like in past titles as you have to hit a button at the right time to do additional attacks or block the enemy attack for half damage taken\n\nLove the visual of this game, very good presentation with the character's animations and use of paper and paint aesthetic\n\nScript is well done also, a lot of laugh-out-load (LOL) moments (Sample screenshots to follow). The plot is very generic, but the dialogue among characters us very fun, natural  and creative.

Its one of the scariest yet on the seventh generation of gaming. Released in 2008 on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Windows computers with Electronic Arts being the developers and publishers, the game puts you in the control of Isaac Clarke who boards an interstellar mining station whose entire crew has been slaughtered and reanimated into creatures known as Necromorphs. The game is played from an over-the-shoulder third person perspective which is similar to games like Resident Evil 4 on the GameCube and PlayStation 2. But don't be deceived that its just another Resident Evil 4 clone; it has a lot of originality.\n\nFor one, the game features no heads-up display and instead places all information that is relayed via holographic projections from Isaacs Resource Integration Gear (RIG) spacesuit and the weapons ammo counter is holographic. The health meter indicating Isaacs condition is integrated into Isaacs suit on the spine. The player can access the RIG at any time to view a 3D map, the inventory screen to manage items and checking your mission objectives. However, the game still progresses in real time so only access the RIG when you're certain that the room is clear of enemies in order to prevent yourself from getting harmed.\n\nBelieve it or not, shooting your enemies in the head isn't the effective way to eliminate them. Instead you must cut off the limbs of the Necromorphs to defeat them whereas shooting them anywhere else will have very little effect. There are a variety of enemies but the game revolves around shooting off their limbs which will weaken them, slow them down of even kill them. Never before in my life have I played a video game where I had to shoot off the limbs of so many monsters, I did plenty of games in the chest and head, but never the limbs. The enemies prove to be fast, deadly, scary and it is very satisfying to kill them. This game also happens to be very violent and bloody, if you're looking for a gore fest, then this is the game for you. You can even shoot off the limbs of human corpses you find laying on the ground and you can even decapitate them. I know it sounds sadistic, but its pretty fun to do this.\n\nThe weapons are surprisingly original and most of them are improvised mining tools such as a plasma cutter (for horizontal and vertical slicing), rotary saw, a hydrazine torch (also can be used as a flamethrower), a high-energy contact beam and a force cannon that emits powerful shock waves. The only firearm available in the game is a military grade automatic rifle. Every weapon also features a secondary function so the weapons are actually very unique and fun to use. I especially love the rotary saw and that weapon is very useful in defeating small and fast enemies.\n\nLike in Resident Evil 4, the game has a lot of ammunition and items lying around the ship and even dropped by Necromorphs when they are killed. The game also features a store where you can buy and sell items or store them in a safe for later use. The player can also upgrade Isaacs suit and weapons with power nodes which again is something we see a lot in Resident Evil 4. Theres also a melee attack but it kind of sucks and I never found the right time to use it.\n\nIsaac is also equipped with other tools to help him survive, solve puzzles and combat enemies more effectively. Isaac has a Stasis ability which can be used to slow down enemies and objects temporarily and a Kinesis module which allows Isaac to pick up items and throw them which is like the gravity gun in Half-Life 2. There are also times when Isaac has to proceed in the vacuum of space and zero gravity which allows Isaac to stick to walls due to his boots being magnetic. The suit prevents Isaac from suffering from radiation like in real life, but his oxygen supply is limited and he will suffocate which forces the player to get done quickly.\n\nThe music and audio quality is also very good and got several awards for best audio and sound design. The flaws with this game are kind of minor such as the fact you can hear sound in the vacuum of space which is an impossibility in real life, the 3D map kind of sucks and doesnt really let you explore it, the puzzle to solve are too easy and the fact the game can tell you at any time where to go by activating a blue beam of light for a couple seconds which points you in the right direction, but its still a very good game. I know this game was made by Electronic Arts and theyve recently developed a reputation as being one of the worst companies in America, don't let that stop you from trying out this game. If you are into survival horror and action, this game is a must have. Its one of the best survival horror action games out there. It has both action and intense scares and not for the faint of hard. There are even some mini games such as a shooting range and some kind of futuristic form of basketball in zero gravity. Id say this game is a combination of Doom 3 and Resident Evil 4 and a very epic game. And no, I don't side with EA, I think they are terrible, but they got everything right with this game, I promise.\n\nRATING: 9.5 out of 10", "summary": "Has both lots of scares and action, I love it", "unixReviewTime": 1396396800}

Advance Wars has been one of my favorites ever since it came across the Pacific.  I can't say that Drone Tactics is as good as Advance Wars, but it definitely holds its own when it comes down to raw gameplay.\n\nStory: 3/10  Boring, generic, poor dialog.  This is not the reason you want this game.  To sum it up you are a bug-loving kid with some friends who share your fascination with the tiny creeps.  You all get pulled into an alternate world in which bugs talk and can become giant robots.  You fight to save their world against other humans that have evil plans for the poor little (or giant if they are in robot form) bugs.\n\nMusic: 7/10  Adequate enough.  Nothing fancy, but it serves it's purpose.\n\nGraphics: 9/10  For a DS game these are really nice graphics.  There are 3-D animations of the bugs when you attack.  Let's just say they look excellent.  Otherwise you are looking at 2-D graphics on the battlefield, but they are nice as well.\n\nGameplay: 10/10  This is the key to this game.  You get one each of a variety of different drones (e.g. Butterfly, Praying Mantis, Pill Bug) with their own special characteristics.  For the pleasure of customization freaks everywhere you can also equip your drones with different weapons that can change power, accuracy, speed, and other stats.  You also acquire cards to assemble a deck.  You can use each card once per battle (they don't disappear permanently, you just can't use it multiple times per stage) with varying effects such as healing, extra damage, teleporting a nearby ally to another location, and dropping obstacles.  The cards add more strategy to an already deep game.  When you use a card to increase your damage you play some minigames to see how much extra damage you do.  All of this adds up to a game that keeps every battle fresh and interesting.  You can also play multiplayer with a friend (not online), but I don't have anybody to test it out with.\n\nOverall: 9/10  I can't say this game is perfect due to the mediocre music and story, but the strategic gameplay more than makes up for it.  If you like turn based strategy games you will probably enjoy Drone Tactics.  And, hey, it's produced by Atlus.

The graphics look pretty much the same, but cleaner. The animations to each character look extremely vibrant and colorful. The audio is improved and tweaked. So far, we don't have any bad voice actors (that is until Super Street Fighter II comes up) in this game. And the sounds of hitting still haven't changed one bit. As for the line of characters, still the same as Champion Edition's. You have Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, Guile, Dhalsim, Blanka, Sagat, M.Bison, Balrog, and Vega.

If you end up selling it and later on feel like playing the game again, it'll probably take forever to find the game again, since it's a rare product now !

In fact I had been playing atleast a year and a half by the time Lord of Destruction emerges.  And in that time I had had the greatest experience in my life.\n\nAt first I was just a lowely Barbarian, who wore a loin-cloth and hit monsters with my crappy axe.  But countless hours of online and offline play later, I was a badass looking barbarian with a thirst for blood.  And the online gaming is really where this game shines.  For one thing, Battle.net is free.  And another thing is that people don't just play this game online, they live it.  If my computer hadn't been total crap and stopped working, and I hadn't had to do other things, like go to work and try to maintain a relationship with actual people that I could touch and smell, then I would be going on my fourth year of playing this game.  But now that I have recently gotten back online and into the new wave of gamers, I am now, once again, completely addicted.\n\nAnd when I say new wave of gamers, that's exactly what I mean.  Recently I was down at my local EB Games to pick up some games when I got into a conversation with the clerk there about Diablo II.  And for the first once, somebody actually knew where I was coming from.  You see, he had also played back in the old days before the expansion came out, and also noticed a difference in today's gamers.\n\nFor one thing, people nowadays want something from you, even if you have nothing.  For example, I was playing with my level 64 sorceress and I was searching all over the active channels looking for an item called a Lum Rune.  Finally, I came across a room with a lvl. 83 amazon who, when asked, told me she had three Lum Runes.  After seeing that I had nothing she wanted, she told me off and left the room.  I mean, come on!  Be nice, she had three and I had none.  She was like close to 30 levels ahead of me and couldn't spare to drop one of them.  Back in the day, people would make rooms just to drop things for free.  Of course back then almost everybody who was cool was a hacked character.  And things like elixers and the Jamella editor still existed.  Nowadays, people think being hacked means to have your stuff stolen.  No kids, that is getting screwed.  Getting hacked means you have acquired items from the games mainframe and are using them even though you aren't really supposed to for another 50 levels.  Being hacked meant you had everything you wanted and nobody was the wiser.\n\nBut anyway, about the expansion.  It introduces two new character classes, the Druid and the Assassin.  Making the total amount of playable characters seven (including the last game's Barbarian, Paladin, Necromancer, Sorceress, and Amazon).  Both of which are pretty cool characters.  Anyway, the game's praphics got touched up a bit, they are still sprites, but they fit the game perfectly.\n\nI guess the one good thing about not having hacked cheater characters in the new version is you don't have to worry about anyone being invincible when you're dueling them (hacked characters tended to have something like 10 million hit points while the average player had less than a thousand).  So if you like your social life, steer clear of this drug, because once you're in, there's no telling when anybody will see you again.", "summary": "the greatest game ever made", "unixReviewTime": 1094688000}

After beating and selling Watch Dogs (PS4), and then getting this on Summer Sale and really not liking it at all, I came to the conclusion I will no longer buy the trinity of Ubisoft open world action games.\n\nIf you have played any Assassin's Creed or Watch Dogs, then you've played this. Towers to unlock, stupid collectibles, incredibly poor stealth, no actual cover.\n\nTOWERS ARE SO FAR APART, horrible when you die. This is a perfect example of huge open world that is empty, lifeless, and annoying. So, so annoying.\n\nInventory is an atrocity, fills up in minutes, herbs don't stack. The driving is even worse than Watch Dogs, if that is possible.

I *might* get them for 10 bucks or buy and resell of the PS4, but never ever full price.\n\nAnd the graphics aren't that great, because Ubisoft is really bad at optimizing game engines.

Anyway enough with that on to what I thought of the game.\n\nThis game manage to do something GTA 4 did not do hold my attention.  You knew that comparison was comming. Even though this game is known for its over the top nature the story missions are anything that you would see in a GTA series. Escort somebody here, protect this, go in a building a shoot everyone up you get the picture. The story presented itself in a pretty realistic way. The game goes crazy with the side missions. I don't want to get into them but the fight club, fuzz, drug trafficing and property damage was some of my favorites. If you never played a side mission and stuck to the maing story you would see this game a s being fairly serious. Being able to customise your character was fun. I liked being able to make a sexy woman causing all this mayhem. Usualy its a guy you see doing this stuff. Making a female character was a nice change of pace. The one major downside was how many times this game crashed on me. This game would crashed just about everytime I played it in the begining. That is completly unexceptable. I can deal with some glitches, like the one where my car got stuck in the road for no reason and I could not drive. But, the game just crashing no thats pathetic. The timing of the crashes was the worst. I had a tendency to crash after I beat a mission, right before the game would load back up it would freeze. Turn system off, redo the the mission over, that sucked.\n\nDespite the flaws off the game it is really fun. For me atleast it managed not to get stale. It is not a five star game, but I enjoyed it so much I game it that high a score. Gta 4 managed to take itself way to serious and managed at times to be stale instead of fun.

The graphics are outstanding, but that has come to be expected when a game rests on the sheer brute power of the xbox 360 game console.\n\nThe two main playable characters are interesting and each has their own play style and abilities. Over time you will end up having a favorite of the two characters. Some might prefer that characters back story, personality or skills and abilities.\n\nThe levels do tend to get boring and repetitive however. Though the graphics help bring the levels to life, they do still get very boring. With the game being set in the wild west, they all tend to look exactly alike. Dust covered trails, old wooden buildings and lots and lots of brush..and the occasional mine thrown in to add a splash of difference.\n\nThe weapons are boring as well, but to be fair its the 1800s, and you aren't going to get anything that screams Wow. Sorry, no alien lasers. Just hand guns, rifles and TNTalthough the bible does prove to be an interesting Weapon when using the rev.\n\nAs far as vehicles go, theres horses you can ride, though they are a bit difficult to control, and using a weapon while riding high in the saddle? Next to impossible.\n\nThe difficulty of the game isn't really that hard either, even when on the higher difficulty settings, which means most gamers will just zoom through this title, so if you are looking for a drawn out epic title, you might be disappointed with this.\n\nOver all, I would say this title is slightly below average, and could have been improved on so many levels.

It brought in a new era of games with underground, but underground wasn't about the cops and the exotics, it was about fast cars you find on the street every day. Basically, it was Need for Speed: Fast and Furious Edition. The trend continued for a long time, and continued onto the new consoles with Most Wanted, Carbon, and Undercover. The thing was, as they drifted further from the roots of what need for speed was all about, the games lost the essence of what Need for Speed is. And honestly, the name says it all.\n\nEnter NFS: HP, a new revolution or a \"reset\" to the series, that picks up right where the PS2 dropped it off. Hot Pursuit comes back to what Need for Speed is all about, and why so many of us were hooked on the PS1 and PS2 versions of the games (yes the PC gamers too) Driving fast cars, getting away from the cops, and going so darn fast you have trouble dodging a car because your brain can't register its there before your taillight makes a beeline through your skull.\n\nBut, that's enough background, on to the review.\n\nThe good:\n\nThe Menus:\nSimple, easy to read, and coherent, even down to the Autolog, and all of its messages and information. The menu's are very easy to navigate and easy to understand. The Career Map reminds me of Burnout 3, which I'm not surprised about really considering Criterion made the game, the menu works the same too, you highlight a sign and select an event to run. You only start with a few for either Cops or Racers and you earn more as you level up and complete events. The Map doesn't look cluttered, and is presented intuitively (and flashy to boot)if you hate driving around all the time to find events you'll love this. They also included a free roam if you want it. The Career menu has sister menus accessed by the buttons on the controller rather than finding them through the main menu which is also nice. Everything is just, easy.\n\nThe Gameplay\nThe best way i can put this is if you somehow made a lovechild of Burnout 3, and NFS: HP2. you'd get this game. The cars handle weightly like Hot Pursuit 2's do, but they FEEL like Burnout 3 cars, (touchy and drifty)Its actually a surprisingly good balance. The car's are much more subject to speed loss and much less receptive of wall bouncing than Burnout as well. What's the most interesting is the game's approach to damage in normal driving. You can be wrecked, and you can total your car (at least i think so, i never actually managed to do it) but you can cause this by brawling like in burnout. What's so strange, is though you CAN do it, it slows you down so much you'll probably lose if you do it on purpose all the time. Despite its flashy crashes and damage, Hot Pursuit rewards you for driving clean, not dirty in relation to bumping and grinding.\n\nPicking Sides:\n\nYou can race as a Racer, or a Cop, in multiple race modes like you would think including time trials, i'm going to say \"Burning Laps\" as a reference because they feel so burnout. (game calls them Previews BTW) Or cool stuff like taking out the racers before they finish as a cop, with much more. I won't tell you everything, but each mode is attacked a bit differently.\n\nAn Arsenal, IN YOUR TRUNK!:\n\nLater you unlock some \"Potent Treasures\" as a racer or a cop, like EMP, or Spike Strips which gives a new element to races including them, you're not just a danger to the cops or the racers on the opposite faction, you're dangerous to everyone. Imagine its two racers left, the cops are right behind, and you've got a spike, you can shake the cops with a spike and fight your rival to the end, or you can take HIM out and fight the cops yourself, or better yet, get him busted. Its decisions like this that make this game awesome online, and off.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThere are issues with everything, HP is an arcade racer, it doesn't behave a predictably or as harshly as a game like Forza, Gran Turismo, of NFS Shift will. They're not the same kind of game That said, there are some issues i have with the game:\n\nSome cars seem underwhelming in a class:\nThe balance at times will make itself much more evident online but in my experience, some cars seem to be bottom tier in the tier they are in, either due to the fact that they handle like a barge or that they have a rather low top speed. We'll see online soon enough, but i'm sure there will be a \"Competitive Car\" as any racing game has when it goes mainstream public after about a month or two. Still there are no settings to dial in so maybe we'll see a good mixed community.\n\nPacing:\nThough good, i thought it moved a bit, slow. I got to level 4 racer in about 4 hours, that said, i unlocked a lot of stuff in that time. I guess i just had this notion that i'd level up faster, and then it kind of hit me that to get to max level, i would have to play a long time, and that likely without the online component i'd need to do a lot of re-racing to get there. Though i could be wrong entirely, it certainly does not seem that career will net you max level.\n\nLearning Curve\nThis game has got some really impressive difficulty, to win, i had to try, to put that in perspective i've had to try to win in Most wanted, once, and that was the last time i did. However for a newcomer, it may be very frustrating to compete with opponents. But once you get the hang of it, its fun.\n\nThese things don't take really ANYTHING from the game as a whole. This is the best TRUE Need For Speed title in a decade, and Criterion needs to be praised along with EA for once for finally taking the Need For Speed series back to where it came from. Its a Missing Niche in gaming, and it was very missed.\n\nExcellent title for any age, Strongly Recommended for PC, 360, or PS3", "summary": "\"It offers improved accelleration, and a slightly higher top speed\"", "unixReviewTime": 1290211200}

I absolutely love the build and feel of the stick. I like the feel of the buttons, their placement, and the \"feel\" of the stick as it moves around the two axes. I just wish it was not using 8-bit precision.\n\nMore modern joysticks are using 12 or 16 bit precision which gives you a smoother experience and finer control. The other issue encountered with 8bit is a constant \"jitter\" in the axes. This is far more noticeable on the throttle, but it affects the stick as well. Coupled with the less fine control I can achieve with more modern sticks I had to put this stick up on the shelf in favor of other products available.\n\nIf CH updates to 16-bit and keeps their current basic design/feel, I would definitely buy the updated stick and throttle. The stick is fantastic, it just needs to be updated to leave 1980.\nI unfortunately cannot recommend the stick in its current state over more modern 12 and 16 bit sticks available.", "summary": "Not bad, but needs updating", "unixReviewTime": 1494115200}

Tsongas", "reviewText": "I purchased this game along with my new Xbox One. I wanted to pick a game that really showcased the power of next gen consoles and based (at least initially) on the reviews of the game, it seemed like a good choice. Additionally, I had been a fan of the Wolfenstein franchise from the early 90s.\n\nUnfortunately, the game has come up short on several fronts. Let me itemize the good and the bad:\n\nThe Good\n- Graphics are very well done. The textures and cut scenes look very good although not quite as 'advanced' looking as I would have expected on a next gen console. But nonetheless, still quite impressive.\n- The weapon play and controls are done well and the menu options are intuitive and easy to comprehend\n\nThe Bad\n- The story drags terribly. As an FPS with a single player campaign, I understand the need for brief interludes here and there. But this game utilized them too frequently, basically stalling forward movement and creating a fragmented storyline that had too many instances of minimal action and extended areas of un-necessary dialog. Better editing would have helped tremendously here.\n- The game is EXTREMELY buggy. This was, hands down, the biggest frustration point. It all began when attempting to install the game, which is a requirement for play. The installation procedure failed numerous times at the offset. I had to repeatedly restart the install in order to get to the point where I could play the game. Unfortunately, that is where I ran into the second problem: the game started to repeatedly freeze during gameplay. The good thing is on next gen consoles, you can stop the game like a mobile app without having to reboot the console. But the freezes were happening at virtually the same point in the game. After searching online for answers, I found numerous users were experiencing similar problems. After reading some tech notes, most recommended deleting the game and re-installing it while the console was not connected to the internet. I did that, although I ran into problems with the install yet again. Once the second install was complete, I could move forward into the campaign only to encounter ANOTHER point where the game would arbitrarily freeze at certain points. Despite restarting the game, the freezes would not allow me to continue. I now proceeded to delete and reinstall the game for a THIRD time. Once again, I could proceed in the campaign only to encounter the game freezes further on! At this point, I finally reached my breaking point and stopped playing.\nIt is very obvious that Bethesda did NOT do an adequate job of proper QA on this game, as I have read numerous stories online of users encountering similar issues. I emailed Bethesda tech support asking for assistance and received no reply.\n\nUltimately, the game itself could have been a good showcase for next gen consoles, but these quality issues really put a damper on the playability of the game as a whole. I hope Bethesda is taking time to deal with these issues so other gamers have a more fluid gaming experience.", "summary": "Basically unplayable", "unixReviewTime": 1404604800}

From what I've read on gaming forums that at least one developer has participated in, this was never meant to be \"Railroad Tycoon 4\", and to that end at least there's truth in advertising.\n\nBeyond that however, the changes are designed solely to cater to the casual gaming crowd and to drive up sales. I cannot imagine any other reason, since released as is this game was bound to disappoint long-time RRT series fans. The fact that they do not even include a map or scenario editor to extend the pitifully short life of the game's included maps is perhaps the most disappointing. The scale of the maps has already been beaten to death, but those other reviewers are not inaccurately describing their cramped nature. Everything else that was even remotely challenging (track laying, the stock market, chained economies, etc.) in the previous titles is more or less gone or dumbed down to near pointlessness.\n\nThis is a game that caters to the Sims crowd, and that is not a bad thing in itself but I fear games like this will become ever more numerous as sales numbers overtake depth and challenge and catering to smaller, more \"intense\" and educated gamers.

Dr. EggMan tricks him and sucks the power from the Chaos Emeralds. Then,Sonic turns into a fierce looking creature and falls of the ship. A huge crack in the earth made pieces split apart. Sonic the Mets Chip,a little critter. He joins Sonic on his journey to save the world and turn back into himself.

At day,you run around,making the best time limit. There are robots to destroy,plus,you can dash all over the place. It doesn't take long,but some are hard. For some,you need to press certain buttons to go through,or you'll die. Plus,sometimes there are bosses. At night,you need to use skill. At night,there are powerful combos,you can use against creatures. You can even pick them up and throw them at other critters. You can't run fast,instead,run on all fours. You can punch,and scratch enemy,your arms stretch,and it's awesome. The bosses are real hard. On unleashed from,you get faster,and stronger. At the end of every battle,you can use the experience to level up Sonics stats. Plus,Sonic needs to a normal form to go to the Orange stages. And he needs to be at his Wearhog form  to go to the indigo stages.\n\nIt might look dumb,but this is amazing. It's a real fun game. Great story.

After beating it, I can give my two cents. It is way too short, bar none. This would have been a five-star game if there was more depth to it. Now despite playing the quests given to the player, there is a good bit of freelance stuff to do like interact with NPCs, make tons of money and lose it at will, so this aspect I do like.\n\nGRAPHICS: Totally beautiful, from the shadowing to intricate detail in even the most insignificant objects. Reason enough to at least check it out.\n\nPLAYABILITY: I did have a lot of fun while playing Fable. You can always decide to do some mean stuff to people for kicks, and the body count can get fairly high while going through the game. There isn't too much gore, but blood doesn't have to spew onto the screen to have a great time.\n\nSTORYLINE: Great storyline overall. The cinematics aren't overlong or filled with silly writing like some of these newer releases. Depending on what alignment you lean towards, there could have been a bit more of a change, but that's okay.\n\nDIFFICULTY: A bit too easy all the way through. Especially with the final opponent, I had a low level lightning skill and was able to defeat him with no worries at all. This helps with my neverending desire to end the lives of countless NPCs, but how much is too much? A challenge may be desired elsewhere.\n\nREPLAY: Fable is unfortunately not as engaging as I had hoped.

It is fun to play, as you guide Link and his crew through this exciting game filled with missions, quests, and puzzles that are sure to blow you away, with the simple control of the stylus that works great with the game. The graphics handle great, while the gameplay brings in a whole new dimension of gameplay which is something we haven't seen in the Zelda franchise as of yet.\n\nAll in all, I am a huge fan of the Nintendo DS, and I absolutely recommend The Nintendo DS Gold Legend Of Zelda bundlepack. It is angreat for those who haven't yet had the DS experience, and for those who are just simply tired of trying to find the Wii, or for those who want a great challenging video game system ata bargain price. I absoluetly recommend the Nintendo DS Lite, as a must buy for any gamers collection.

The load times are absoluty mind numbing and it's quite painful to watch the gear (the object that indicates loading). move S...L...O...W...L...Y.  And it's no help either that the game gives you a boring backround to read, basically the controls over a grey, boring backround. Waiting for a game will never kill you as much as this.  I think this gets my vote as the worst load times ever seen in a videogame.  Too bad they couldn't put a game as a loading screen (but that would probally add two more minutes to the load times).\n\nIt's too bad that the load times are such a shame, because this game is a wonderful, offroad masterpiece that would be perfect if the developers would have put some time into the game.  THis is the best offroader for the PSP, and it's alot better than Sony's ATV offroad fury game for PSP.  The controls are sliky smooth and there are a huge variety of vehicls and race types.  THis game will keep you busy for a long time.  There are short tracks, monster truck designed courses, Motorcross stadiums, conventianls, uphill climbs, and much more.\n\ngraphics are impressive, and the levels are varied and the locations are fine, especially such levels like the Jungle Falls level or the Egypt level.  The riders are designed well to.  The ground textures are a little bland, but it reall dosent' stand out unless your always focus on it.  Speaking of variety, did I mention all the great vehicles?  They all handle well, and are a blast to play with.  Usually, vehicles like this feel like tacked on extras that were just poorly made,  but heck, even the Golf Carts are fun.  Need I say more.  Nah, this game is just a great offroad racer.  SO far, it's the best one on the PSP.\n\nThe only problem besides the obvious is the disastrous music soundtrack.  Sorry, but I am not into Crossfade, Papa Roach, and all the other radio rock tripe they have on this.  At least the Bullets And Octane song is good.\n\nThis game is a great racing game that will do a fine job of sating portable speed on the go.

Your clones are faceless and never take off their helmets, the armor is huge and bulky and color coded so they all kinda look like gun totting power rangers on steroids but the gameplay is solid, more than solid, your troops obey you and don't do stupid stuff like charging into a room full of baddies only to get themselves snuffed. In this day and age there are better games, but if you like Star Wars, and wanted to know what it was like for the clones instead of the jedi during the clone wars then this would be the game for you.\n\nPS graphically this game still looks quite nice.

It's finally here. After what I thought was a disappointment in Bungie's final Halo game, Halo: Reach, 343 Industries has taken the helm for a new trilogy. Halo 4 takes place after Halo 3, which was released over 5 years ago now. How is this game different?\n\nAs far as multiplayer (That will be the highlight of my review, sorry for the campaign fans), 343 has implemented a lot of things from Call of Duty. Don't let that scare you though if that idea doesn't sound good to you -- it works flawlessly in Halo 4. While the perks seem to run the multiplayer in Call of Duty, what truly should be the difference -- the gun -- is what truly matters in Halo 4. Unlike Call of Duty, there doesn't seem to be any overpowered \"perk\" in this game. Some of the guns seem to be excessively powerful, but they all have downfalls. Whether that downfall is a small clip or something else, 343 makes sure nothing in the game is gamebreaking, which is impressive. Something that should also be noted is that everybody in multiplayer now has the ability to sprint for a limited time, which makes the gameplay faster paced and more frantic. That inclusion, unsurprisingly, only makes this game better.\n\nThe maps in the multiplayer mostly range from good to fantastic, with not even one map that I would say I truly dislike. The maps here have a vast variety from small to large in size, and snowy to grassy. My personal favorite has to be Exile, which is a fairly big map that makes for hectic Capture the Flag matches, and it just looks and plays phenomenally.\n\nIf you enjoyed Firefight from Reach, I'm sorry to say it's not returning. Instead though, 343 has included Spartan Ops. In this free mode, content will be released weekly with several episodes for you and your friends to play in. While the missions are fairly entertaining, I'm not quite sure what the purpose of them is, mainly because they seem to end before you even start going.\n\nAs for the campaign, I won't spoil a thing, but I will tell you that this is probably the best campaign yet in the series. The voice acting is better than ever, the humans' facial reactions are spot on, and there are -- thankfully -- very few parts in it that aren't fun. I can also tell you that this is one of the hardest campaigns I've played in a shooter... at least on its highest difficulty setting, Legendary.\n\nI tried to keep this review relatively short. There is a lot to say about this game and its contents, but I wouldn't be able to do the game justice. Rather than have you waste 20 minutes reading this review, I'd rather give you that time to go out and get the game if you haven't already.\n\nHalo 4 won't exactly change the genre, but it has taken the essences of Halo 3 and the good portions of Halo: Reach (Did I mention there's no Armor Lock in this game?), and made one of the best online gaming experiences for this generation. It could well be the closest thing you'll find to Xbox LIVE multiplayer gaming nirvana.\n\n5/5", "summary": "Game of the Year", "unixReviewTime": 1352160000}

I only didn't give it all five stars, because it was very glitchy throughout the entire game.\nGameplay:\nThe actual gameplay was awesome when I didn't run into any glitches.  Lara has the ability to climb rocks with her ax, slide down zip lines, and climb buildings.  Lara's movements are pretty close to Assassin's Creed, but with slightly less freedom in what you can climb.\nWhen it comes down to combat you have the choice to be stealthy or go in guns blazing.  Weapon selection was pretty limited, but that's okay in a game like this.  You have the choice to use a bow, shotgun, piston, or a riffle.  I ended up using the bow the most, because it was quiet.  You can also upgrade your weapons along with your skills when you find a comb site.\nStory:  This Tomb Raider has the best story, plot and characters that the franchise has ever seen.  The story is so good that you can easily loose track of time.\nGraphics:\nI definitely could tell the difference in graphics from the 360 to Xbox One version.  Things like the blood and dirt on Lara's face really stuck out on the Xbox One compared to the 360 edition.  I also noticed that the weather and landscapes looked very real, which made this game into an experience rather than just another game.\nPackaging:  This review is for the Definitive Art Book Edition, which comes in a special art book case rather than generic Xbox case.  The art book has a little over 10 front and back pages of full color concept art that makes this edition that much more special for the same price.  It's not a good idea to pay extra for this edition since you can still find this edition in stores.\nGlitches:\nEven though I loved this game I was very frustrated at times with the many glitches.  In fact, several times I needed to restart checkpoints, but most of the time that didn't work, so I needed to go one step further and completely restart my Xbox.  If it wasn't for the glitches I would had given this game five stars, but luckily the glitches weren't bad enough from preventing me from completing the game.\nBottom line:\nYou might get lucky and get through the game with little or no glitches, but be warned that you probably will run into some, but when it comes to the story of the game you can't get much better than what they delivered.  If you didn't play the 360 edition or never finished it, then I recommend trying the Xbox One edition.", "summary": "A Great Game With a Many Glitches", "unixReviewTime": 1402704000}

However, I will elaborate.\nThe game's plot revolves around multiple dimension-like worlds in the Disney and Final Fantasy universe.  Kind of like a Mickey Mouse version of the show \"Sliders\".  Anyway, you have to travel to all of these worlds looking for your standard bad guys the Heartless.  Your main character, Sora, holds the key to defeating the Heartless and setting things right again.  I'm not kidding, he actually uses a weapon called a \"keyblade\".  And you thought the gunblade was original.  In your travels you'll go to Agrabah (home of Aladdin), Wonderland, Neverland, Olympus, Tarzan's jungle, and others.  All the while encountering critters from Disney cartoons and Final Fantasy games.\nBeing a Final Fantasy fan, the major draw for me in this game was seeing Final Fantasy characters from Final Fantasy 7, 8, and 10.  Unfortunately, this is one aspect of the game that disappoints.  Cameos are limited.  I haven't played through the entire game but it seems that the only characters playing significant roles are Leon (aka Squall from FF8), Cid (from FF7), and a little bit from Yuffie (FF7) and Aerith (Aeris/FF7).  Sure old favorites Cloud and Sephiroth make appearances, but they don't play major roles in the game.  And in the end, you could easily replace them with normal, original NPCs.  Square's number one reason for including them is to pander to the Final Fantasy crowd.  Mission accomplished, I bought it.\nYou'll mostly be encountering Disney characters.  Disney NPCs, Disney party members, even Disney summon monsters.  For me, all that Disney stuff would make me vomit, but it isn't as childish as you would think.  Donald and Goofy provide you with battle support and they're good for a laugh in cutscenes.  On the downside, all of the worlds I've seen so far are Disney worlds, nothing from Final Fantasy, or at least anything original - except for the first island you start on, and that reminds me of Besaid from FFX.\nThe voice acting in the game is short.  Most of what you see are dialogue boxes or speech bubbles instead of actual voices.  But the voices that are in the game are excellent.  Square and Disney actually hired some professional talent for a few of the non-Disney characters.  And even the Disney characters are voiced by either the original voice actor from their respective movies, or the actor from the TV series spinoff (in a few cases).  The dialogue is a little choppy in some areas, but it's not as ridiculous as some of the translated dialogue in other games.\nPlay control.  Jeez.  Controlling your character is relatively easy.  Battles are a little tougher because of the battle menu, but they do provide a few shortcut buttons for magic, etc.  The absolute worst thing is the platform jumping.  Between the camera angles and your nitwit sidekicks, it's difficult to land some jumps.  Donald and Goofy are constantly in the way, they follow you around like the characters in Final Fantasy 8 do, unfortunately you can't walk through them.  I had to push Goofy off a ledge a few times just to see where I was going.  They do add a remedy for the problems - a first person \"look around\" view.  It helps to see around and to line yourself up with a jump, but it doesn't help if you turn the camera around to look for a platform only to see that annoying duck standing in your way.  And in battle they were basically useless for me.  After playing Devil May Cry, I'm good enough with melee sword combat that I don't need the backup of a giant dog with a shield and a duck who can't hit a monster the size of a building with a fire spell.\nThe minor problems aside, the game has its strengths.  The story and the cutscenes make you feel like you're actually controlling a Disney movie - not necessarily a bad thing.  And the freedom of movement in battles was a nice change from turn-based Final Fantasy combat.  It's no Final Fantasy X, but Kingdom Hearts ranks as one of the best RPGs I've ever played.\nPros:\n-Great battle system\n-Top notch voice acting\n-Music is good and it sets the mood in certain areas\n-Original and engaging story\nCons:\n-Donald and Goofy get in the way\n-Other members of your party aren't very helpful in battle\n-Final Fantasy angle not as prominant as many would like\nOverall I gave it four stars taking into consideration the flaws.  If you're looking for an original RPG, I would recommend this game.  But if you're looking for a Final Fantasy clone, this isn't it.  Otherwise I think everyone should give this game a shot.  Rent it first, and if you like it then buy it.", "summary": "Surprisingly Adequate", "unixReviewTime": 1037232000}

This is a side scrolling shooter that offers tons of variety if you're willing to put the time in to customize levels, ships, etc.\n\nThe \"campaign,\" which is just a series of different levels without any plot (not that that's surprising), is decent.  It's not great, but it serves its purpose of offering an enjoyable set of missions to pick up and play.  It also pretty challenging, and it says that you can play it with two players (I assume simultaneously rather than alternating, but I'm not completely sure).  You can unlock some extras (one of which is the Japanese game that Blast Works is based off of), but I haven't unlocked many so far.\n\nWhat's really cool is that as you kill enemies, you can fly into them before they fall off the screen which attaches them to you.  Through this method you can have a massive amalgamation of enemy parts and ships that shoot along with you for added destructiveness.  They can be destroyed off of you, but if you keep it up you can virtually fill up the screen!\n\nThe big appeal of this game comes from the customization possibilities.  Although it takes some time to understand how it all works, once you figure it out you will be making stuff that you couldn't have imagined!  You can create enemies, ships for yourself, levels, bosses, etc.  There are tons of different types of parts you can use, you can make your blaster shoot in an insanely large variety of ways, and you can even decide how much defense your enemies have.  You can create ultra complicated bosses that consist of multiple parts, that fire 10 different kinds of blasts, and are virtually impossible to defeat.  Make them big or small, mobile or static, gun crazy or not.  Whatever you want to make, you can make it.\n\nThe only real problems with this game are rather minor overall.  One is that even though you can customize so much, you still have to customize within the bounds of the visual style of the game.  Your creations won't be able to look like stream-lined jets or anything.  However, you can still create some pretty cool stuff.\n\nThe music is definitely sub-par.  It's pretty mellow and boring, but not a game-breaker.\n\nThe other problem is that it seems to freeze relatively often when loading between screens.  It doesn't happen all the time, but it's more often than all of my other games.\n\nNeither of these issues are a particularly big deal, IMO.  Although the freezing problem made me knock my review down to a four rather than a five, it doesn't make me regret purchasing this game.  For the price, it's really a stellar game.

It was my stupid fault for not realizing I needed to scroll down on the account creation screen to create a local profile.  Now the game works fine and is just as great as I imagined.  Runs VERY smoothly so far, and the graphics are amazing.  Much better than what you get on the Xbox 360 version.  I've already played it before on Xbox 360 so I already know the story will be 5-star, and this game is definitely worth the money if your PC can run it.  If not, I definitely suggest it on either Xbox 360 or PS3.  Especially \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\" which added tons of stuff to the game that wasn't there before.  Such as parachute's, new helicopters, new weapons, etc.\n\nI'm still giving it a 4/5 for now until I can get it to work online.  I'm still stuck in the loophole where it won't let me recover my profile until I update the game, and the game won't update for whatever reason.  And Rockstar doesn't seem to have the patch available for manual download yet.  It shows up on their site but when you click to download you get an error, so I guess I'm out of luck until that gets fixed.\n\nBut, the game is definitely worth it!\n\n*ORIGINAL REVIEW*\n\nMy title just about says it all.  I received this game today, installed it, entered my serial, but then when I go to make a profile is where I run into a problem.  I tried to recover my LIVE profile, as I already have one, and during account recovery, a window pops up, that cancels recovery, and tells me there's an update the I will have to install to play on LIVE.  So, I click on update, and it shows the updating screen, but ten seconds later it comes up with an error \"update could not be downloaded\".  So, after I close that, all I can do is try to recover my profile again, and it's an endless loop of the game telling me I need the update first before I can recover my account.\n\nFine, I'd like to play this game on my account, but I'll give in and try making a new account.  This brings the same problem.  You have to make a new account through [...], and then must recover it in the game.  During recovery, the same thing happens, and it prompts for an update.  I can say no, but then it won't let me recover my profile.  My other choice is to create an offline profile, but I can't even find that option.  Not to mention I'd like to play a game I paid for online instead of offline.\n\nSo, I visit multiple websites looking for an update.  I downloaded RGSC and tried to install that first thinking it may be the problem, but when installing it says I have an unsupported OS which I don't understand at all being that I'm using Windows 7.  So I forget that and try to download some other updates.  None of the \"regular\" GTA IV updates will work so I figure it's not one of those I need.  Then I find out there's an update \"1.1.1.0\" for Episodes from Liberty City.  The ONLY place I can find it is on Rockstar, and when I try to download it I get an error.\n\nSo, basically I'm stuck in some kind of loophole, and I can't even play my game.  Well, I can play it, but only if I choose not to save my game, which would be pointless.  And maybe I'm just overlooking something, but there's seriously no where in the guide where it says offline profile.  It provides me two options to click, and the first one automatically requests I open a browser window to create a profile on [...], and the other is something like, \"close window\" or whatever.  So, there's no \"offline profile\" option that I see.\n\nHopefully I can find a way to download the update soon enough and get my game working.  And hopefully then I'll be able to recover my profile without any problem.  I'm not sure if I'm the only one having this problem, but I can't seem to find anything about it online.\n\nI will note that regardless of this problem I have played both \"The Lost and The Damned\", and \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\" on my Xbox 360, and both were VERY fun.  Definitely worth the $[...] if this problem get fixed...and it might just be a problem I'm having.  I have also played GTA IV on my PC, and it was very fun as well.  I have no doubt these expansions will be MUCH better on PC than they were on Xbox 360, I really just have to find a way to get them working.", "summary": "Great game that everyone should play at least once!", "unixReviewTime": 1271116800}

I think it has something to do with the DVD drive trying to load sounds and locking up.\n\n2) \"Unreadable Disk Errors\" are VERY common.

In fact we have been presented with Glitch-city. I have never run in to a Borderlands game,or any game for that matter, that has had so many glitches. One is bad enough,but I am only about half way through and there are four major faults with this game already.\nThe first biggie is the fact that they have for the first time made playing with friends the default mode. In games past it has always been the user which has determined whether to connect and play with friends,play solo,or what have you. I prefer solo first,as I always wish to learn a game on my own ,so if I do decide to play with friends,I have somewhat of an idea of how to play without embarrassing myself.\nThe second one is if you change it to offline(solo) it does NOT remember your selection for the next time you play. That is every game you return to play you have to pick your choice of how to play all over again. C'mon.\nThirdly, as you approach a door to the first boss battle(against Deadlift),it does no open!?? That's right,there is no access or continuance of play beyond that area. The only way to get around it is to play solo(offline) and then it will open. I only found that out by trial and error.\nFourth and finally there is a Vault key symbol in the Titan Robot Production Plant...the only one. You approach it to press\"e\" to discover it, but it won't let you. You cannot discover the symbol. So there goes your perfect game,if you,like me,are trying to obtain one.\nAs I say I am not all the way through yet,so who knows what else I will find.\nOn the good side the game's controls and handling are pretty much the same from previous versions. And they give you an in game \"reward\" if this game detects any other installed version of Borderlands.\nAll in all a Borderlands all players of the previous versions will appreciate. However the glitches are something that should NOT be in a game like this and in that many numbers. Somebody screwed up royally in the testing department. It is not what we previous Borderlands players and/or newbies to the game should find when shelling out our hard earned bucks. 2 1/2-3 stars. And don't get me started on the guide(see my review on that)!\nNov. 11/14 Update:\nWell I have finished the game and of course have found more glitches. There is what they call a \"grinder\" machine. It works by inputting three items from your back pack into it,and even moonstones that you collect,to make an entirely new weapon. Well,it doesn't work...never has,never will. I have noticed that if you travel back through a boss area you have been through and defeated,they respawn again! I can see its minions respawning but the boss? Also from the \"Hyperion Hub of Heroism\"level forward,when you come near a Vault symbol to press \"e\" to discover them,you will find when you do they have already been discovered....but you haven't been there before! Lastly there is a side mission called\"To Arms\".In it you have to find a box and donate about 52 weapons to it. Well every time you come back to the box,you press\"e\" to open your back pack(and donate).However despite your back pack being FULL of weapons,it will tell you there are none!???? So of course there goes your donations down the drain AND any hopes of ever completing this side mission.\nOn this date there was a patch installed through Steam for the PC games. From what little I can see,there is no difference. All the items mentioned above are still extant.\nSo is this game worth your hard earned bucks on,or your parents dollars? Unless you just HAVE to have this,I would recommend backing off for a year or two. Then you not only save money but will hopefully get a game finally fixed by then.", "summary": "Welcome to Glitch City folks!", "unixReviewTime": 1414886400}

In this FIFA, you actually NEED to be able to create chances and set-up goals instead of just choosing fast team hitting the Triangle button as hard as you can letting speedy attackers fly past Defenders who just stand there and pick there nose.  In FIFA 16 you won't be able to do that ...barring exceptions as in what I call the \"cheapness of Real Madrid\".  Unfortunately, this still exists where virtually players with no skill have a chance to win if they use Real Madrid.\n\nEA is in love with this team, and makes it as though they are the greatest team on the planet.  Madrid is good, but the way just about every ball bounces their way, or how no matter the angle or range just about every shot is on target, or how they win almost every header especially ones on crosses.  The increased odds at winning by using Real Madrid makes it especially annoying when playing online how you can pick a 5 star team and play Madrid 17 out of 20x ...and no matter how much you love the game gets particularly old fast.  I REALLY wish EA would improve the online selection process where something is done where we wouldn't have to play against the same team so much.  Also, I wish EA would make it where it was easier to get a game online.  So many times I have chosen 3 - 4.5 star teams and have tried in vain to get a game.  It would be nice for those of us who don't want to pick a 5 star team every time to play with a 2 star or 1 star team even just to test and improve our skills since it is much harder to score when your players run about the speed of a dump truck rather than a greyhound.\n\nHowever, that is more on EA's online system than it is the actual gameplay of FIFA 16 which for the most part is really good compared to years past.  It is so much enjoyable to actually have players beat you on skill rather than \"cheapness\" even though it still exists but not as much as previously so I do feel it is getting better.  Cheapness being, except for what I already stated, is the ease and regularity a person can score by running down the side and continually crossing the ball in where this is there only trick.  And because the way EA FIFA is set-up, one or more of these crosses will eventually be headed into the net no matter how good you are defending/marking because FIFA enjoys defying the laws physics by having a 5'1\" striker out jump a 6'2\" defender.  Another cheap thing that I do not like the is the ease and regularity players can hit shots well well outside the box.  I can't believe, well I can seeing how many years I played, how many times I played FIFA when I'll play someone who's only \"thing\" they do in the game is hit 20-35 yard goals ...I have played games where guys have scored 3 in one game.  EA won't let you play a women's team against a men's team because they say they want to have a sense of realism ...well how realistic is it for a team to hit 2-3 25-35 yard goals a game?  And I will agree, the passing many times is off.  I'll clearly be aiming for one of my players and it will go right to an opponent.  Other times, I'll lightly press a pass button and the ball will go flying and vice versa.\n\nThat being said, this game is a lot of fun to play.  I especially enjoy the Interactive World Cup where all the teams rate at 85.  This makes it where it's skill on skill ...I love that!  I find I win more games because it's skill vs. skill instead of the annoying \"cheapness\" that will come-in during regular Seasons.  Because of FIFA 16 making more where players have to create chances FIFA 16 is one of my favorite FIFAs since FIFA 11 ...and I feel ....HOPE this means FIFA will just get better!", "summary": "it's one of the best FIFAs yet", "unixReviewTime": 1449014400}

The circular shape of the notes was ok and they were bright, better than the \"Chinese hats\" or whatever those Guitar Hero notes are, but the bright clear rectangles of Rock Band are the best in my opinion.\n\nAs far as drumming, the kick pedal notation as \"just another note\" is jarring, I did get used to it but never completely liked it.

Playing the basic songs was fine, but I found most of other things like avoiding \"poison\" notes or playing without the notes visible were much more frustrating than fun.  So I found myself staying in quick play mode more than the career.\n\nI played this game a few times but ultimately, like after playing Guitar Hero World Tour, went back to Rock Band 2.

I waited to buy one. I finally did and I'm pretty happy with it. It's nice to get Nintendo in HD. But I've also had a few issues. Here's the rundown:\n\nTHE GOOD\n\nI didn't get the appeal of the Gamepad at first. But having played it, I admit it's pretty neat. Playing a game on the Gamepad while somebody else is watching TV or while you're in bed is actually pretty fun. Not necessary, but neat.\n\nThe graphics are amazing. I'm sure PS4 and XOne will have higher graphics processing power, but I can't imagine I'd never have a need for more.\n\nThe eShop is very user friendly, easy to navigate, and downloads pretty fast. Also, Amazon and Netflix offer HD and plays well.\n\nTHE BAD\n\nThe biggest frustration with the Wii U is that it doesn't allow you to separate video and audio output into separate inputs, so if you want to connect the Wii U to external speakers it's actually quite a bit of trouble. I bought an HDMI expander that separates them and I happened to have spare HDMI and component cables, but the expander cost about $40, increasing the price of the unit.\n\nTHE VERDICT\n\nIf you have the money to spare, I definitely recommend the Wii U. There still aren't many games on it, but I'm sure more will come out. Unlike the Wii's motion controls, the Wii U doesn't revolutionize gaming and there is a very big risk that games will try to force the Gamepad in gimmicky ways.

After playing through some of it, I have to say that this title is being overshadowed and should get more publicity that it has.\n\nSTORY:\nOne of the ley aspects with any JRPG is the story.  I am happy to say that this story is easy to get into.  The people who wrote this kept the plot pretty much simple; Your character, having lost his home and his foster sister, joins the Southern forces to fight the encroaching Northern forces in a Civil War.  There are other elements involved, but that is the story in the beginning.  There are some nice twists that happen, and the hero starts to discover things about himself over the course of the game.  There are also some political and romantic twists involved as well.\n\nCHARACTERS:\nA story isn't good without supporting characters either.  I am happy to say that this story holds true to that.  No character appears to be second throughout this story.  As you go threough the story, you begin to understand who they are and learn their history.  Even Celestine, the girl with a squeaky voice, has her moments and is used to support another character who feels guilt over certain events.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThis category take a little practice.  When I first tried it, it was very complicated and I didn't understand how the magic worked (getting overwhelmed in the process).  I decided to restart my game and try it again and learned how it worked.  The second time proved more beneficial and I was able to create some very powerful characters.  I won't go into the details, but I will say that this game makes you have to think about your moves.  If you charge in, slashing crazy, you are so dead (Like I was on the first try).  Once you get used to the combat system, it is fun.  The only gripe I have is that in order to use certain skills, you need certain types of weapons.  It is possible to sheath your weapons and switch them out in combat, but it is a small hassle.\n\nGRAPHICS:\nThese are not top notch like FF13, but they are still good.  Also conversations are like those use in Tales of Vesperia's box picture scens, only you see the whole characters sting in front of a backround picture.  If not for the story, I think people would get turned off by this.  Fortunately, the story and characters catch on quickly, and this becaome something you do not mind as you play the game.\n\nOVERALL:\nGood story and characters.  Combat needs some time to get used to, but can be fun once learned.  Conversation scenes could be better, but I'm willing to ignore them for the better plot.  In the end, I was happy for the trade and wished I had known about this game sooner.  NAMCO/Bandai, you have good RPGs.

But I've become so used to \"switching on\" my aircraft that I just had to have another to replace it.\n\nSo after heavy testing of the old one to be sure it was dead, I ordered another one.\n\n.\nAfter attaching the new one, I decided to see if the old one was totally shot, or if some part of it could still be salvaged.\n\nWhen I plugged the old one back in, it worked! BOTH old & new were recognized immediately.\n\nI spent less than 5 seconds thinking about returning it, but decided to keep it for the extra switches.\n\n.\nSAITEK PROVIDES NO WAY TO REPOURPOSE (essentially - re-program) THEIR PANELS!\n\nHowever, it can be done with SPAD and FSUIPC.\n.\n\nI'm still in the process of re-assigning the switches. Once I've decided what I want them to do, I'll print an overlay with the new names.\n\nThe first two changes was to re-assign the OFF/R/L/BOTH-All rotary switch to control to the fuel selection.\n\nThe old \"GEAR UP\" lever is now \"Locked Breaks\" (down), and \"Unlocked Breaks\" (up).\n\nThat gives me a visual indicator of the parking break status, as well as a satisfying audio/tactile sensation when locking or releasing them. It beats the heck out of using a mouse to do the job.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, this is a better solution than buying a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/X-keys-USB-16-Key-Stick-for-Windows-or-Mac/dp/B000234RCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">X-keys USB 16 Key Stick for Windows or Mac</a>&nbsp;for $105.\n\n===================================================================================================\n\nUPDATE 1/28/12\nUsing the free program SPAD and FSUIPC (paywear) I was able to make the Switch panel behave much more realistically. No one else makes such, relatively, low cost sim aviation hardware. But Saitek just seems to call it a day and go home after ***barely*** getting the drivers written.\n\nSpecifically;\n - Before, when you turn the left hand knob to \"OFF\" nothing would happen. It now shuts down the engines.\n - The same goes for the fuel pump. NOW.\n - In fact, my engines can't start if the settings aren't correct.\n - The \"Gear Down/UP\" lever just sent the key \"G\" to FSX, and FSX didn't ALWAYS remember what position the gears were in. So the lever could, physically, be in the down position upon FSX startup but FSX, internally, listed it in \"gear up\" position.  Now it ALWAYS start in whatever position the physical gear lever is in.\n\nWhat I once thought of as an interesting, but largely unneeded device, I now use on every flight.\n\nPS - Don't tell Saitek but I think that it's worth a lot more, when set up properly, than what they sell it for.\n\n===================================================================================================\n\nAt the regular price I have my doubts about it's worth. ESPECIALLY using the Saitek drivers/software.\n\nSo the first thing that you have to know is DON'T use the Saitek drivers/software! DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!\n\nDON'T\n\nThe program you want is called SPAD (free software). SPAD stands for Saitek Panels Advanced Driver. It's so much better that if it didn't exist I would strongly recommend that no one buys the Switch Panel. If you did install even the newest Saitek drivers you'll have to remove them.\n\nAbout the Saitek PRO Flight Switch Panel (using the Saitek driver/software);\n1) Turning the knob on the left does nothing. Out of the box it wouldn't start up any of the planes that I tried (I only tried a couple).\n2) The switches have little effect on the aircraft that I tried it on. Only the light switches did anything noticeable. Turn off the fuel pump, avionics, & master switches while flying. No problem, everything keeps on flying. The same goes for the rotary switch on the left. Set it to OFF while flying and the plane keeps right on flying (on a couple of multi-engine planes one out of 2, or one out of 4 would shut down). (With SPAD & FSUIP *ALL* engines die when I switch it off.)\n3) The landing gear, with accompanying status lights, IS GREAT! But that alone doesn't make the Switch Panel worth buying if you use the Saitek drivers/software.\n\nSo why buy it?\nThe Saitek PRO Flight Switch Panel *** with the right software *** can do a lot to make flying on a sim much more enjoyable.\n\n1) SPAD can join the 3 main Saitek panel into a cohesive whole. If you have the Pro Flight Radio Panel and this one you can make the \"START\" setting start 4 engines ENDIVIDUALY, and in whatever order you want. You use the top left hand Com/Nav switches to select the engine to start and then turn the switch from \"BOTH/ALL\" to START (and then back, of course). I have the CH Products Eclipse Yoke. On the right side (front) are 2 switches. Left switch up to select engine #1. Down to select engine #2. Right Switch up to select engine #3. Down to select engine #4.\n\n2) Using SPAD and FSUIP (payware) you CAN program the switches. Basically you open FSUIP (in the Add-ons tab) and SPAD. You then select the switch you want to modify (from within SPAD) on the Switch Panel and send a virtual joystick key to FSUIP. You can choose up to 32 virtual joystick keys thru SPAD.\n\nStarting up a plane from a cold cockpit is a lot more fun than just taking off and landing, it's a blast! And THAT is why I recommend the Switch Panel.\n\nThe only caveat to the whole thing is in the way that the flight sims are set up. There is no logic tree to flight sims regarding how you can, and have to, use them. A keyboard is the basic starting place and everything else after that is just an add-on to the keyboard.

I have been gaming for well over 15 years and have a career in technical support so I have pretty high expectations when I spend a lot of money for a game add-on.\n\nThis was my first wheel due to the value, guaranteed GT5 support, and the countless recommendations.  My lap times went up (bad) by 5 seconds on average (spent one week getting used to it).  This is normal, and it takes several weeks to get your times back.  Once you get to that point you can regularly achieve faster times than a controller.  I have to mention that when I tried the Thrustmaster F430 FFB (not the cockpit version) my lap times matched the controller on the third lap (impressive).\n\nPRO'S\n- value, very affordable for what you get\n- loaded with features like an RA tuning wheel and full button re-mapping in GT5\n(Set brake balance, traction control, abs, vsc on the fly, IDEAL for online shuffle races.)\n- excellent pedals\n- wheel felt nice\n- very strong forcefeedback (FFB)\n- Logitech is a trusted brand and has decent customer support\n- Table mount was pretty sturdy and nicely designed (I have a very thin desk)\n- Quality of the material was better than average\n\nCON'S\n- The paddle shifters were small, had no tactile feel, I often missed shifts, and it limits you from using other grip locations on the wheel.  TOTAL DEAL BREAKER FOR ME!\n- I have tried several wheels and I spun out a lot more with this one (takes practice)\n- Force Feedback at the lowest setting prevents using the shifter because it takes two hands to steer\n- Force Feedback can knock you off your line on straightaways, the software sort of checks to see if you're holding onto the wheel.  It takes some getting used to\n- I'd rather have the shifter detach so that I can mount it somewhere else\n- ONE year warranty, competition offers much longer warranties\n\nSUMMARY:\nI feel that most people will be very happy with this wheel.  Enthusiasts are more than likely going to upgrade to the G27, Fanatec GT3 (German based company with known support issues.  The sales team doesn't go out of their way with promotions or even free shipping, so they won't earn my business), or Thustmaster T500 wheels within a year.  You get what you pay for and the Thrustmaster T500 is the only 100% PS3 compatible wheel that will meet everyone's needs, other than being expensive.\n\nI'll be reviewing the G27 which is next on my list.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "05 19, 2012", "summary": "a little over rated, well done, but not for me on a PS3 with GT5", "unixReviewTime": 1337385600}

As technology as advanced, the quality of these types of video games has exploded.  BioWare has become the industry leader making these games.

That means creating a historical timeline of events similar to what Marvel has done with their movies such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Captain-America-The-First-Avenger/dp/B005ZCXPP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Captain America: The First Avenger</a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Guardians-of-the-Galaxy/dp/B00OBW0IUU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Guardians of the Galaxy</a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Incredible-Hulk/dp/B001IAME78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Incredible Hulk</a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Iron-Man/dp/B001FD5KJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Iron Man</a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Marvel-s-The-Avengers-HD/dp/B0099RFVXQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Marvel's The Avengers [HD</a>], & Thor so far.  However, abundantly delevered what video gamers want in 2009.\n\nThe world of Thedas {Dragon Age} is rich in historical and character depth.  Most importantly the game has inspires gamers to spend hundreds of hours in playtime by replaying the game with different characters and making different choices.  Participants are able to choose different species for their protagonist and different unique histories and starting points for each character history.  The game has myriad endings that can easily be fundamentally different from each other instead of a few minor differences.\n\nDespite all of these choices, the main and side stories lead the audience to love and care for the characters they have developed.  We want them to succeed and dream of choices we will make in the next mission the next time we play.  As described the entire game is implicitly compelling in myriad ways.  There is action, adventure, drama, and especially romance.  All of these elements help the game appeal to a wide variety of sapients and attract new gamers to grow the niche further.\n\nObsidian, is an absolutely, abundantly, and indomitably outstanding video game producing studio.  In the beginning, they were the ones to inspire BioWare to delve deeper into this genre of video games.  However, seemingly the size of their company currently limits development of new video games.\n\nBethesda is apparently prohibitively fearful of allowing their audience to explore romantic drama in the stories of their own video games.  Good examples of this are The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Legendary Edition & The Elder Scrolls Online Imperial Edition [Online Game Code].  However, their products are similar with interactive stories and dynamic stories that change the game based upon the participant's choices.\n\nAtlus seems to understand how to write interactive stories with romance, such as Catherine - Playstation 3 which serves more as an erotic video game and abundantly defines why parents should pay attention to the ESRB rating of video games.  I am unsure what is keeping them from delving further with more substantive fantasy stories.\n\nTelltale games has their video game adaptation of The Walking Dead: The Complete First Season - PlayStation 4 & The Walking Dead: Season 2 - PlayStation 4 however similar to Bethesda their interactive story so far has been without any romantic drama;  Of course, Telltale has the valid excuse of the Survival Horror genre being difficult to offer romantic options.\n\nAccording to the initial product description Telltale's The Wolf Among Us breaks that mold and does have romantic options in their interactive and dynamic story.  As a rabid fanboy of this genre, I choose to support any video game maker exploring it the way I want.  Therefore I preordered the game and I look forward to playing it in a few days.  I pray and hope that it abundantly tides me over until Dragon Age Inquisition - PlayStation 4 Deluxe Edition arrives.\n\nAs a quality game Dragon Age Origins: Ultimate Edition - Playstation 3 is still felicitously worth buying even five years after its initial release.  Fans of interactive stories should easily accept the dated graphics to experience the outstanding story of the game.  I suspect that the game will be worth playing for years in the future.  Therefore I hope that BioWare actually chooses to reopen work on Dragon Age Origins: Ultimate Edition - Playstation 3 and offer a remake for the Playstation 4.  There is plenty of opportunity to explore Ferelden further even if the continuation involves creating a new protagonist from the initial protagonist's family legacy.", "summary": "Radiantly Brilliant Choose Your Own Adventure Fantasy Video Game", "unixReviewTime": 1386460800}

Everything else is somehow worse.\n\nThe biggest problem with this game is that it forces you to complete an entire multiple stage mission without being able to save after any part of it. I completed the first part of mission #1 and was unable to save after this stage which should have been a save checkpoint. Once I completed this part, I promptly got shot in the head on the (harder) second part of mission #1 and was forced to try the entire mission over.\n\nThe aming with any of the guns is absolutely horrible as well. The orders you can give to your teammates is restricted to covering fire, taking point, throwing grenades or coming back to your position. Your team also won't engage any enemy they see on their own either without you firing or directing them to provide covering fire.\n\nOrdinarily, an enhanced enemy AI would be a good thing, but even during the first mission, the enhanced AI is a disaster. I have yet to have been wounded, I simply get shot in the head and die immediately. I'm not getting close to the enemy either and am prone on the ground behind foliage, yet I get shot in the head during a firefight every time. This doesn't make any sense.\n\nAlso, what made the original Ghost Recon unique has been taken out of this game.

But it has a lot of dumb things which make this game a rough 3.5 for me. The Steve Austin Showcase Mode is actually really good. Especially if you're an old-school wrestling fan.\n\nLet explain some of the issues I've encountered SO FAR. First, the submission system is trash. Submitting the A.I is damn-near impossible and getting submitted is way too easy. It's honestly a shame too, because of all the new submissions they added. Thankfully the gameplay is WAY BETTER than last year's by far. But there's these little things in the gameplay which really make it feel underwhelming. Why do we have a 5 second neck wrench in a game where we can bounce people off the ring apron, throw them over the announce table, and drop them on the barricade. We can do all this epic s***, but then we put them in a useless 5 second neck wrench?? WTF. And I don't even hate the realistic gameplay, unlike many people who wish they'd just remaster HCTP.\n\nAnother thing is the bugs. There are a LOT of bugs in this game. Thankfully they aren't consistent, but when they do happen they can really break the great immersion this game gives you. Some I've noticed so far:\n\nAudio glitches during Showcase mode cutscenes\nCharacters glitching out of place during matches (rare)\nSome odd animations\nFacial expressions looking peculiar during matches\n\nIt's just a shame the there's so many little things which stop this game from being a 5 star wrestling game. But still, the creation suit is amazing. Showcase mode is really good this year, and the new characters, moves, and animations make this game worth your money. I have yet to test out MyCareer Mode, but I've heard pretty positive things so far. I have a feeling that this game is going to get a lot of mixed reviews, so I will just say this-- you have to play it yourself to see if it's for you or not. Go on YouTube and watch gameplay videos that show off the creation suit and watch tuns of gameplay. Then, if you feel like you like it, give it a chance and rent it.

Becoming a huge seller on the Playstation 2 by offering some dynamic platforming, weapons combat and puzzles.  When the Playstation 3 dropped down Insomniac games shifted focus from Ratchet and Clank and first gave us Resistance: Fall of Man.  A year into the PS3's life, however, and Insomniac Game brought back Ratchet and Clank with a whole new story and adventure.  Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction may be the best one in the series.\n\nThings are looking normal for our heroes who have saved the galaxy countless times.  Ratchet and Clank are just fixing a vehicle when they get a call from the Planetary Defense Center.  The city of Metropolis is under attack by an army that is being led by the evil Emperor Tachyon.  He's come to Metropolis for only one reason: To find and eradicate Ratchet--the last of the Lombax species.  And he's willing to level entire cities to do it.  Once Ratchet and Clank barely escape their quest takes them across the galaxy looking for the secrets of the past.  Why does Tachyon want to eliminate the Lombaxes?  And what was the Lombax secret?  The story, by all accounts, is much more heavily character focused than the other games which came before it.  In particular, you'll learn a lot more about Ratchet than you have in other games.  It makes for a more personal story and it's an exciting one.  It's filled with familiar characters and a few new ones.  It's also humorous in every way but also much more mature than most people really give it credit for.  There's a lot more heart in this story and makes a much more distinct connection with its characters.\n\nThat being said, the only real issue with the story is that Tachyon just isn't an interesting character.  This is especially sad considering how present Dr. Nefarious was in Up Your Arsenal.  You'll rarely see what's going on for Tachyon or what he's doing.  He doesn't quite feel as absent as Drek does in the first one, but you rarely get the sense that Tachyon is really doing anything.  In some ways that's perfectly fine as the story going on with Ratchet and Clank is ultimately more satisfying and interesting than any game in the series thus far.  It more than makes up for the lack of focus on Tachyon because it keeps the focus on the main characters and really developing them.  It makes the story by far the most rewarding in the series.\n\nRatchet and Clank has had a familiar formula for years and that doesn't change with Tools of Destruction.  Those familiar with any of the other games in the series will know what to expect.  There's a lot of running, jumping and blowing things up.  You'll find yourself collecting bolts aplenty to buy new weapons and armor.  There's not much here you haven't seen.  The weapons are certainly very fascinating, however.  There are some nice things here such as the new Tornado Launcher or being able to place down a swarm that will kill off the bad guys.  Like Up Your Arsenal each weapon is constantly leveling up.  What's new, however, is that you will not just gain bolts but Raritanium.  While Raritanium is nothing new to Ratchet and Clank, here it's actually used to purchase perks for your weapons such as more ammo, longer range or more power.  Each weapon also has a master perk that adds a new element.  For instance, the Fusion Bomb will have a master upgrade that allows each bomb to explode into a smaller set of bombs that may damage other enemies in the area.  Each weapon goes through five levels and once they hit level five they change into a totally different weapon.\n\nThere are other editions, however.  You not only have weapons, but also devices that aren't always weapons but rather just things to help distract enemies.  The devices are usually independent of Ratchet.  For instance, you can use the Groovitron to make enemies dance in place, or use a Leech Bomb to drain their health.  You might not always need devices, but they add variety to the game.\n\nThere is also a lot of space combat where you'll fly on rails and aim at various targets.  Usually these segments end with a boss fight as well.  None of these moments are challenging, however.  Which may be something about the game overall.  The first three Ratchet and Clank games were quite the challenge from time to time but Future: Tools if Destruction is a relatively simple game by comparison.  Your nanotech increases a lot easier than it did in the previous games.  But the most strange thing is that you'll rarely (if ever) find yourself short on bolts.  In previous games, grinding for bolts was a must, but in Future: Tools of Destruction you'll find you almost always have the right number of bolts.  And if you don't, it's never detrimental to buy a new weapon as your old ones will level up quite quickly and never be useless.  Your default weapons will still be enough to hold you over at the end.  But even then, you'll end up getting enough bolts almost purely by accident.  Bolts are everywhere, in large quantities and never stop coming.  You'll also find jackpot crates that double bolts.  Even if you manage to be having some trouble in Future: Tools of Destruction your nanotech will increase enough times that you'll eventually be able to dominate your foes purely based off the fact that you have too much health to be taken down.\n\nThat's not to say it doesn't have its challenging moments.  It's only to say that eventually you'll succeed because the game has fewer limitations than previous games.  Your health is always restored when you go to a weapon shop, for instance, and sometimes there's one sitting right next to you in major battles.\n\nAt the very least Future: Tools of Destruction does have some well designed areas, although it's a lot more linear than the other games.  For instance, in previous games you had various paths you could take the moment you touched down, but Future: Tools of Destruction is much more about making sure you progress through the games story.  Meaning that instead of being able to start off by going down three different paths only to find easy shortcuts back to your ship, you often only have one path to take to your next goal, which is never a mystery to you.  That's okay by me, as many of the game's locales are absolutely huge and populated with plenty of things to do such as puzzles, enemies aplenty and gold bolts to collect off the beaten path.  The feeling of exploration is still there, it's just that the various \"missions\" can't be done in nearly any order like previous games.\n\nProduction wise, Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction may be the best the PS3 has to offer.  Despite originally releasing in 2007, the game still looks a lot better than you'd expect it to.  The cartoon like quality really helps a lot of the characters pop with detail.  It also helps that so much of the environments are colorful.  There's a lot of life in Ratchet and Clank and that really helps the game seem much bigger and more epic than it actually is.  In particular, the game's opening moments in Metropolis are some of the most amazing you'll see in the series.  But perhaps the most amazing thing is how well animated everything is in the game's various pre-rendered cutscenes or even in game.  There's a lot of detail and a lot of chaos that can go on.  And it rarely slows down when things happen such as enemies populating the screen or bolts flying around everywhere.\n\nThe only real hiccup is that while the in game engine never buckles, the pre-rendered cutscenes sometimes do.  Sometimes the audio gets a little wonky and the actual speech doesn't match up with the lip movements.  This is actually rather sad as the voice acting and writing you see here is some of the best in the series.  So when a pre-rendered scene starts to buckle it's a little sad.  The animations and voice acting aren't just some of the best in the series, but some of the best I've ever seen of any game.\n\nMusically, Future: Tools of Destruction may have the best music in the series.  It's not quite as \"mechanical\" as some of the other tunes, but there are moments that much more emotionally investing and moments where the music really compliments the environments a lot.  It's a pretty amazing soundtrack overall, topped off by some fantastic sound effects.  Everything about the production values comes forth to make a really solid package.  One of the best uses of technology on the system you're likely to see.  If anything, the game is always running A LOT of things, making me wish that it could be installed instead of everything always constantly being read from the disk.  It's quite clear Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction is running A LOT of stuff and you'll hear it reading from the disc constantly.\n\nOverall, Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction is one of the best in the series.  It's got such an engrossing story and gameplay that's it's hard not to like it.  It's an ambitious game technologically that really showcases--even now--just what video games can be with the right art design and graphical prowess in place.  If you're a fan of Ratchet and Clank then Future: Tools of Destruction should not be missed.", "summary": "When the Galaxy Needs a Hero", "unixReviewTime": 1352160000}

You may catch lots of bacteria if she was doing it in real life.  Instead of cool looking puzzle rooms, you have single room with filthy decoration.  When I play, I end up feeling nausea.

Here she spends lots of time shooting people in the head and being a victim.  It is very NOT exciting.  Fortunately the sequel for PS4 where she goes to the psychiatrist is not for PS3.

Instead, to express beauty there are millions of different ways.  Trilogy was beautiful. Climbing that beautiful cliff to watch an impressive sculpture in Thailand in Tomb Raider Underworld was just amazing.

I remember when I used to shovel quarters into the machines to play this (when that was still a thing).  I picked this game up at a used game store thinking I'd probably get a lot of use out of it, but it was disappointing.\n\nFirst, (like other reviewers have said), the controls are stupid.  I was hoping I'd be able to play like a classic game with the controller sideways, but instead you have to point the wii mote at the TV screen.  You have to have really steady control for that and it was just a stupid way to go for this game.\n\nSecond, I expected that I'd be able to do multiplayer split-screen with my kids or whoever, but on multiplayer you only get one screen and you play together.\n\nThen, there are all the bubbles that are floating past while you're playing and if you hit them they do different things.  Didn't really care about that.\n\nNot that it's a big deal to me because when I was playing I tuned it out and just focused on the bubbles, but there are really annoying graphics moving around in the background.\n\nIt's okay as Bust-a-Move, but there are so many annoying things about it.  I think it would have been better if they had just remastered the SNES version and given us the classic style of control, rather than trying to make it fancy.", "summary": "Annoying controlls - not worth it", "unixReviewTime": 1522281600}

Two issues keep this from getting a 5-star review.  The first is that the charging clip is so snug and small that when you want to remove it from the controller, you have to pry it or wiggle it, which means you're putting undue stress on the charging port in the controller (enough to make it slightly loose).  Speaking of the clip being snug, you will not be able to keep any silicone controller covers/skins on it with the charging clip unless you cut/shove a part of the silicone off to let the clip slide on (or you bend the charging port a bit to force the clip on on top of a silicone cover).  The second is that because the clip has such a small surface area, it's easy to mis-align it on the dock, meaning that it won't charge until you wiggle the controller around to get it seated correctly.\n\nI had an issue when I first started using it where the front charger refused to charge a new controller that was completely dead.  I had to give that controller about 30 minutes of charge using a regular USB cable, replace it with the charging clip from Nyko, then drop it onto the charger, after which point it started charging.  I guess there's not enough power going through the Nyko charger to bring back a fully drained controller.\n\nThe charging station takes quite a significant amount of space compared to just having a couple of controllers lying around.  The extra space in the front/back makes it take the same length as stacking three controllers in a row, so keep that in mind.\n\nThey \"Nyko\" logo never turns off so there is always a white LED light on.\n\nThe controllers seem to take the initial charge and turn off when full, but as far as I can tell, the dock won't start charging the controllers again until your re-seat it.  This means that if you leave the controller for a full month on the dock, by the time you pick it up the batteries will have discharged and you won't have a full charge.  Perhaps it is turning on and charging the controllers as their batteries get low, but I haven't caught/seen it happen.  I've only been using it for a couple weeks so I may update this review in a month after leaving one controller untouched to confirm whether or not it recharges unused controllers.\n\nOverall, it's a great idea that could have been executed better.

Taking the formula of the original game and upping the ante and adding some depth, Geometry Wars: Galaxies offers unlockable planets and some nice multiplayer modes as well, while still offering the same brand of addicting gameplay that made the game so great in the first place.  You can either control your ship using the face buttons of the DS to manuver and shoot, or you can use the stylus and touch screen to fire.  Using the touch screen provides a great deal of accuracy as you're caught up in all the chaos, but you still need to use the D-pad to manuver, which can be kind of hard on the hands.  Actually, with all the frantic moments that come in Geometry Wars, you're fingers might get pretty sore.  That aside, there is plenty of addicting fun to be had here, and there is plenty to do as well.  In addition to unlocking a side variety of planets, the original never-ending game itself, Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved, is also included here as well, as are some fine multiplayer options.  If there are any downsides to Geometry Wars: Galaxies, it's that the game suffers from a bit of slowdown when the action gets frantic, and that there is no online multiplayer either.

Singer", "reviewText": "This is a game that I was skeptical of at first. Like you probably already know, this is an RPG-style game with battles taking place upon a square grid filled with gems and other objects, and battle takes place Bejeweled-style, with players taking turns collecting different colored mana for spells, inflicting damage, and earning gold and experience.\n\nThis sounds a little strange, but by the end of your first battle you should be stacking up huge combos and strategizing several turns ahead. However, the difficulty is staggering. Your opponents almost always outmatch you, and when pieces drop from above, they almost always give your opponent a lucky combination. This might turn some gamers off, but depending on what kind of gamer you are, you'll either replay certain recently completed quests for experience griding, or throw your DS in frustration.\n\nYou create your own custom character at the start of the game. You have a common choice of character classes (Knight, Warrior, Wizard, Druid), which play very differently, but the story is the same no matter which you choose. You choose your character's portrait (Two male and two female choices for each class), give him/her a name (Or let the game give your character a random name), and let the adventuring begin. The story of the game is underwhelming, and you'll find yourself skipping conversations early on. Quests are simple \"go here and battle this person\" affairs as well.\n\nBut you'll gladly keep playing for the sake of customizing your Citadel (A palace that you build where you can forge items, keep captive enemies and learn spells from them, and do various other things), collecting gear for your character, or simply enjoying the addictive puzzle combat.\n\nHere are my overall reviews (1 to 5):\n\nGameplay: 4 (1 point taken down for difficulty)\nStory: 3\nGraphics and Sound: 3 (The track played during battle gets old FAST, but the graphics are nice enough)\nValue: 5 (This game is epic in size.

You really need to spend time finding out what kind of mech works for you. That does indeed take some time and effort, but all the parts to build a decent mech are all right there. Sure, there are some advanced parts that you can aquire through the Marketplace, playing through the storyline, or bidding on in the auction, but they aren't anything spectacular. This game is not for people who want to plop in a game disk, find the rocket launcher, and get 30 kills.\n\nI really enjoy this game, it isn't as fast paced as the MechAssault games are, but the customization is so much fun. Anyone willing to spend the time  to tweak their mech just right to fit them is going to have lots of fun with this game. I personally love my little hovercraft mech with 4 pile weapons and a machine gun on it. It is fast, maneuverable, and can eliminate almost any mech with just two hits. Throw an NA jammer on it during multiplayer games and come up behind the commander mech and take him out before he even knows you're there.\n\nThis game is really fun, with amazing graphics, but it does take some time to get into and isn't for those who like to jump right in and expect to be good at it right away.", "summary": "What MechAssault 2 Should have Been", "unixReviewTime": 1160870400}

I am just writing an initial review for the game based on what I have played so far.\n\nSo far I like what I see. I honestly didn't expect too much more then MW2 because common, how advanced can the graphics get and how \"futuristic\" can you get with a game thats entitled MODERN WARFARE. If you get any more into it you might as well be going sci-fi because the weapons of today haven't changed much since the last game.\n\nThe graphics are good, and maybe a tad bit better then MW2, but honestly how much further can we go without a brand new gaming platform? I don't think there's any more \"HD\" you can go without playing this on a PS3, and thats even pushing it. If you want something that is going to blow you completely away in regards to graphics then wait for the next \"gaming consol of tomorrow\" because honestly we are at the platforms graphic capacity (NOT the WiiU because that won't be graphic intensive).\n\nThe campaign is a continuation of the first two games, so if you haven't played them then you probably should. I got lucky and jumped into the 2nd modern warfare without playing the 1st, but was still a tad lost; but they really don't try to brief you on anything that happened before hand in this game. Its either you know or you don't. So far playing on regular it isn't that difficult, but I'm only doing it on regular so I can probably bet that when I up the difficulty, it will most certainly become harder. I do enjoy how your team mates kill the enemies and really do try to push the objective instead of \"blindly firing\" (and by this i mean attempting to fire at the enemy but always missing) as they have in past games.\n\nThe guns are pretty much the same with a few new guns and additions. There's a lot of complaints about this but honestly what do you expect? It's like I said before, if they tried to make up a gun it would cross the line of being a modern game about modern warfare into sci-fi and then you would blast it even further so I like where it's at now. The guns are more customizible and now you can even level up your weapons so it encourages you to favor one weapon over others. This can be good or bad but I prefer it because I like to master one gun and then move to the next.\n\nMultiplayer always has its quirks, but thats common over almost every game out there (Halo, MW, MW1 etc). Right now people that have no life are the highest levels, but for the common joe like me with a job and a life only play when we want, and seemed to get paird up with equals, and even if you are jesus of the video game world, you'll start off as the lowest level until you rank up so just wait a week or so and people will be probably about at their rankings as they were in MW2. That Jesus of the video game who owned you last week will be a completely different level by then and you'll probably never face him again, its all part of playing a brand new game right at launch.\n\nIt's fairly easy to level up but i did find it a little difficult with the three profiles you are given at the start because they are so limited. It's really not a big deal though and you'll quickly be able to customize your own profile once you level up which they have made pretty easy.\n\nFor those that complain that there are little children playing cussing, singing and playing loud music...you'll never get away from it. There will always be an annoying little brat that thinks he's better then you, calling you a fa* and probably touching themselves. Its the nature of the game and really any game and shouldn't be factored into a review of the game itself. If you don't want to be bothered by that sort of thing then don't play multiplayer and just play with your friends on split screen.\n\nI will update this as I find out and play more of the game, cause honestly there's not much I can put having only played about 4-5 hours worth after work.

Not because I'm lazy, but I don't think the technology is quite to the level it needs to be at to have an above-average experience. We have the Dance Central games, the Kinect Adventures, and the Hip-Hop Experience; all of which have pretty good detection controls and are more accurate than not in reading movements. Yet despite all the lighting adjustments and re-calibrations, there are still times where movements are erroneously detected or not detected at all.\n\nThis is where creatively ambitious games like \"Rise of Nightmares\" are short-changed. The movements are mostly accurately detected, but then there are times when you get stuck in a corner, trying to escape by furiously twisting your shoulders with your one foot behind you while the camera stubbornly continues to bump against the wall. Or when fighting the final boss, you get wedged up in a cliff crevice that prevents your electric fireballs from reaching the boss's hit box.\n\nBut the occasional frustration brought by the Kinect controls thankfully did not overshadow what I found to be a fun little macabre adventure. The eerie environments and mutilated enemies are varied and very well done. There are classic horror elements mixed with science-fiction fantasy. I saw quite a few similarities in plot and design between this game and Sega's earlier zombie games such as House of the Dead and Zombie Revenge. The characters you encounter range from the creepy yet intriguing to walking clich&eacute;s. The story is ridiculous and, at times, outright silly (think man's head on Chihuahuas body) and seems to just continue on unraveling with even more outrageous elements the farther you get. There are some clever moments where it makes you think the game is about to end with a climactic scene, but then throws you into yet another stage. The final boss battle is so removed from the original premise that it feels like they might've gone a bit too far into the absurd. I felt like I was in some weird dimension that was a hodgepodge of Alice in Wonderland, Dune, Tremors, and Street Fighter(!).\n\nBut I would be lying if I said it wasn't fun. Apart from punching and kicking your undead foes, you also get lots of fun little weapons to slice and dice them. There are lots of 'jump' moments too that require you to jump back or side to side to avoid spikes, saws, and spears coming at you.\n\nMy play-through lasted about 3.5 hours.

As of this review I have played for 2+ weeks including the pre-release.\n\nBelow are my updated impressions of the game and some of the features I was most excited to try.\n\nMultiple Classes: The Classes in ARR are typical of most fantasy mmo's.  You have the usual heal, tank, dps classes, nothing really new there.  The new thing is that after reaching level 10 and completing your level 10 class quest you can learn new classes and switch between them at will.  In addition you can carryover some select abilities from the classes.  A refreshing and innovative idea for dealing with the traditional trinity of heals, dps, and tank rolls.\n\nOn the negative side, if you really think this through you will see that in the end with this feature of class switching and merging we all become significantly less special snowflakes.  Need a healer?  Mike can tank, heal and dps.  Need a Tank?  Jane can tank, heal and dps.  Need dps?  Dave can tank, heal, and dps.... Everyone can do everything.  No one is specialized or special anymore.  Is this a bad thing?  Depends on how you look at it.  It certainly allows for a lot more game leveling time that's for sure.  In the end I think it's worth it.  Having one toon to play with instead of having to manage alts if I want a change of play style makes it worth it.  I like this and it will make playing games where you need alts for a different play style and gear/looks feel outdated.  It also makes grouping easier.\n\nCombat:  It is slower than what you will have been used to with other MMO's but they have speeded it up a bit since beta.  It's not a game breaker now but it is amazingly repetitive.  Basically each class has 2 or 3 abilities and you just rotate between them.  New abilities are far and few between mostly the ones you have at level 15 will be your classes go-to abilities for the rest of your gaming life in ARR.  If, like me, you find the ability sound effects annoying it could be problematic because you will be hearing them for hours and hours.\n\nMobs do not drop loot in this game just the occasional crafting component.  I really miss the excitement of wondering if something special will drop.  It's also sad that everyone at low levels looks the same as they all have the same vender or crafted gear.  *Dye is available if you look up on the net where to find the dye quest.\n\nThe game is in serious need of an in-game guide.  You will find yourself spending time in your browser doing research for some very simple basic things.  Like how to leave a party, where do you find the stuff to do weaving, where can I find any gatherable resource, what and where is materia?  Just about everything you can think of will not be answered in game or on the official website.  The website in Japanese is probably great, in English...not so much.  I think this language difference is the cause of a lot of the game problems but can't be sure.  There are some pop-up in game messages with information but once they are dismissed you cannot call them back up for reference.  I'm pretty sure I missed some important ones that popped up in the middle of a dungeon run, probably the materia one.\n\nCrafting:  Leveling each individual craft and gathering skill in ARR is similar to leveling a class in terms of time and effort.  Personally I think this is a great thing.  I have always believed that leveling crafting should be a significant time commitment but \"significant time commitment\" should not mean monotonous and needlessly fiddly.  (Oh and don't forget obtuse.  The whole game is obtuse mind you but the crafting features attain a supreme peak of obtuseness.)  At first I was excited to see I could learn all of the crafts but you will discover pretty quickly that the shear time commitment necessary to level even one makes tackling more than one at once challenging.  Leveling a gathering skill in wow takes hours, in ARR it will take a week or so of average game play time possibly much more.  That said, wow crafting is not particularly useful in the long run.  Possibly ARR's will be well worth the time in terms of how it effects your gameplay, abilities and toon income.  At any rate, be forewarned that crafting will not be a simple learn as you go process.  It will take quite a bit of devoted playtime sitting clicking around to make one piece at a time, or in the case of gathering running in circles of fast re-spawning nodes for, literally, hundreds of hours.  Also, you cannot craft all day there is a limited amount of crafting you can do every day, it accumulates to a cap I believe.  I found the whole process pretty tedious.\n\nRegarding gathering, for those of us that love wandering out in an mmo landscape and gathering resources while we quest or explore.  This is not possible in ARR.  You cannot stop to gather-ye-rosebuds while you are out and about questing because A) the gathering nodes, disappointingly, are not scattered all over the world, and B) to even see the gatherable nodes you need to activate an ability that can only be active if you are in your `gathering mode', a mode that has no combat abilities and a completely different stat and gear set.  In ARR you craft OR gather OR quest/play.  You have to choose one at a time, which is a big deal to me.  I really hate this game mechanic.  It's my biggest complaint.\n\nThe game is pretty but heavily instanced with small zones.  It is not explorer friendly and the instancing completely breaks game emersion.  If you like adventuring in the daylight keep in mind there is a 70 min day/night cycle.\n\nThe User Interface.  You can move most of the UI elements around but the elements themselves are not particularly attractive or usefully presented.  On the whole I would describe it as clunky and outdated.\n\nThe mini map feature is a bit of a mess and the mini-map itself is way too tiny.  There is another auxiliary map you can pull up.  Between the two maps you should be ok 80% of the time but you won't have a lot of screen space left and you will have to do quite a bit of constant fiddling with them to see what you need to see.  Also, ATM gold spamming has taken over the general chat channels so it is not really possible to talk in general chat to ask questions.\n\nThe 3 Dungeons I participated in were not much to look at.  Nothing new and the environments just didn't grab me.  Not bad but not great.  They remind me of the old wow instances only a bit shorter.\n\nPublic events called Lore's, are 1 stage escort or kill all these mobs type things.  They pop up quite often and are not story driven to my knowledge.  When I think public quests I remember the 3 stage ones in Warhammer Online where npc's ran up to you, interacted with your character, interacted with the environment and changed the world around you.  They really pulled you into whatever situation the npc was into.  This is not the case in ARR and I usually ignored them after doing them once.\n\nThere are silent cut-scenes throughout the game.  It's strange that they did not add voice-overs.  It's annoying to have to keep clicking through page after page of npc subtitles. In general you will have to click through 4-8 text panels to turn in and accept a quest.  Gets to be a bit much pretty quickly.\n\nIn summery, I love the ideas the developers had for ARR, and they did include them in the game but I really hate HOW they included them.\n\nTime to learn crafting equal to time to level. Fantastic!  Making it repetitive and incredibly fiddly and tedious?  Hated it.\n\nPublic Events.  Yes love these.  Making them simple kill 10 mobs jobbies?  I'll Pass.\n\nMultiple Classes?  Great! All Wins here in my opinion.\n\n3 Kinds of Gathering?  Wonderful!  Making me run in circles in tiny areas of the map for specific components?  Hate it.\n\nMany varieties of crafting?  Love it.  Giving them tons of daily's and making the UI inscrutable and clunky?  Not so much loving it now.\n\nBeautifully rendered world?  Honestly it's just ok to me, the standard asian market mmo fare.  Making it so that I have to hit a load screen all the time to see it?  It ends up feeling like a series of small rooms.  A huge disappointment.\n\nA Complex world with gated features?  Im ok to good with that.  Making it so that I have to search the Internet to get past the gate?  This is a big no no.\n\nI believe the rave reviews on amazon are the result of too many people not having enough variety in new MMO's.  it's a nice game but not a 5 star game because while ARR has a some great features it has some big drawbacks as well. With the slow repetitive combat, heavily instanced world, no loot, no open world gathering. It's just not my cup of tea.  I love their ideas but found their implementation of them damned annoying.  It's just so so repetitive and most of your time is spent running from point A to point B to do then turn in quests.  80% running and 20% playing.\n\nMy advice?  Check the reviews on MMORPG gaming sites for a more balanced view of the game.  The reviews here are too invested, for some reason I can't imagine, in seeing this game sell well.", "summary": "Know your play style before hitting the buy button", "unixReviewTime": 1377561600}

I wasn't thrilled about this, but it was included at no cost. The songs mentioned on the back of the box range from insipid to trite.

You can plug it in, set up your account and go!\n\n- A great online store, that allows the option of purchasing download-able PS3 games and others straight from Sony.\n\n- Wireless controllers, that connect to the system for charging via USB cord mean that you don't have to sit so close to the television.\n\n- If you are a Netflix junkie like myself, you will be pleased to know they offer the instant streaming feature through the console. (A Roku player which is a device that does almost nothing but Netflix streaming costs around $100.00 by itself and can boast none of these other great features.)\n\n- It's a blue ray and DVD player and not a half bad one at that.\n\n- It has USB ports that support playing/storing movies or music via flash drive.\n\nThese are what I thought of off the top of my head. I couldn't be more pleased with the product, and though I would like to see more interesting games come out for the system, I won't be too disappointed if all I can use it for is a bluerayplayer/Wi-Fi/PS1/Netflix device.

This is another fine point-and-click adventure game on the DS. After just beating this game I'd have to say that although Trace Memory isn't perfect, I'm still thoroughly satisfied. Let's find out why...\n\nGraphics (score 9/10): Graphics are pretty good. The in-game environment you explore is fully 3-d, and looks fine aside from the occasionally noticeable pixelation (but seriously, it's hardly noticeable). In-game character portraits appear whenever there is dialogue, and they, too, look pretty good. My only complaint is that cutscenes aren't really fully animated. They look more like flashes of still images and minimal animation. Perhaps this was done to convey mood, but I'm not really sure.\n\nMusic (score 8/10): Music is well done and seems to fit the context well. However, there doesn't seem to be much of it. I might be wrong, but I think I could count the number of music tracks on one hand. Not that it really matters; there are not that many different locations in the game, and the music suits these locations well.\n\nCharacters (score 8/10): The characters (of which there aren't that many) are handled well. This game isn't really about character interaction though. Really, your only main characters are Ashley and \"D\" (a ghost boy). There are other characters as well, but Ashley and D are given the most development. The only thing that bothers me is that Ashley seems to be a bit stupid at times. What I mean is that she seems to take a bit longer to figure something out that already seems obvious to me, and this holds true for both the puzzles and the story elements. Still, it's really not that bad, just a little annoying. I must also note that I'm glad the game developers decided to add D as a character; they could've had Ashley explore alone, which wouldn't have provided the kind of rapport that makes this game more interesting. So, good job developers!\n\nStory (score 10/10): The story's where this game really shines. It is quite suspenseful, and will keep you wanting to play just to figure out more. You start off as main character Ashley who has received a message from her father telling her to go to Blood Edward Island and meet him. Of course he's not there, so Ashley sets off to find him, bumping into the ghost boy, D, along the way. And I'm not giving away anything else. Just know that the story is excellent.\n\nGameplay (score 8/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me. The controls all work fairly well, and the game does a good job of guiding you along to the next destination and giving you proper hints to solve the puzzles with. My only complaint is that you often cannot pick up something until Ashley finds out what she needs it for later. This is mildly annoying, but doesn't cripple gameplay in any way. Another issue to mention is that the game is pretty short. I beat it in about two days. Replayability is also pretty bad, I imagine, since you'll already know how to solve all the puzzles. There is, however, two different endings, a good ending and a bad ending. Once you get both endings, though, there's no real reason to play through again other than to just re-experience the story.\n\nOverall (score 8/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score. I'd definitely have to recommend this game to fans of the point-and-click adventure genre. Trace Memory's excellent story-line and inventive puzzles are definitely worth experiencing at least once. So, rent it if you can; you could easily beat it in two days. Even if you can't find a place to rent it, just buy it. It's really cheap now, and is definitely worth your $10.", "summary": "Is Trace Memory Any Good?  You Bet It Is!", "unixReviewTime": 1241654400}

There is no career mode with tour buses and goals that typical games have. I think this is a good thing. The achievement that you earn is the ability to play guitar or bass. That's all I'm looking for. If you bought the first edition of Rocksmith and did not like it very much (I didn't like it), don't let that prevent you from getting this. This is like another planet.\n\nEveryone is talking about Session Mode and I'm sure that will be a big selling point for people that already know how to play. For me, a beginning bassist, it's nice to have the band backing, but randomly hitting notes when you have no real idea of what you are doing is cool but I'm sure once I get the hang of playing, this part of the game will be much more enjoyable.\n\nIf you want to learn to play, get this. I am doing bass only but I am sure the guitar play works the same way. I am using the Lessons and here is how they are laid out:\n\nYou first choose your instrument and click Lessons if you are a noob like me. The first couple show you how to hold the instrument and things like that. Then you start getting videos of different techniques and each of those lessons comes with a practice track. Here is where Rocksmith shines! Using the Riff Repeater feature, you can adjust the difficulty level from 0-100 using a slider: the lower the difficulty, the fewer notes that will scroll on by. If you start at say, 30, you can play that difficulty until you nail all of the notes and then move up to 40 and so on until you reach 100 which is all of the notes.\n\nBut that is not all. In addition to choosing the difficulty level, you can also use a slider to increase/decrease the speed. So if you want all notes but really slow, you can have that. If you want fast but fewer notes to play, then you can have that and everything in between. You can also loop the tracks so you play it a couple of times instead of just one, or you can have an infinite loop and the track will rewind and begin again until you stop it. You can pause and ramp up the difficulty and go right back into the track. If you overstep your ability, just pause, open Riff Repeater and readjust as you need to.\n\nThis is really an educational package for the Xbox rather than a game but it's amazing. I received it on launch day from Amazon and have been strictly using the Practice tracks in the Lessons and working on the Walking Bass lines in there at slow speed with fewer notes. I've inched up the meters a few times but need to master the level that I'm at now before moving on. Playing the track in an infinite loop has me playing it over and over and over and over again and I can feel my fingers beginning to stretch out and get more comfortable moving around the fingerboard.\n\nThe idea that you can plug in that guitar that's collecting dust rather than having to purchase special instruments to play with this game makes it such a worthwhile buy. It will be frustrating in the beginning if you've never played before (I know the feeling very well) but you really do find yourself saying \"I'll never get this\" and then all of a sudden you nail it and get such a rush. Then you add a few more notes, up the speed a little and get that too and you can't pull yourself away from playing because you realize that you can do it.\n\nI have had DVD tutorials for bass and while good, they don't provide the instant feedback that Rocksmith does. The presentation in this game is lightyears ahead of the original. Loading times are fast and the options were created to accommodate learners of all kinds and proficient players as well.\n\nI just can't say enough about this \"game.\" It's just amazing, fun, and really teaches you to play. While there is no substitute for a real teacher and learning theory and the like, if you are just a hobbyist looking to learn to play some songs and jam out on a real guitar, this is definitely for you.", "summary": "Don't be misled by the word \"game\"", "unixReviewTime": 1382572800}

With that said, the Super Mario Bros Wii U package is just simply the Wii U with the games Mario + Luigi Bros. So, it wasn't like it was a customized Wii U for Mario. That was a bit disappointing, but irrelevant to our game enjoyment. We've logged about 20 hours on the Mario Wii U game so far and it is quite fun! Still the challenge of jumping on each other and causing the other one to fall into the lava, water, etc. but that is part of the fun too. They managed to add some new stuff while maintaining all that made the prior versions great. I've heard very good things also about the Luigi version but have yet to play it.\nThere are a lot of bonus games (challenges like time and coin, etc.) that make it extremely challenging for bonus play. In addition to the 3 star coins per level, there are additional inventive and fun play opportunities using the Wii U Game Pad. I was pleasantly surprised that you have the unique ability when using the game pad (note: you can NOT controller a player in multi-player with the game pad) to create up to 4 blocks at any one time that can allow mario or other characters to jump on them. This provides a great \"life saving\" option if mario misses a jump and you can quickly give him a lava-saving step. This is done flawlessly and quickly in game while the action is occurring. Lastly, there are secret blocks and other items that appear only on the gamepad, and the game pad user must \"action\" them to allow mario to access them. These include 1ups and more.\n\nIn the end, we're extremely happy with this purchase and I already ordered Super Mario 3d World as I've heard it's simply a joy multiplayer and single. If you're on the fense as if you should purchase this new Wii U...especially if you already have an older Wii....ABSOLUTELY!

Stander", "reviewText": "I had a friend who recommended the RAT7 line of gaming mice. So I decided to replace my aging Logitech MX518 with one. After using it for about a week, I several huge problems with it that kept me from seeing it as a viable mouse at all, never mind a hardcore gaming mouse.\n\nFirstly, it's not ergonomic. I know what you're saying. \"But the whole thing is customizable! How is that possible?\" Honestly, the adjustments are mostly cosmetic and do not effect the mouse in any way that justifies them. One example is the adjustable palm rest. I have big hands, so I was exited to be able to adjust the length where it could sit more comfortably. The sliding palm rest really can't be adjusted to any position which is comfortable. If it's close up against the base of the mouse, it's not in your palm, it it's in the middle, it's too low to actually rest your palm on, and if it's at the end, it makes an uncomfortable gap you still can't rest your palm on. The left-side mouse buttons likewise are irrelevant. You can use the included tool to adjust the position of these three buttons, which I was anxious about because most mouse manufacturers are too stupid to put these side buttons far enough up the body for you to hit with your thumb without having to readjust your entire hand. But the adjustment was not significant enough to fix this problem. It's so minute, I wonder why they bothered including it at all.\n\nSecond, the laser is terrible. You may have done research online already and seen that RAT7s have an infamous laser problem. These people are not lying. It often loses the ability to track vertically, and as I write this review, it slowly crawls up the screen, despite my having both hands on the keyboard. No airliners or freight cars are passing by. The house is not shaking. The mouse is just terrible. The DPI is high, but again, this is another unnecessary feature someone decided to put into the mouse but that isn't useful. I've adjusted the DPI settings about ten times now and not a single one of them feels comfortable. It either flies around the screen too quickly to be precise, or doesn't feel responsive enough. The default settings are a joke, and changing them involves clicking and dragging a tiny slider around instead of letting you manually enter values, making it a tiresome chore you will hate.\n\nWhich is a good segue into the awful software. None of the custom commands works. I play League of Legends, so I tried both some simple commands (bind 'b' for back) and some complex ones (a macro to type out MIAs, including the enter keys to open the text chat and send the message). These worked with varying success, but without enough inconsistency to say without hesitation that the software is broken and does not work. I have the latest drivers and software installed, I'd like to point out, but sometimes one macro to type \"mid MIA\" would work, while another which is set up identically, but to say \"bot MIA\" would fail. There's just no explanation. Sometimes the message would come out garbled and with extra keys, sometimes it wouldn't work at all. The side-scrolling wheel not only had not macro settings built in to allow you to scroll left and right, which seems asinine not to have, but it's in a place so inconvenient, you'll never use it. When I tried using it in games, it did not work. The problem I mentioned earlier about the left-buttons being hard to hit on most mice? The scroll-wheel is this but a thousand times worse.\n\nAll those other problems aside, I discovered that the 'back' side mouse key is mechanically flawed and will intermittently continue to detect presses while held down instead of registering as one long key press. If you're gaming and you have any kind of skill attached to this which must be held, you're going to be upset if this is a common flaw.\n\nSo all in all, the Rat7 is kind of a piece of garbage. It looks nice and has the appearance of a solid build, but the few adjustments you can make don't change anything enough to matter, the laser is terrible and easily outperformed by my MX518 from years ago, and the software doesn't do what it says it will in games, which considering this is a gaming mouse, is about as inexcusable as you can get. And for people curious about whether I was using the wrong 'profile,' a key next to the left mouse button which cycles through three colours indicating three combinations of customs button maps and macros for each saved profile, no I ensured it was always on the correct profile for the game I was playing. (And sometimes just for fun programmed all three profiles to do the same things with equally dismal results.)\n\ntl;dr The Rat7 is not even close to worth the astronomical price they charge for it, buy something else that doesn't come broken.", "summary": "Not worth the money", "unixReviewTime": 1362355200}

Is it merely for being a launch title? Having the inFamous label? Its graphics? The previous inFamous games were superb and I think there was a good reason inFamouns is in tiny letters and Second Son overtakes the label. As though they felt bad even calling it inFamous. I think this was supposed to appeal to dudebros who just bought a PS4 and only play \"certain types\" of games. For the well rounded gamer, this is poison. I went in with high hopes and was constantly insulted... as a person. I don't like to be around characters like Delsin in real life, why would I want to play one in a game?\n\nIf you couldn't guess, my main complaint about this game would be the characters. They aren't likable at all, none of them. Your main character Delsin is kind of an angry arrogant teenager in a 25 year old's body who thinks he's Banksy and tries his hardest to be cool but he's just a douche. He's whiny, sad, lonely, abrasive, self absorbed, and incredibly sexist. The writing of his script shows they not only don't care about this character but whoever wrote him must think this giant sack of dung is the coolest person in the world. He forces his brother to constantly go against his own principles and do wrong by questioning his manliness and his devotion to family.\n\nThe female protagonist is super cliche and basically her only focus is blaming her drug problems on pushers and killing them off. She's petty, small minded, easy, and I guess embodies a drug addict but still not a character I want in this game. I kept playing, even with how much I hated all the characters. The worst part is everyone is calling you on your phone all the time to complain at you and you just get whiny at them and the ringtone is just horribly annoying.\n\nThe city design is terrible. Everything looks the same, there's no compass direction on the map indicator, the layout making getting around over complicated, the \"fast travel\" stations only work when you go to one so they're halfway useless, and the change of day doesn't change the city. I kept playing even though the game was clunky. The city was just a low point and it made me miss the amazing open world designs in pretty much every other game like this.\n\nThere are still bugs after patching. Some of the missions don't trigger so you have to restart them several times. Sometimes double the enemies spawn. Randomly guys will be much more active about shooting you so sometimes it's super easy and other times you get shot to death in a couple seconds. There is a glitch where spray painting makes people stop shooting you as well.\n\nSo when did I stop playing? How about the tedious and terribly designed boss battles and fighting system. How about the niche overuse of new PS4 control methods? That's what usually hurts a game. When you just can't enjoy playing it after you remove everything else. The melee is basic and the most powerful but it's so badly done. Shooting powers give almost no damage and headshots take ridiculous accuracy, which your character doesn't have. You can take 20 shots and easily miss a guy you have your reticle right on. Your character goes down fast so you have to hit, shoot, hide, wait, hit, hide, shoot, hide, and repeat that for the entire game. You don't ever feel powerful. Worst of all your super ability takes about 15 seconds to watch and isn't skipable. It keeps me from even wanting to use it.\n\nThere's also the quirky things they tried to do but just became obnoxious. The touchpad is used for several things and it just seems stupid like Sony demanded they use it. The spray painting is just pathetic and the mechanics for that are clunky as well. The sound coming out of the controller becomes annoying. The phone ringing, absorbing things, just any loud high pitched annoying sound they could throw through that thing at way too high of a volume, they did.\n\nSo why would you like or play this game? I don't know, maybe you're capable of overlooking all of the terrible qualities on your wasted money. The story is not even redeemable, it's a rip-off of X-Men. If you look at the competent well done reviews by the more reputable people around gaming, you find mixed or negative feelings toward this game. It's just bad and I only enjoyed the first 20 minutes, until you start getting powers and become a needy child wanting more and more. Because all you care about is more powers so you can be cool and tough.\n\nThis is a launch title, nothing more. It was an attempt to go \"look what I can do\" and then be flashy. Nothing real is gained by going good or bad or replaying it either way. The game is basically the same. It looks great, plays awful, had no individual thought. It's the worst game I've played in 2014. It's an attempt to be X-Men, not inFamous. Bad story, gameplay, mechanics, design, and characters make it one of the all time worst games I've played. I just hope they remaster the first two inFamous games for PS4 so I can forget this one ever happened.", "summary": "Worst protagonist ever, plus bad story, bad mechanics, poor design, and more", "unixReviewTime": 1420156800}

I haven't really played a fighter in years and I only got the HD Remix version of II just to psych myself up for this release and yet this game was on my list to buy for games in February. Maybe it's the name, the calibre and quality Capcom is known for but maybe I want to go back to 1992 and 1993 when it was fun just to fight people and friends. There's a couple of balance issues here and there and the new fighters aren't as memorable as previous new ones like Cammy or Fei Long but it's still a fun fighter with enough accessibility for new players and yet room for the hardcore.\n\nStory: Not really much of a story here but basically after II, the supposed fall of M. Bison and Shadaloo has actually brought about a new threat, that of S.I.N, the weapons section of Shadaloo. Each character will have an anime video at the beginning and end of their arcade playthrough but they're a little brief, not really substantial but they're at least cooler than text ones or bizarre ones (Dead or Alive 4 anyone?)\n\nGraphics: When HD Remix was released, character models got an upgrade that looked more anime-influenced than anything but IV takes it in a different direction with a more striking and colorful art style and frankly it's gorgeous. Even the background levels look stunning such as being on a boat in front of a sun setting by the bay to a tranquil-looking jungle and a busy marketplace. Character models and animations are also quite well done with small details like Blanka's eyes popping out when you nail the final blow or the second try Dan has to do before he finally throws someone. Installing to hard drive is a must since load times are barely found and replicates an arcade experience even more.\n\nSound/Music: Included with the collector's edition of the game is the soundtrack and it's actually really awesome. From techno to big epicness, the music in the game is really great. While others praise 3rd Strike's soundtrack more (which I haven't heard), the tunes in this one is cool...except Fei Long whose theme literally has his yell voice clips mixed in. As for voice acting I always kept it at Japanese and I prefer it that way and of course nobody can complain about Japanese voice acting. Even cute little catgirls with high voices are better in Japanese so there's no complaints here.\n\nGameplay: Anyone who knows how to hadouken and lightning kick will easily get the hang of it but there's some other gameplay elements to give it a bit more kick. EX moves where you perform a bit more damaging version of a move is here and if you get hit enough, your revenge meter will fill which'll let you unleash a powerful Ultra combo complete with more cinematic camera angles rather than just 2D. They're slightly difficult to pull off and some characters like Guile or Vega have ultras that I still haven't been able to say even in practice mode with the meters at infinite. Going through the training and challenges will let you become more capable over time but be warned: some of the people online are either cheap move fighters or really good so I'd either fight computer for a good while or at least train in player matches.\n\nThe character roster is quite good though there's some inclusions and some absent. Added are Abel, Crimson Viper, Rufus and El Fuerte. Abel's probably the easiest to get into while the rest are a little practice-makes-perfect kinds where you really got to know the ins and outs of the character to use them effectively and not spam fireballs or just turtle and flash kick everyone. Included in the roster are Sakura, Dan, Cammy, Akuma, Gouken and Fei Long as well as favorites such as Ryu, Chun Li, Vega and Guile. Each character has their own strengths and weaknesses and you'll probably use some more than others unless you really know how to fully use one character.\n\nOne thing that is always found in fighters are exploits or cheap moves. For example, a move that knocks you off your feet the minute you get up or people who jump in and sweep, back away, jump and sweep but most AI characters aren't like this, that is until you get to Seth. Keep in mind I don't play most fighters so I can't say if there's anyone worse but this guy is probably one of the most infuriating characters not because he's fast, better and more agile but because he spams, cancels out moves and seems to almost know instinctively what you want to do. Charge moves can be done 3 times in a row, throws can find you anywhere and he'll even teleport into a throw and well, let's just say he's a pain. Some characters will also do that as well and never seem to let you have a chance or keep you in the corner until you're dead so be warned that some fights will make the veins in your forehead pop up...just like a fighter would do.\n\nAs for the collector's edition, it comes with the free Brawler pack DLC which is alternate costumes for certain characters, the aforementioned awesome soundtrack, a comic detailing the new characters moves and combos and the anime film \"The Ties That Bind\" which is roughly an hour. I haven't watched it yet though I get the feeling it'll be either really cool but cheesy or cheesy and unintentionally hilarious. Or maybe all of it. Oh and there's a Crimson Viper figurine (rather tiny actually, there's more plastic case than the damn figurine) for the Xbox 360 version while the lucky PS3 buyers get Ryu. I don't see why 360 doesn't get Ken just for compliment's sake or even Chun Li and Crimson Viper is one of the more \"meh\" characters so I don't get why they picked that one.\n\nAs for the game itself, it's awesome, I haven't experienced a lot of hiccups online and despite some of the dubious requirements for unlocking Akuma and Gouken, the roster and moves make this a must buy for fighter fans.", "summary": "An exceptional fighting game", "unixReviewTime": 1235260800}

The special attacks are relatively simple to pull off, and the characters are all extremely well balanced, so no fighter has any innate advantages over the others. Winning is based purely on the skill of the player rather than the character they chose. There's an nice roster of characters to choose from, so it's fairly easy to pick your poison and get down to playing, especially since most characters have more or less the same moves they always did.\n\nGraphically, the game is a wonder to behold. Capcom did an amazing job bringing the animated characters into 3D. Everyone looks just how you imagined they would, and the detail involved is great. Even the backgrouds are filled with motion. Likewise, the soundtrack is also good, updating some old favorites and throwing in some new songs to boot.\n\nThe new characters add some flair to the game, and the animated opening and ending cinemas for each character, while not very long or detailed, give a little more insight into the storyline than usual. If you pay attention, the stories coincide, giving the game a united storyline. In all, Street Fighter IV is simply an incredible game.\n\nHowever, the game does have it's flaws.\n\nStreet Fighter IV is not kind to the casual gamer. I've played every Street Fighter since Street Fighter 2 on Super Nintendo, so I'd like to think I'm a decent player. I popped in the game, picked Ken, and played the game on Medium difficulty. And the computer won. Over and over again. Even on the easiest difficulty setting available, the computer can be merciless. You'll be winning sometimes and other times you'll hit a stage and the difficulty will spike. Suddenly you can't beat this one opponent no matter how hard you try. After about dozen losses, you finally get lucky and win. Then you reach the final boss, and you probably know already that true to form, he's a cheap little sucker.\n\nThe focus of the game has also changed from easy-to-create combos to the new focus attack system. Theoretically, one can string together long combos by cancelling moves with focus attacks and then dashing to do another move. Challenge mode offers Trials meant to teach the player to use this system, but the combos it calls for can be all but impossible to do for those of us who aren't pros. Be prepared to spend a very, very long time practicing. That means sore thumbs and cramped hands for the casual gamer.\n\nIn all this is an excellent game, one any Street Fighter fan should own. The difficulty of the computer and the complexity of the combos are a bit tedious, but with a lot of practice you should be fine. Besides, I always had the most fun playing Street Fighter with my friends, and I'm sure this game will be no different.

It does that one specific function quite well and also looks very clean and nice. It also has additional usb ports which are very handy and can be used to charge a variety of other things as well. The only thing that is slightly disappointing is the controller charging stations. They do work but you must make certain that the controllers click in just right which should be an easier task than it is. It would help if they had put lights in to show that the chargers have been placed just right in their bays for the charging to actually be taking place. You can hear a click and think you got it right only to find out your controller hasn't been charging at all.

This product is as basic as they come, while providing critical functionality with the Xbox One. They are good, but not necessarily great.\n\nSince these are wired, there's nothing to charge. There are no buttons or switches on the headset. There's a permanently wired cable that comes from the bottom of the left ear-cup. The boom-mic plugs into a jack on the bottom of the left ear-cup. Ideally, I wish it were made so you could plug the boom-mic into either ear-cup, in case you have a preference. I find the cable a bit short. While it works great from controller-to-headset, it's a bit short for other applications -- such as using it for listening to music on a PC or phone, for example.\n\nThe headset has a good construction, very unique as compared to other Turtle Beach headsets I've used. The head band flexes firmly as you pull apart the ear-cups to place the headset on your head, but doesn't close too tightly. Disclosure: I have a small head. There's a strip of leather-like padding that sits on top of your head. I keep a permanent buzzcut, and this padding feels great for long periods of time. The ear-cups are padded with a simple foam and cloth material instead of leather, which in my opinion keeps them cooler -- and you feeling cooler -- while using them. The ear-cups extend lower so they can be sized to your head, and they swivel to provide a decent fit.\n\nI've used these for hours at a time with no discomfort.\n\nThese sound good, with decent overall sound in terms of bass and treble, but I find that the midrange -- especially voices -- seem to be a bit weak. This is surprising considering these are a complete solution, with voice chat being a major feature. Since there's nothing electronic about this headset, there's no way to compensate for this. Additionally, when listening to music or podcasts from another device, your control of the sound is limited to the controls available on that device. Additionally, the volume output is limited to the power that can be provided by your device. Phones are less likely capable of driving these at higher volumes.\n\nThese are specifically marketed for use with Xbox One, because it includes the headset adaptor which snaps onto the bottom of the Xbox One controller. I ran into trouble performing the update. While my first attempt to update the controller (more of an Xbox One issue than the headset's) failed, a second attempt was successful and provided full functionality. The headset adaptor allows the Xbox One console to send chat AND full game audio to the controller, which is then passed to this headset (or any headset) plugged into it.\n\nUnfortunately, it's not a completely wireless solution because you'll always have a wire going from the controller to the headset. If you need to get up temporarily, you either need to take the controller with you (say, to the kitchen) or take the headset off. This is why I wish the cable was longer, because it would allow you to move around your immediate area if you need to put the controller down temporarily.\n\nSound quality wirelessly through the controller is actually quite good. Full game audio is clean and crisp and sound full-spectrum from my perspective. The adaptor on the controller offers the ability to mute chat, change the volume between chat and game audio, and control overall volume. There's no mute, though, for game audio -- which is a bit annoying if somebody walks into the room and needs to ask you a question.\n\nThe product also includes the necessary in-line amp and cable solutions that can be used with your Xbox 360 and PC.\n\nIf you are looking for a complete chat and game audio solution for your Xbox One, and don't desire any bells-and-whistles, then you should give these a try. They are pretty much plug-and-play, then forget it. They sound good, fit good, and work well with the Xbox One.", "summary": "Completely wired, no bells and whistles", "unixReviewTime": 1399593600}

The gameplay is straightforward and logical; you won't be asking yourself \"what do I do next?\" very often. The hidden object scenes are clear and the objects big enough that you won't need a magnifying glass to find them. The mini games are mostly easy, some ridiculously so.\n\nBut to me, it appeared as if this game was cobbled together from discarded concept scenes from other games. This seems to be borne out by the fact that the first half takes place in the amusement park and then you suddenly jump through a portal into a surreal world that's dominated for some reason by a windmill motif. You can't even credit the game developers with a strange form of originality for this turn of events as the alternate world is jam packed with tasks and locations that you've seen in every other game. In fact, I would almost swear that parts of some of the scenes I have actually seen in other games.\n\nNow anyone who has played a certain number of HOGs would argue that there is a lot of repetition in concept and tasks when it comes to these games. But the better games can twist even the most familiar narrative and add something interesting to the mix, whether a unique variation to some of the mini games or even just employing a striking drawing style. This game is just sort of lifeless. I also think that the abandoned amusement park theme hasn't been visited THAT many times, as in contrast to the mental asylum or haunted house themes, so there is plenty of opportunity for original material here, which unfortunately was wasted.\n\nFurther evidence that Weird Park: Broken Tune was a bit of an afterthought is that you are provided a journal, but it is barely updated. Towards the end of the game it is all but discarded. The locations are limited, and I would guess that is why you have to play some of the HOG scenes not twice, but three times.\n\nThere is a plot involving playing a detective who must search the abandoned park looking for a journalist; the conclusion kind of makes sense. A demon sprite and an evil clown are the main characters. I did get a laugh when one of the characters turns out to be a total coward and literally runs out of the game.\n\nLastly, there is a problem with the hint button that is represented in the game by a forlorn organ grinding monkey with a thousand yard stare. The problem is that it doesn't seem to work very well. The button responded when I pressed it, but did not actually show where the hidden object was, it just reset itself. I tried it a couple of more times in different scenes just to confirm there was a problem, and only once did a circle appear around the object. I checked around the gaming sites to see if I was the only one with this issue, and I wasn't. This may have been corrected since the game first came out, but is something to bear in mind, though there are at least two walkthroughs of the game out there to consult if need be. IMO, you will not have to resort to using the hint button very much any way.\n\nTo end on a positive note, I would say that this game is good for HOG beginners. Frequent players won't hate it, but might be disappointed. My alternative pick for a satisfying amusement park themed game would be Dreamland, also available on Amazon.", "summary": "O.K., but......", "unixReviewTime": 1326412800}

A great headset enhances the experience and makes the game itself more enjoyable as a result. Turtle Beach has been in this particular hardware game for quite some time now, but the Ear Force Stealth 420X Headset for the Xbox One shows that they are still among the best in the business.\nTo start with, you have a fully wireless headset. You use a dongle to connect the headset to the console, but the Stealth 420X cuts the middle man (in this case, the controller) out of the equation. Personally, I am a huge fan of that, because I am a gamer who has arms that tend to... well, for lack of a better word, flail. I am pretty animated, and there have been countless times that wired headsets got in my way, sometimes jerking the set down on my head oddly or accidentally getting disconnected. None of that to contend with here.\n\nThe actual setup is quite easy. This thing is basically plug and play. There is an included USB cable that you can use for charging. Charge times sure seemed pretty snappy. I completely played the headset out until the battery was dead and put it on the cable to charge. I gave it about fifteen minutes to see if the headset was usable. I am not sure how long it would take for a 'full charge', but in that fifteen minutes I was able to get another couple of hours out of the set.\n\nThe typical dials and features you would expect are here, including game and chat volume controls to blend the audio to your personal preference. The mic monitoring feature might be my favorite addition, however. Not for me. Despite my various arm gesticulations, I am fairly quiet when I use a headset. I listen more than I speak - that is just my personality when playing a game online.\n\nThen there is my son.\n\nMy sixteen year old son during more intense games has a tendency to get caught up in things. The headsets tend to seal out sound, he has them cranked up, he is into the moment, and he is so bloody loud that I pretty much have to compare him to someone trying to yell over the jackhammer of a construction worker. I made him use this particular feature, and certainly he had his moments where he would get loud - but almost immediately realized it and piped down. I do believe that if nothing else, this makes the Ear Force Stealth 420X Headset my wife's new best friend.\n\nNext up, I wanted to discuss the construction of the headset. To start, it has the typical Turtle Beach black and green aesthetics - my son's favorite color combination. I get the feeling he is going to be using these a lot. With a full charge, the headset lasts well over a dozen hours and despite the sturdy design, the headset itself never felt overly heavy. The ear pad foam is soft, comfortable and while not completely noise cancelling, does a very solid job of helping to seal out exterior sounds. There is a nice pad on the underside of the band as well, so the headset never got uncomfortable with settling the bulk of its weight across the top of my head.\n\nThe band itself expands down near where the cups are at, and the ear cups themselves have some nice swivel to them. This makes the Stealth 420X easy to adjust and comfortable for a variety of different heads. My soon made note of the fact that the cups actually did not press in on the arms of his glasses, which he was quite happy about. One other nice big of construction design is that the boom microphone can be attached and detached at will. If you simply want to listen to music or a television show (and there is an additional 3.5mm auxiliary port on the headset for those who want to use these to listen to an iPhone, MP3 player or your PC/Laptop/Tablet).\n\nThe one drawback to using the headset in this fashion is that there is no passive listening - you need to have the headset turned on. Otherwise it will not carry audio. That means you have to keep them charged, and that the blinking/glowing nature of the headset makes them slightly distracting to simply walk out and about with. The headset has a handy power saving mode when it is not getting a feed through the dongle connected to the Xbox One, which is a great feature when you have it in the living room and may have accidentally left the headset on. It is less awesome when you are trying to use it with your cell phone while out and about. There is a tone that indicates that the headset might go into this power saving mode, and you can press a button to keep it going, but it is an inconvenience that could have been skipped by allowing for passive listening. I could not find any way of turning this power saving feature off.\n\nThe construction of the headset itself is of a more medium weight. The headset is mostly plastic, which keeps it light. This is great for long hours of gaming as many gamers feel fatigue when the headset is worn for too long. However, it does give a slightly cheaper impression and while I have had no problems with this set as of yet, time is usually kinder to headsets of bulkier construction. I suspect that the lighter design is in part due to the idea that these can be used with mobile devices, but that loops me back to the inability of this particular headset to passively listen.\n\nThe sound quality of said microphone is also very good. The microphone gets nods from my friends who say the sound quality is excellent. It does a very nice job of picking up my voice, but is not so incredibly sensitive that background noises like fans are a distraction. This time of the year it is pretty hot, so I have a handful of fans going around me at any time. I was a bit worried that they might pick up as annoying white noise, and a couple of my friends said that they could hear the fans, but that they were by no means distracting. That is some nice balance between picking up my nearby voice clearly while not being so sensitive as to pick up those external distractions.\n\nThe speaker audio is quite good. It handles the low rumble of bass well, and does not get distorted with more treble heavy fair. This is not the richest, fullest sound experience I have ever heard, but there were no glaring issues that came out of the headset either. The drivers can pack a pretty nice level of audio without crackling and distorting, even when you choose to boost the bass. It did feel as though this headset was tuned more for gaming - music and movies worked well, but the audio relays gunfire better than subtle musical notes. As mentioned earlier, the foam is comfortable but the headset is not noise cancelling, so some ambient noise can certainly leak in.\n\nThe Ear Force Stealth 420X Headset by Turtle Beach is one of the best Xbox One headsets I have had the pleasure of using. The voice monitoring is an outstanding feature that I would like to see show up in other headsets down the road. It is easy to hook up and it looks sharp while wearing comfortably. It is better suited as a gaming headset, despite an effort to make it versatile for those looking for headphones on the go as well. Still, the extra functionality is appreciated and helps to round out a nice overall package.", "summary": "One of the best headsets you can find for the Xbox One", "unixReviewTime": 1443052800}

You shouldn't be disappointed though.\n\nThe sounds for the most part are awesoem too, though they could have used a bit more work in places.

Basically its like riding a roller coaster and you point your gun at things you want to die. Which is more fun then it sound.\n\nStory\nThe story line is VERY captivating (I actually purchased dead space after playing this game), and this game is a prequel to Dead space. The very beginning really grabs your attention because you literally thrown into insanity. Then the game basically turns into an alien horror film, and your objective is NOT to die.\n\nControls\nThe controls on this game are fairly simple. You see thing you want, point on them....\n\nYou see you don't like, point at them.\n\nThen you basically have other lil quirks that you forget you have, and are told to use. One thing is the secondary function which requires you to twist your wrist... seems like a button would of did better.\n\nAnother lil thing that annoys me is, to pick up things, you toss this glowing white ball which is awfully annoying to look at and sometimes takes up a huge part of the screen.\n\nGameplay\nThe game is awesome, although its a rail shooter, you often times have options/choices to pick from. When you're at a cross-road you can pick left or right, when you find a gun you determine which one you want. There are often points in the game where you decide the direction of gameplay (not sure how that affects story yet, makes for another play thru)\nDid I mention they curse in this game? That is mainly a side note, but this game is packed with extra features. The comic is probably my favorite part and they do a LOT of cursing in that.\n\nConclusion\nIf you were to buy any Wii Game, there are few justifiable buys.\nMario Kart, Smash bros, Twilight Princess (for multiple reasons), Metroid, Mario Galaxy... (the list goes on, but it is a short list).\nI would argue this game is a justifiable buy", "summary": "A game that MIGHT be worth it", "unixReviewTime": 1256169600}

The Trilogy comes with 3 GW games Prophecies,Factions, and Nightfalls. I can honestly see the variating differences in all the games. I'll start by saying what most people already know. Guild Wars is a very pretty game. The game has great detail in terrain, and character design. For the most part I believe that is one of the main reasons that it remains somewhat popular to this day. However, the game play is not as beautiful as the graphics. Guild Wars Factions of the 3 games o nthe Trilogy I have is the ugliest game of them all.\n\n  Aside from the starter mission the main missions take place in a Chinese ghetto mostly. You will be in this ghetto about 80% of the game. Unlike the previous game, trying to navigate around in Factions is a punishing task. Many times you will find yourself running into dead ends, or comming across mobs of goons that drop from seemingly out of no where. I really did not find this game satisfying at all. Every corner you turned waited mobs of 15-20 goons waiting to attack you(no that's not a rough estimate either). Exploring is almost out the question even if you have a 5 star team.\n\n The reward for fighting mob after mob just is not worth it. There were almost 15 quest that I had completed in the game, that I did not even bother to go and collect the reward on, because it was too difficult to return to the areas to collect them. I love games and I've played many in my lifetime, but this was the first game where I completed portions of it, and simply did not care to even pickup my reward. The design of Factions makes playing it a chore. Aren't games supposed to be enjoyable? What is this?\n\n I also want to add that that Factions does include a better story than the randomly confusing story of Prohpecies that did not connect well, nor have a true point in the end. This time the plot is pretty cut and dry. Although the story doesn't compell you to beat the game, it is better than the previous attempt at a solid story.\n\n Along side the story you have some new classes. You have Assasin, and ritualist. I play mainly an Assassin, and I've never been so furiated at gameplay controls and design. The Assassin skills are chain skills meaning you need to use skills A,B,&C to unlock skill D the one that you only wanted to use in the first place. When you add this skill setting style to a limit of 8 skills at a time it gets old. What you will find are few basic skill sets that will work. Eventually you will get tired of doing the same sequences over and over again. I played PVP on my assassin and every fight was the same. I have little chose in what moves I chose because the game limited what I could do. It's like it was telling me how to play. It just made a class that could have been a lot of fun a chore to play. The designers could have done a better job with the assassin skill set, as most skills are very similar just listed in different catagories. Which makes chaining them even more of am annoyance.\n\nAnother drawback to the game is the community of Guild Wars. Factions has harder missions where henchman and Hero's will just not be enough. You have to use live players, and in an online RPG game like Guild Wars most of the players are children that don't understand the concepts of teamwork. You'll again be stuck looking for people to help you finish a mission you need to beat the game. It really wouldn't be so bad since Guild Wars is a highly sociable online RPG game, there is always someone around. However, the people that are around are not always the ideal people to mingle with. The community of Guild Wars is on a pre-teen level. There are many immature players that waist no opportunity to vent hateful, and mindless message to any and every player they can find. You'll be quickly tired of reading internet lingo spewed in the chat box every other second. You'll also get tired watching every miserable teen vent their meaningless adolesent fury on any player who says something they don't like. Saying \"hello\" might trigger an argument in this game.\n\n All things aside I did not find Factions very enjoyable. The only reason I took the time out to beat it was due t o the fact I paid $50.00 for the game and get something out of it. Factions was the 2nd Guild Wars game I played and beat, and I'm not interested in continuing. Playing redundant missions, fighting mindless mobs over and over and over again, being given missions with more text to read than the bible, and  having to put up with a community that would best be suited for a middleschool, does not interest me at all. The game is very limited and walks on rails as far as what you can do, and what you can experiene in this game. Some people may love this game, and some like me may see it otherwise.\nI did not bother to compare guild wars to games like Warcraft because Warcraft is an MMO. Guild wars is basicly an Online RPG that allows you to have the option of interacting with other players IF you wish to do so.\n\nThe bottom line is that if you love Guild Wars, and enjoy the gameplay and community, than Factions should be just fine for you, but if your looking for a game that has more depth to it, and community that has at the very least passed puberty, than Guild Wars really is not for you.", "summary": "Guild Wars is a Pretty Awful!

Dalman", "reviewText": "When so many games these days focus on death and destruction, it's nice to have a constructive alternative that is still truly addictive. Filling that niche, as ever, is the prominent Maxis series SimCity.\n\nThe latest offering, SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition, contains all the robust play offered by a completely new version of the city-building legend as well as a plethora of additional content, tools, and mini-games previously sold separately in the Rush Hour add-on pack.\n\nLike it's predecessors, SimCity 4 is a deep and visually rich simulation. As Mayor the player gets to turn blank plots of land into complex thriving communities with the added challenge of linking them together to form a productive inter-dependent region. With that much realestate to manage, it should hold the interest of creative problem-solvers.\n\nIt's a complicated game, but not overly so, and the hierarchic interface is intuitive, which helps a lot since it takes a few hours to get a good grip on the basics of making a successful city (I highly recommend completing all the tutorials before striking out on your own). Once you can figure out how to grow while keeping a positive cash flow, the game becomes immensely rewarding.\n\nAside from obviously improved graphics resolution and building variety, the biggest change is that every change in the city is calculated around individual sim-citizens rather than grand formulas. Your job, more than anything else, is to keep your sims happy. If you can do that - provide them with jobs, shorten their commutes, educate them, care for their health, and keep them safe - you have what it takes to be a Mayoral Mogul!\n\nThat new perspective also means you can get much more involved with the denizens of your metropolis. You can get down to the street-level and ask them what's on their mind or even give them a hand through mini-games.\n\nDriving many vehicles (fire trucks, speed boats, and crop-dusters to name a few) you can navigate the city you've made. While the simplistic pilotage can be clunky, change of perspective is both fun and helpful. It also splashes a little variety on a game that can get slow once in a while. Besides, what soldier can resist taking a joy ride in a tank or skimming the rooftops in an attack helicopter?\n\nWhat really keeps you playing this game though is layer upon layer of replay possibilities. Since there are no criteria for winning you can set your own goals and measures of success and you can use any number of approaches pursue your ambitions.\n\nYou can play one city aiming for a large population and another for the greatest income possible. You can play the good guy or the ruthless dictator and create everything from slum-ridden industrial towns to tiny farming communities to towering pinnacles of civilization!\n\nAnd of course you can blow it all up and start over...\n\nThere's no multiplayer in SimCity, but an active online user-base provides both a community aspect to the game and a wealth of new land marks, buildings, and utilities you can download to keep your virtual communities fresh.\n\nIf you own The Sims the people you've created can even interact with your SimCities. What's more, there's a little Mac-only integration in the game. Unlike Windows, you can override the default soundtrack with any playlist in your iTunes library.\n\nWhile that's a nice touch, the manual refers to Windows keyboards and there are known graphical problems (especially when \"drawing\" roads or zones) that are unlikely to be addressed (turning on the Z buffer in the options helps). They aren't fatal, but I found my building techniques developed around minimizing the effects those glitches rather than productive gameplay.\n\nEven with drawbacks like performance and price (when compared to the Windows version), it's a quality title and a handy long-term time-waster for creative, micro-managing, or ambitious future base commanders!\n\nSimCity 4 Deluxe Edition is a great gift and worth owning if you remember SimCity 2000 on the Mac or are looking for a constructive game that exercises your creativity. Of course the inclusion of military facilities like Army and Air Force bases and ICBM silos earns it some kudos too!", "summary": "Review for the Military Members Apple User Group", "unixReviewTime": 1151193600}

This game IS hard. All of the Souls games are hard. They are suppose to be challenging. I said the same thing 5 years ago when Demon Souls came out. But I gave it a chance, and since has become my most favorite game franchise EVER.\n\nIf you played the other Dark Souls games, you will pick this one up quickly. The game play is virtually identical, with addition of a special move set attached to each weapon. There have been a few changes since Dark Souls 2. The Estus system now includes FP (skill points, Mana or Magicka - whatever you choose to call it) You allot your Estus Flasks between your HP and FP. This is annoying for lower level caster builds, because you must choose between your Health, and your Magic. Also there are a few new weapons, armor sets, spells, miracles, and pyromancies. There aren't as many new items as you would hope however. MOST of the weapons, spells, etc have been carried over from the other Souls games. This is good for familiarity, but for the first playthrough, you will be surprised at how long it takes you to find a weapon you haven't seen before. This game combines aspects from ALL of the Souls games, including Demons Souls and Bloodborne. The overly large, very fast moving enemies from Bloodborne make an appearance in this game. Not the same enemies of course, just similar in combat style. The slower dumb enemies are here too, as well as many humanoid enemies that fight like a real human player would. This adds to the challenge, and ultimately the frustration, as you will die a lot more. That's good though. The challenge adds to the replayabilty of this game.\n\nThe online aspects of this game are also what add to the replayabilty, and have created such a loyal fan base. The problem though is that the COOP and PVP elements are still broken after the game has been out a month. I did not subtract a star for this, because they will fix it, as they always do. I am surpised of the problems, this far after the release. There have been days at a time, that there is virtually NO ONLINE PLAY. That totally sucks, but don't let that prevent you from buying it. THEY WILL FIX IT.\n\nSo when it works, PVP and COOP is pretty amazing. You can summon up to 3 people to help you, usind a dried finger (2 people without the finger). You can also be invaded by a plethora of human players itching to kill you. Up to 6 players in the game, including the host (YOU) can exist at any one time. You can choose to manually summon phantoms to help you, or wear a special item that will automatically bring phantoms to your aid when you get invaded. The online play of this game is unlike any other game, and it has in turn created a HUGE LOYAL fan following.\n\nSo I will wrap it up. You can see videos on youtube all day that will give you more info than any written review. I will say this though: If you have played all the Souls games including Bloodborne, this game will seem very famliar to you. So many aspects have been carried over including weapons, spells, bosses, areas, NPCs, items, move sets, armor, etc. If you are not familiar with other souls games, this game will give you a run for your money. It is challenging, and not straight forward at all. There is nothing linear about this game. There is a lot left to figure out even after you think you've completed an area. If you can get past the initial learning curve of the game, you will end up loving it just like all the other loyal fans.", "summary": "Easily the most challenging, and REWARDING game ever", "unixReviewTime": 1463270400}

Well, what can i say, the game is just PERFECT, as the score of so many magazines 10 of 10, the graphics shine and are state of the art, the music is perfect, the play control is awesome and the best of all THERE WAS NO BUGS!!, at least not during my watch, i can say that i don't know what is happening with the pc versions, but sometimes it has to do with the video card, other times with the sound cards, other times with some hardware i don't know.

If you are a fan of the original Sims, you know what I mean.  Here are some pros and cons that I think are important:\n\nPROS\n\n*  The sim designer is extremely well done, especially the facial expressions and the amount of variety you can add to the facial types is very good.  Just using the tools you can create almost any kind of face including mimicking the appearance of any racial type.  In the original, black and asian characters looked like appropriately skinned white people, a little weird.\n\nI also like being able to choose formal, causal, swimsuit, etc..  Although there are only 4 sets of workout clothes (even with expansion.)\n\n*  The lifecycle is excellent, sims go through all stages of life, (and one additional stage in the expansion pack).  They have babies, get married die, and all that.  It's awesome!\n\n*  Adult sims can enter into any type of relationship they want including serial dating, and same-sex relationships.\n\n*  The houses are really fun to design and the 3d view really lets you get inside.  I can usually mimic any of my real life friends houses, or workplaces.  They instantly recognize their house.\n\n*  Looks AWESOME on flat-panel display.  Very impressive.\n\n*  The \"Townies\" that came with the hot date expansion pack are back, so you can have a fun game even if there is only one house in your town.  You can even date the mailwoman!\n\nCONS\n\n*  My best and fastsest computer will not run the game.  I am a computer engineer and have tried everything.  I have over 150 computer games and they all work except for this one.  Be careful if you have an Nvidia Ge force 4 with an AMD chipset.  Others have complained also and the patch doesnt fix the problem.\n\n*  Free will can be frustrating.  If you assign a task to a sim while he is engaged in \"free will\" actions, he will drop whatever he is doing and perform the new task.  I have no complaints with the free will except for this, and in big families it is good to leave it on.  There should be an option to queue new commands until hte current free-will action is done.  It gets quite annoying with multiple sims.  For example you have to sit and wait for your sim to get out of the tub before you can tell him to pick clothes to wear or he will suddenly rise up out of the bath half-dirty.  Nobody wants to see that.\n\n*  The items seemed to be intentionally scaled down to make room for expansion packs.  That's just cheap.  Same is true with hairstyles.  Shockingly the expansion pack does not add many more hairstyles, clothing options, or furniture.  Also lame.\n\n*  You are limited to the angles of your walls and furniture, which limits creativity.\n\n*  The aspiration system is good but the rewards are to easy to get, and too weird.  It's hard to roleplay a realistic family when you have 37 money trees, 2 Magic love inducing hot tubs, a mood elevator, 5 sunglass stands and a 4 magic baby bottle makers.  The good news is you can ignore aspiration entirely without too much consequence.\n\n*  It takes too long to move betewen lots.  You have to have lots of patience to enjoy the common lots.\n\nThis game is excellent.  It is a great game for dads to play with their 4-10 year old girls especially (a doll house that daddy won't mind playing with.)

If there was any question that Nintendo was at the top of their game then it has completely disappeared with Super Mario Galaxy 2. This game controls flawlessly.\n\nGraphics 10/10: While Capcom held the graphic standard with Monster Hunter Tri. Nintendo decides to come in and reclaim the standard with SMG2. This game is absolutely gorgeous! The original's game engine was stellar, but Nintendo has somehow made the second that much better. You won't want to look away. Even if you're an HD console fan you won't be able to deny how fantastic SMG2 looks.\n\nStory N/A: Look, if you havn't figured out that Mario games aren't about story yet then it's time to open your eyes. I've seen this particular category being placed in the negative in a lot of reviews. Come on now. Mario is about challenge, gameplay, and sheer fun. We all know that. However, Nintendo has done an outstanding job finding new ways of saving Peach in order to keep it fresh.\n\nSound 10/10: The orchestrated music in SMG2 is a pleasure to listen to, and you will find yourself getting caught in stages listening to the soundtrack. With new and old music there is something for everyone to love.\n\nOverall 10/10: SMG2 is an achievement that could have only been accomplished by Nintendo. Analysts wonder why third parties have such issues with selling games on Nintendo platforms, and this is the reason.

When Midnight Club 1 was around im pretty sure thats when Burnout came on the scene, and Burnout looked spectacularly better. However this game is extremely fun, and yet frustrating.\nYou street race. There is an incredible likeness to \"The Fast and the Furious\". You can do nitro, which basically looks like fast and furious, and feels pretty cool too as you watch the scenery speed by you. You street race by picking cars to race with. I do not know the difficulty of any of the cars, so when you start up a series of races(with saves in between) you honestly don't know what your getting into. I did this race with this guy called Victor on the first area, and was sorely beaten, but eventually found a way to knock him off his high horse for his car. It can be frustrating, doing a race several times just to memorize the map. You usually don't have time to look at your map and stay focused, so you will probably play a mission about 5 times until you get the hang of it. Then there are stupid mistakes that you do and the AI won't do. Like miss a turn, which screws you out of the checkpoint, which will make you lose the race. Or hitting a car and losing the lead. The AI never misses the turn, have usually 2 different set routes, and sometimes will screw you bad. Once I was about to win and one of the enemies pulled in front of me, stopped his car, and didn't move for a bit. I noticed all the other racers passed me easily. Then there are the people you race against. They are extremely annoying, constantly telling you stuff about how your driving is terrible or how you need to stop doing something before they get \"mad\". I raced against this guy called Angel, he kept saying stuff through the whole match. I get second place, he gets 7th and he STILL says I am terrible at the end. Even if you beat your opponent but lose to one of the other racers, your opponent will tell you all this stuff about how much you ... I just wanna nail them into a gas pump and watch them explode over and over again. Then once you win you get their car.\nOk so besides the campaign, theres other modes. Arcade mode, which lets you cruise around the environments you've unlocked, and battle mode, which has detonate or capture the flag. They alright. You cannot customize cars in this game, or build your own levels. I would of had so much fun building a straight track that goes for about a quater mile, with other cars lined up watching me race my sister. However, all you can customize are races, and things during the race. Weather, traffic, and daylight. You can set traffic to low, but it still isn't a clear path. Theres online play, which I don't have the card to play it, so I don't know what it's like.\nSo you wanna know what I think? The game is fun, cruise around. Go do some battle mode. Make a race and see how you do. No high scores or anything, but hey, you're here for the adrenaline rush. The game definetly has that, and makes me feel like im in that movie fast and the furious.", "summary": "Great game, lacking just a little.", "unixReviewTime": 1060128000}

Gonzalez", "reviewText": "While Bandai's Monster Party may appear to be just another sidescrolling NES game on the surface, a lot of the actual content is bizarre beyond anything that you'll ever find in any other game. In Monster Party, you play as Mark, who is trying to save a world of monsters from evil, with the aid of a good monster named Bert(!?). While it suffers from poor level design and simplistic boss fights, this game is still quite a sight to see.\n\nThe overall look of Monster Party may appear simplistic. Most of the enemies and objects, as well as the playable characters, are quite small. However, all of the enemies are very unique and there is a good variety of them. They are indigenous to each stage, so you never see palette-swapped enemies. This gives you quite a good variety of monsters, considering the game is eight stages long. Also, each stage has a completely different look to it. The environments range from forests, sewers, and clouds, to ancient Egypt, and even a high-tech tower. But the highlight of the game's graphics are the bosses, which are drawn very well, and very unique. None of the enemies or bosses in this game look like they were ripped from another game. The downside here is the small size of things, and the backgrounds aren't much to look at. Mark and Bert are animated very poorly, and Mark isn't drawn too well. But I still feel that Monster Party's graphics hold a unique charm all their own.\n\nUnfortunately, compared to the graphics, the sound is very primitive. Some of the music is okay, but it epitomizes simplicity and repeats itself way too much. For example, the music in the Egyptian level sounds \"Egyptian\"...but it's only a few notes long, so overall, it doesn't leave a good impression. In Level 6, a howling wind is heard in place of music. Since this level is a maze that can take awhile to get through, the wind effect gets annoying really quickly! The worst music is the boss theme, which is nothing more than a bell going \"ding-ding-ding-ding-ding...\" (A couple of bosses do have a different theme, which is what they could have done for all the bosses, or else composed a better tune.) But the music does have some high points, most notably, the music after you pass the tree in the first level is one of the most haunting NES tunes I've ever heard. (Why didn't they do all the music this well?) Also, the sound effects are quite good! Many of the bosses make a noise when they're hit that's really fitting to them. The cat makes a \"meowing\" noise. The minotaur \"moos\", etc.\n\nThe play control of this game is quite good, which I admit, somewhat surprised me. A lot of times when I find little-known NES action games, the play control leaves much to be desired, but not so in this game. Mark is easy to move around, and jumps easily, too. He jumps pretty high and far, too. Swinging the bat is no problem, either. Bert is also easy to control. His controls are basically the same as Mark's, except he can fly by repeatedly pressing the A button, which of course, is also very easy to do. The only real issue I have with the play control is that Mark's hit range with the bat is VERY small, and you can't always tell if you're close enough to an enemy to hit it or not. Sometimes, I get too close and end up taking an unnecessary hit. When you're transformed into Bert, you can shoot projectiles, which have a much longer range.\n\nThe story goes as such: One day, Mark was walking home, when he noticed a large star in the sky. The star landed in front of him, and turned out to be a flying monster named Bert. (Bert looks something like a cross between a griffon and a gargoyle, wearing knight armor.) Bert asks Mark for help in defeating the evil monsters of his world. Armed with only a baseball bat, Mark agrees, and Bert flies him off to the world of monsters. But before they arrive, Bert \"assimilates\" with Mark so that Mark can \"transform\" into Bert when he finds a special pill. All seems fine and dandy in the world of monsters...until you pass that giant tree..and well, I won't say what happens next! While the story may not seem like anything special, this game is full of humor and atmosphere! Many of the bosses have amusing one-liners, and the game has one of the freakiest endings I've ever seen on the NES. Also, for a game that was released during Nintendo's censorship-happy, \"no blood\" era, this game has buckets of it! (Mind you, it doesn't spray forth from you or the enemies, but you will be seeing a lot of it in the backgrounds of some levels.) Overall, it's not an outstanding story, but it's weird and twisted, especially for an NES game.\n\nUnfortunately, Monster Party lacks any kind of real challenge. The level design is very simplistic. There are very few areas where good jumping skills are required, because you can almost never fall into pits or other hazards. Even in the water level, you can fall into the water, and as long as you keep jumping, you don't take damage. The only level that is somewhat difficult is the Door Maze of level 6, but that's an annoying kind of challenge. Bert makes things even easier, if you get transformed into him. I also think Level 2 was the toughest level for me to get through (not counting the door maze). So why were all the later levels easier? Well, it was mostly because your life bar increases as you go along, and that makes things quite easier. Some of the bosses are challenging, but a lot of them attack in very similar patterns, so you defeat all of them the same way. Most are either defeated by reflecting the things they shoot at you back at them with the bat, or by shooting at them as Bert. Bert makes most boss fights really easy, and some early bosses take many more hits to defeat than the later bosses. The final boss was dead before I even knew it. This doesn't completely detract from the game's enjoyability, but what it means is that experienced gamers will probably beat it very quickly.\n\nDespite the shortcomings in challenge, I still found this game quite fun to play. Going through the levels, themselves, and hacking away at enemies with the baseball bat can become a little tedious, but what made the game so fun was not knowing what manner of boss monster was going to be waiting behind each door I found, and believe me, some of them are quite bizarre! I thought of describing what kinds of bosses there are in this game, but since most of the fun is not knowing what you'll see next, I won't spoil it for you! :) I will, however, mention that you must defeat the bosses of each world in order to obtain a key that gives you access to the next level. If you accidentally pass by a boss door without entering, you can backtrack through the level. Although many of the bosses can be defeated in the same manner, there are a few exceptions. In one case, the boss is already dead when you enter, and in another case, you merely have to watch the bosses dance, rather than fight them. Playing as Bert is fun, too, since he can fly and shoot. Flying gives him the ability to reach some high ledges in some levels, but too bad the levels weren't designed better to take more advantage of Bert's special powers.\n\nIn the final analysis, Monster Party doesn't quite rank up there with the best of the NES classics. But it is a very unique and entertaining game, that is probably like no other in your library. If you're into NES action sidescrollers, and you can find this game cheap, it's definitely worth checking out, if only for the bizarreness factor.

This time they are brought here by a magical pink bunny named Usami who only wants them to live on the island until they bond with each other. Instead, Monokuma shows up and overthrows Usami, changes her appearance, and renames her Monomi. Once again the student's memories of their school life have been taken away. Each retains the memories from before they started school, as well as their Ultimate status- the talent that makes them unique enough to attend Hope's Peak. Once again there is a \"traitor\". Once again, if they want to escape, they have to kill someone in secret and get away with it. Once someone is killed, an investigation starts, and then there is a trial. Pick the wrong killer or make too many mistakes and it's game over and everyone dies. Except the killer. Guess right and the killer is executed.\nThis is very heavily a visual novel, so if you hate to read or find that boring, skip this game. It's reading, walking around and talking to other characters, investigating new places on the island as they unlock after every trial, and getting to know other students in your free time. Spend enough time with them to max out your relationship and get a completed crystal. Once a murder occurs, you investigate the crime scene and other locations for clues. Then you head to the court room to solve the crime by pointing out false statements.\nWhat's new? Differences...\n*New location. A tropical island instead of the school.\n* The addition of a second mascot- a magical girl rabbit who is a good character and not a villain- Usami/Monomi\n*Variation from the first person view. When traveling between the attractions on each area of the island, you know run left or right across the screen to your destination.\n(Your character looks kind of strange with exaggerated long legs, and at fist I hated this new feature, but by the second case you are use to it.)\n*Trial changes allow you to agree with statements instead of just disagreeing/contradicting.\n*A new mini game that I personally thought was annoying where you...snowboard on light beams and avoid drops and choose the side with the right answer. This is not fun, but tedious.\n*There is also a character that immediately emerges as an insane villain pretty early on and hides things from the group. The first game does a much better job of motivating the group to kill, making them desperate to escape- this one does not offer much motivation at all.\n*The ending twist.\nAlthough I really enjoyed this game, and I got used to the new running from point to point, there was one other thing i did not like.  Trying to keep this from being a large spoiler...The ending has a huge twist that makes you like the characters much less, and the one character I really liked ends up dying through no fault of their own. It made the \"game\" seem very unfair to the created \"rules\" and almost feels like a betrayal. In a game where there are executions, we want the killers to deserve to be executed, we don't want them executed for an accidental killing, a set-up, and so on. So up until my favorite character dying undeservedly, and then having a huge twist tossed at us, I was really loving this game. That it what prevents me from giving 5 stars.\nThe old cast also makes an appearance at the end and that's interesting.", "summary": "Story twist not nearly as good as the first, but some new elements that are alot of fun!", "unixReviewTime": 1412553600}

It's pretty much a first person shooter, but without the violence.  Like our son, we also like the fact it makes him think.  It's not just mindless entertainment.  He actually has to think and use reason and logic to get the most watts from each capture.

It's fine if you have an issue with their license enforcement, don't buy the game... But I don't personally care too much. I bought the game for my own use and none of their copy protection methods inconvenienced me in the slightest.\n\nTHE STABILITY\n\nInstalled and ran through the first time without any issues at all. Ran on a fairly pedestrian laptop (Intel C2D 2.66, 4 GB  RAM, nVidia 9650GT mobile) on max settings without any hesitation, crashes, ghosting... Nada. Full stars in this category.\n\nAUDIO / VIDEO\n\nI thought the graphics were decent; Nothing to write home about, but solid enough not to complain. The sound was quite good, right down to an excellent antique soundtrack that contrasted with the mood of the game quite well. A half-star shy in this category.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nI had some initial trouble with the weapon / plasmid switching and keeping up with the foes, so I ran through it the first time on Easy. Now working on Medium. (Easy lives up to its name - I didn't die once.) I made liberal use of [Shift] in order to change weapons and plasmids. This ended up being my MO throughout - especially in the middle of combat. Had to get used to the different ammo types too - awkward but fine once I became accustomed. Overall, a star shy in this category just for the learning curve being so goofy.\n\nSTORY\n\nIn no way or category could the creators have been more draconian, unoriginal, or unimaginative than in the storyboarding process... When they came away with such a trite and heavy handed result, they should have fired their writers and restarted the process from scratch. A good story is the EASIEST part of creating a game and there's just no excuse for screwing it up.\n\nI saw the \"twists\" coming from a mile away... Given the strict linear style of the game (not a problem if done right), I was forced to march directly down their idiotic (to the point of being insulting) predefined path. My reward? The NPCs mock me for being so dense... Right... *eye roll*\n\nIn any case, I suspect folks who enjoy the uber-simple and melodramatic plotlines of comic books will like this story just fine. If you're like me, however, and really detest having stupid crap crammed down your throat, you'll choke on this one for sure. Drama doesn't suffice for intelligence.\n\nFor my purposes, the story was an epic fail with the ONLY saving grace being that the intricate knotwork of interesting NPCs with intersecting storylines made it semi-tolerable. That bumps this category from ZERO stars to one.\n\nOVERALL\n\nNot a bad pick from the bargain bin if you're willing to endure a plot apparently written by the janitor.

It was more of the same every time only, in AC3, you get to buy and sell furniture... and the naval battles.  I loved the naval sequences as it was new and gave you a real sense of adventure.  It got to the point where I would only come back to port if I had to advance the plot and would trudge through that portion just so I could sink more ships at sea when it became available again.  My only other joy from AC3 was the natural conclusion of the Desmond Miles story arc that began with the original AC game in 2007, hoping the franchise would either end or take a radical redirection.\n\nAs if Ubisoft caught wind (ha) of this, but wanted to keep the franchise alive, they poured more money into developing a fourth AC game but with more prominent nautical gameplay and upgraded graphics.  The characters now utilize that facial capture technology that looked really awkward in LA Noire but looks considerably more streamlined and against a backdrop that looks historically authentic and somewhat beautiful.  However, I do not purchase games for the graphics and, after playing AC4 for a month I can say that, while it is tremendously better than AC3, it is still a beating of the dead horse of a franchise for a few extra $$ from a demographic of gamers that go bonkers every time something sporting the names of their favorite franchises gets released.  AC4 is still just another AC game but I think Ubisoft might be onto something with the whole naval aspect but it lost me when it started with the story.\n\nWon't give away the spoilers but the ending of AC3 was the Phoenix for another story arc as you now play a game developer trying to extract memories from Desmond Mile's brain in order to make interactive games.  While the story takes on a more sinister twist it isn't exactly Sixth Sense plot twist surprising and the path leading up to it only made me shake my head as it seemed to parallel Ubisoft staff meetings on \"how to milk a franchise more\" than \"maybe we should make a new franchise.\"\n\nOn top of that, the timeline now backtracks 50 years to the early 18th century in the Spanish Caribbean Isles to romanticize the really unhygienic occupation that is pirating, privateering, and swashbuckling with all the cliches that follow.  Granted it was nice to see a more historically realistic portrayal of Edward Teach (AKA \"Blackbeard\"), who favored intimidation and theatrics over brute force, but the rest seemed rather archetypal or cliche with the only thing missing to complete the image would be a cameo by Douglass Fairbanks.  The overall story seemed weak if not formulaic with the \"templars trying to find artifact A and are stopped by hero B\" theme that persists in... all AC titles and Indiana Jones films.  Oh, and where the warm place did the hero, Kenway, learn to fight like that before joining the Order of Assassins?  Seems a little too convenient as it allows the game to bring in an outsider and not disrupt the gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay, while fun at times, is very repetitive and, often times, annoying sans the naval element.  One seems to spend more time conducting tailing/stealth missions than anything else and, after blowing up a lot of stuff at sea, seems rather counter-balance.  Not to mention such stealth missions should be reserved for Ubisoft's other franchise, Splinter Cell.  It also does not help that the controls for controlling Kenway feel clunky and cumbersome at times particularly when trying to parkour across complex obstacles and overshoot your intended target resulting in a rather nasty steep plunge.  This was something that plagued other AC games and one would think Ubisoft would've figured out how to streamline it by now.  It almost ruins the game.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I loved the sea element and it made the game bearable.  Even the simple aspect of just sailing around was relaxing.  It felt like Windwaker and that's not a bad thing.  Not to mention you can now use your currency to purchase ship upgrades to blow more ships up and that's awesome.  If anything, the naval element could be enough to make a different franchise like Pirate's Creed or Loot and Booty.  Just saying.\n\nAnd then there's the multiplayer.  After spending an hour trying to figure out the co-op only to discover that it only exists in an even more repetitive kill-to-extend-your-time-checkpoint kind of gameplay like a more personal version of Carmageddon.  You choose from several cookie-cutter characters in a menu that is anything but user-friendly, and do repetitive missions.  That's about it.  Never tried the competitive multiplayer as I still do not play well with strangers, but unless you have armada vs armada naval battles, I'll just whistle cheery-o and be on my way.  Seriously, why can't anyone make a decent story co-op mode?\n\nNow, I'm not saying that AC4 is a bad game, far from it.  It's solid in some areas, super awesome in others, but painstakingly lackluster in the bulk of it.  It's derivative, formulaic, and evolutionary but not evolutionary save for the boating sequence that I cannot get enough of.  It was the only saving real grace of the game as I loved sailing around doing stupid maneuvers and practicing my impression of the thrill pig from that one Geico commercial.  (Weeeeeeeeee!)\n\nAll in all, fans of the franchise will drool at the mouth while the general audience will shrug and say, \"it's not bad.\"", "summary": "High Killing on the High Seas:  How Ubisoft Develops a Great Concept while Beating a Dead Horse of a Franchise", "unixReviewTime": 1388448000}

The game is an intense, fast paced, 3rd person, over the shoulder shooter.  Nearly every aspect of this game is perfectly made, the graphics, enemy and weapon designs, facility and world designs are all perfect and beyond flawless.  Additionally, every aspect and detail of this game is crystal clear, crisp, clean and beautifully crafted.\n\nThe story line is awesome and is one of the best on the PSP.  This game takes place between Fall of Man and Resistance 2 and follows a character named Grayson.  Grayson was a British Marine who fought the Chimera, but who was forced to kill his brother who was nearly converted into a Chimera in one of their conversion facilities.  In this game, you find out that Grayson deserts the military and is later caught and sentenced to death, but his assistance is requested by the French resistance forces and he is later spared.  The main character Grayson is absolutely awesome, he has issues with authority, doesn't follow rules, and generally does what the hell he wants.  One of the best scenes is when Grayson tells Mallory that he promises not to blow up the Chimera conversion facility so that she can study it and learn from it, than as soon as she leaves he blows the thing sky high!\n\nThe weapons in this game are absolutely sick!  You will be using the Razor the most which is an assault rifle used by the chimera.  This weapon has great fire, great power, great speed but the accuracy is kind of sucky, additionally in can be charged to shoot a massive spinning blade that does huge damage.  Also, the Auger is awesome it can see and shoot through walls and is super powerful, the only issue with this is that it has such a small clip size.\n\nThe controls on this game are phenomenal, fluid and are super easy to use.  You can look around, up, down every possible direction and can move easily.  My only complaint about this is how slow Grayson moves.  Sometimes you just need to haul as* but it just does not happen.  The control scheme is exactly the same as Syphon Filter: Logan's Shadow, and also includes the ability to hide behind walls.  What makes this one better is that when you are done shooting Grayson automatically jumps back behind the wall, while in Syphon Filter Logan is left like a sitting duck while you try to maneuver back to your hiding place.\n\nThe replay value on this game is also awesome.  There are 4 hidden weapons which you can get by collecting all of the pieces of hidden intel in each level.  Sometimes the intel is easy to spot other times it is a real pain.  Additionally, you can collect skill points which demand you to perform certain actions such as not taking damage, killing 5 enemies with one explosion or killing the final boss in less than 4 minutes.  I do not have 100% skill points so I cant tell you what this unlocks.  Additionally, if you hook up the PSP to your PS3 you can play in \"Infected Mode\" where Grayson is a Chimera, in this mode you regain health over time (in regular game play you have to look for health packs), you can breathe under water and can breathe toxic gas (gad i wish that was the case in regular play).\n\nThe game itself on normal mode is not very difficult, there are not an overwhelming amount of enemies and if you think logically you can kill enemies or groups of them much more easily.  This is awesome as it makes the game accessible to non-gamers like myself.  There is also a hard mode which is to say the least.. f-ing hard.\n\nDefinitely pick up this game, it is awesome, time consuming, exciting and fast paced.  The game is action filled and  you will not want to put it down.  It is utterly addictive.  In my opinion if there is any PSP game to buy, this is the one you need.", "summary": "Review - Resistance Retribution", "unixReviewTime": 1317340800}

New features include Superstar voice overs, online play, new clean/dirty tactics meters, and a few other things.  Now on to the review.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\n-The new Royal Rumble meter makes Royal Rumble matches more exciting and more difficult to win.  In previous Smackdown games the Royal Rumble match was far too easy to win.  The new meter makes you have to push buttons to deplete a superstar's meter and knock them out of the ring.\n\n-The new Dirty/Clean meters award players for using Dirty or Clean tactics during a match respectively.\n\n-One of the few multiplayer titles on the PS2.  If you have 3 or more friends to play this game with then it has a huge fun factor.\n\n-The create a superstar is more customizable than ever.  Though it takes a long time to create a good superstar.\n\n-The AI has improved in many areas and the Legend diffuculty level makes this game a challenge for expert players.  The AI will even suprise you by stealing your own finisher in this game.\n\n-Challenge mode allows you to complete special objectives in matches to earn cash.  A good option over the weak season mode.\n\n-You have to choose from among 5 weight classes for your created superstars.  Each class is dominant in different stats.  No more Super Lvl 100 Created Superstars.\n\nTHE BAD:\n\n-THQ had good intentions with the voice over feature but 90% of the time the superstars sound like they're on Nyquil or something.\n\n-The lineup of superstars is probably the weakest of any smackdown game thus far.  I guess it coincides with the lack of decent superstars in the WWE itself these days.  I agree with the other reviewer, they should've worked harder to get the rights to some better superstars.\n\n-Also just like all other smackdown games, unless you have other people playing with you, this game gets boring pretty quickly.\n\n-The storyline is complete garbage.  You have almost zero control over what happens in the season.  You can no longer choose what superstars are in the season.  After you play it once, you've played it a million times.  The exact same thing will happen over and over again.  If you want to build up your created superstars then you're forced to play through this hell several times.\n\n-Targeting on this game is the worst since the first Smackdown.  In HCTP your player would automatically target the nearest opponent.  This one makes you target the nearest player even if it's your own ally or the referee.  This is very annoying at times.\n\n-Though the AI has improved in some areas, they've become annoying in others.  It takes them forever to eliminate other superstars in a Royal Rumble match.  I was the number 30 superstar in the Season and had to wait well over 30 minutes for the AI to eliminate each other.\n\nTHE UGLY:\n\n-The online feature is what really had me excited about playing this game.  Imagine my disappointment to discover that you could only play a regular SINGLE MATCH or a boring Bra and Panties match online.  With the major advancements going on today in game you would think THQ could bring something more to the table.  So the online feature is basically obsolete.  It's sad really.  This game could've potentially had infinite replay value if it were truly ONLINE.\n\nThis game is good for a group of friends playing multiplayer.  One of the few titles like this you'll find on the PS2.  Unless you're a hardcore wrestling fan and and will buy this game regardless, then I recommend that you rent it a couple of times because it really doesn't last much longer than a few weeks.", "summary": "It's Decent.", "unixReviewTime": 1107475200}

Blizzard spent a good amount of time creating and testing this masterpiece, and it shows off. No matter what type of games you like to play, you'll like playing WoW. Even if your PC isn't blazing fast, you'll get perfect quality out of WoW. Everything in the game just feels right.\n\nLet me split my review into sections;\n\nGRAPHICS\n--------\n\nThe graphics in WoW are a splendor to behold. The textures and geometry are excellent and really show how much detail Blizzard put into this game. The visuals aren't DOOM 3 or Half-Life 2 in extreme quality, but this is a MMO with quite a bit of people and low system requirements. The shadows, weather and particle effects, and 'bonus' graphical work (such as footprints in the snow, etc) are above average. With all the visual settings maxed out, along with my graphic card's hardware AA/AF maxed, the game does not stutter, even on my mid-range PC. I'm amazed I can have everything maxed, having my screen look gorgeous, and have perfect v-sync frame rates constantly.\n\nSOUND/MUSIC\n--------\n\nMusic in WoW is, of course, spectacular. Blizzard is known for having awesome scores that are dynamic and suiting. There's a ton of different scores that dynamically change depending on where you are and what's going on, and they're all near-godly and memorable. The sound design is also great: each individual sound effect and voice sounds like what it should. No complaints in the sound department.\n\nSERVERS\n--------\n\nBlizzard has a good amount of servers setup. Quite a lot of them, in fact. Not only that, but there's specific servers for PvP, so you can be on one of those if you enjoy dueling. PvE servers can have PvP game play as well, but both parties need to agree beforehand. The servers are lightning fast and I've yet to have downtime.\n\nCOMMUNITY\n--------\n\nSo far, I've experienced a nice community in-game. I've played three different races and the communities in each of them (almost each race has its own starting location in the world of the game) have been very nice, considerate, and helpful. Granted, not everyone acts as they should, but I've had an enjoyable time with the community so far.\n\nINTERFACE\n--------\n\nI really can't think up a way Blizzard could improve WoW's interface. It's mildly complex and takes a bit to get used to, but once you get over those first minutes it feels like second nature. Chatting is simple and fun, with numerous functions. Everything about the game is clearly described, explained, labeled, and shown in the manual and in-game. There are also tips that help you with just about everything as you experience it the first time.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n--------\n\nThe most important part of a game and WoW does it great. There's so much to do in the GIGANTIC world that you won't want to stop. Just a few of the 'professions' you can do: cooking, fishing, mining, blacksmithing, first aid, and alchemy. Besides all those you can just do the 2000+ quests, level up your character, join groups, create or join a guild, and more. It really is like an online world, and it's addicting. The quests range from extremely simple to very advanced, with plenty to choose from. The races are distinct but balanced, and each one has its own feel and flavor. The classes are well balanced also (except for Warrior, which is pretty underpowered, but Blizzard has said they're already working on it for the next patch). There's enough classes and races to suit anyone's taste, and there's definitely enough so that you can have multiple, different characters without feeling bored. The pace of the game feels just right; not too fast, not too slow. Death isn't a huge hassle, quest rewards are actually rewarding, the races are cool and different, the classes are exciting and aren't disappointments or unbalanced, the game is as simple or nearly-overwhelmingly complex as YOU want it to be, Blizzard's support is fantastic, and there isn't a single feature left out of the game. In a word: perfection.\n\nAll in all, WoW is definitely one of the best gaming experiences I've had, and I haven't even come close to experiencing it all. If you like Blizzard's previous games, role-playing games, and/or other MMOs, you'll love WoW for sure. Even if you don't like those, there's still a very high chance of you falling in love with it, since it's just so damn fun to play.\n\nThe monthly fee is well worth the countless hours of bliss you'll receive, and they provide discounts when you pay in bulk, like 3-months and 6-months.\n\nI recommend buying the strategy guide (more like strategy tome, it's over 400 pages!) if you're new to MMOs, since there's a lot to learn. The game's manual is thick too, and there's plenty of in-game and online resources available.\n\nIf you can find it, purchase the Collector's Edition since for $30 more you get quite a lot (the game on 4 CDs, the game on 1 DVD, the soundtrack, a large making-of book, an exclusive in-game 'pet,' and more).\n\nWorld of Warcraft is a game I very highly recommend for everyone to buy and experience, even gamers who don't like online play.\n\nGET WORLD OF WARCRAFT NOW!", "summary": "Best MMORPG Ever -- Buy NOW!", "unixReviewTime": 1102032000}

The game made us run around through each of the announced levels to get started and once we got to Mickey it opened up to where you could select which stage to play. We put Mr. Incredible on the pad with Sully and tried to play Sullys game. It said over and over waiting for player two to connect, but never gave the second player the option to join. I tried to play Sully's stage solo and he just sat there. No way to control it.

However, once I received the game I couldn't help but to be very upset at critics that rated this game low.\n\nThis game has so many new innovations that it's surprising that the release didn't get pushed back even further. The graphics are so beautiful and take full advantage of the PS3 in every regard. The music soundtrack and storyline are good too.\n\nThe best part of this game and something that can't be done on any other game system is the real time air battles and ground battles that take place simultaniously. The cell processor is the only hardware that can handle this type of extreme gaming.\n\nThe controls to the game are very smooth. Once the user gets used to using six axis (It took me about 15 to 20 minutes to stop using the joysticks every now and then lol) the game goes to an entirely new level. The camera is flawless, the cutscenes are great, and the fighting controls are great. The coolest part about airbattle is takedown when you can defeat an enemby dragon in 50 different ways and all are cool and a treat to watch and play through.\n\nThe boss battles in the game are tough enough to make the player look for strategy and yet they aren't easy to where the user will never die like in the new Zelda game for the Wii (Not to say that is bad, just that it is too easy).\n\nThe game challenges the player and also forces the player to replay a level in order to get a higher score (bronze, silver, or gold). The game isn't as long as other games, but the gameplay is soooo fun that this is completely made up for. I got about 6 to 8 hours out of the game (about the same as Rainbow Six: Vegas).\n\nThis is a must buy for all gamers who love the PS3, dragons, old time battles, and strategy, all along with beautiful graphics and flawless design.\n\nDon't judge the game just because of a control setting. It was advertised this way and a player shouldn't buy it if they aren't into motion control. In my own opinon I don't think the game could be nearly as great if it was made any other way.", "summary": "The Game is a lot better than critics rate it!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1189555200}

My preference for online games are those lush in aesthetic detail, with involved combat, and which are readily accessible to both casual and hardcore gamers. I had long felt FFXI was sorely lacking on the last of those two marks, but had a great deal of both scenic and narrative detail. My hopes that XIV would remedy the ills of XI and improve upon its better qualities never materialized in the finished product. XIV is a shallow game, glutted with repetition, a cumbersome user interface, and a combat and crafting system both tedious and ungratifying.\n\nXIV's world, Eorzea, is massive even to other Final Fantasy entries. Unfortunately, one quickly finds that the terrain is almost ceaselessly unvarying. The starter regions are, befitting to Final Fantasy's emphasis on graphical beauty, impressive. But one look is all one needs to have seen the full extent of any of these areas, or any of those a player will later come upon. There are no areas that break up the unremitting terrain, like WoW's forests, lakes, camps, villages, etcetera, and no alteration to the single loop of music as you travel. Monsters too, though they change in name and level, rarely change in models. More disappointing are the starter city's, especially Limsa Lominsa, which looks blocky and unfinished. Ul'Dah is a drab city built like a race course, moving in circles through corridors of recurrent grays and browns. Despite being more functional and easier to travel than XI's starter cities, they lack any memorable character or life, especially when compared to more contemporary MMORPGs. The setting is only complimented by an interesting storyline, a rarity amongst most online games.\n\nGameplay is FFXIV's most pivotal failure. Leveling a class, which is determined by the weapon you have equipped, is done purely by grinding mobs or performing a limited set of quests. These quests are truly the only viable way to progress, but an individual is restricted to how many they may take in a real 24 hour period. Even when these quests, the so-called `guild leves,' are meant to be difficult and attempted only with a group, they end quickly and require little skill. They are also exceedingly unoriginal, requiring killing x amount of mobs or collecting x amount of items. You've seen the full gambit of quests by the time you're in your teen levels, but are forced to repeat them if you've any intention of leveling further. Crafting, which is markedly improved from XI, is also needlessly complex, risky, and boring. Progressing as a craftsman will entail a great many failures. Your skill level has a bearing on your chance of success, but a prevailing capriciousness within the system seems to work against you more than not. Buying and selling goods crafted or not, is truly cumbersome. There is no auction house, nor a way to search for items.\n\nUltimately, XIV is a disappointing, exceedingly shallow game with a limited variety of eye candy and a few glimpses of a good story holding it up. I played since closed beta, gave it a few months in public, and have canceled my account; I can't see any reason to hold out for an improvement.", "summary": "A sad attempt at an online RPG.", "unixReviewTime": 1289779200}

You could abandon following the main storyline and still be able to play for many hours. One of the main side missions is killing Orc captains. Even though it is only a side mission, they are also incorporated in the main missions. Shadow of Mordor also has many unique ways it presents battle. You are able to drain energy out of enemies, which you use to power up your bow, which has ghost like power. You can also grab enemies and are given three options: draining the enemy, shanking them, or interrogation. Interrogation gives you intel about Orc captains. In order to grab a captain, you have to wear them down in battle first, and they give you intel about Orc War chiefs.  Side missions are similar to Assassin's Creed. They follow rescuing slaves, completing a certain number of stealth kills, or things in that area.\nMain storyline follows various tasks that connect back to the main book and movie series, with characters like Gollum and references to Wraiths. The game will not only satisfy fans of the LOTR series, but also those who have never even seen the movie.

The early pictures were awkward, asymmetrical, kind of ugly, my expectations were low.

Yes, it still looks kind of awkward installed, but you quickly forget (and cease to care) once you start playing with it. The best way to describe it is that it feels like a console controller in your hands, has a nice, natural curve on the bottom that rests naturally in your hands, plus it also adds a bit more thickness that helps eliminate hand cramping (a particular problem if you have larger hands like I do). In addition to the extra circle pad, it also adds 2 lower trigger buttons directly below the shoulder buttons, for a Sixaxis or Xbox like feel. It gives the 3DS a hugely upgraded feel and play experience. The added size does cut down on portability a bit, but if you keep it in a backpack or briefcase anyway, it really shouldn't affect you much. I initially worried that the \"off center\" screen/stick layout would be awkward/distracting, but I honestly have to say, after 10 seconds of game play I didn't even notice it, not an issue at all. I also like that the control menu within RE Revelations allow you to easily calibrate & adjust the response speed of the 2nd stick to your liking. I agree with many people that Nintendo messed up by not incorporating a 2nd stick into the original 3DS design, however, I respect them for admitting their mistake and coming out with an inexpensive solution that hugely upgrades the game play.", "summary": "A Pleasant Surprise!", "unixReviewTime": 1328745600}

The main character is basically a wall without any actual opinions of her own and the male characters are all abusive and manipulative. You have the option of telling your love interest to shove it when he's being an ass but it leads to a worsening relationship and a bad ending.\n\nApparently the only way to get a good ending is to be submissive and agreeable no matter what and I wasn't interested in those choices. I would rather live with amnesia than put up with the condescending insults and outright abuse the love interest exhibited towards my character.\n\nIt sends a bad message to female players and male players alike. No woman should put up with that crap and there should be an option to break up with your love interest and reclaim your memories without having submit to any toxic masculinity.\n\nI don't want to sound preachy or offended but it was hard to get lost in a romantic story when you're constantly questioning why your character would've fallen in love with such a jerk of a character in the first place.\n\nIt wasn't my favorite otome. I recommend Hakuoki, Code Realize or Norn9 over this game.", "summary": "Obnoxious love interests", "unixReviewTime": 1479859200}

This model is superior to the other models in many ways, the key one is that it offers HARDWARE based backwards compatibly(It basically has a PS2 inside the PS3) that plays over 99% of games (not 100% like some people will say) The PS3 can also 'upscale' PS1 and PS2 games, on some PS2 games the graphical difference will be very minimal, on other it will be a big step up, On PS1 games it will eliminate a lot of the 'jaggies' that are apparent in a lot of the 3D games.\n\nLike I mentioned earlier, The 60&20GB offer 99%BC Only one game in my PS2 collection did not work, that one being Orphen. I have experienced some minor trouble with PS1 games but they are just minor graphical hiccups that don't affect the game in anyway.\n\nGood games for the PS3 have been few and far between for awhile, but this years line up seems to be promising for the PS3 (white knight story,Final Fantasy Versus 13-to name a few) However I wish there were more exclusives to the PS3 to justify it higher price (why buy a $400-$500 system with the same games as the $300 system? -c'mon Sony get your act together!)\n\nAnother cool feature of the PS3 is it allows you to change the HDD yourself (does not void warranty) It uses a laptop HDD and can support the biggest size available at the moment 500GB!!\n\nFirmware updates for the PS3 have been somewhat of a nightmare for Sony with the 2.40+ versions, There forum has a lot of upset people who have to pay $150 to get there system fixed because a FW update has crashed there system. My recommendation would be to download the updates to a flash drive and then update the PS3 via the flash drive as people who have been getting crashed all download Via the PS3...\n\nWell thats about all I have to say for now, overall this is a very good system although the older 60&20GB models command a much higher price now, I'd say your best alternative would be to get a 80GB BC model it uses software to play the PS2 games witch lets you play 97% of PS2 games (no longer in production but are cheaper than the 60gig model)", "summary": "The Way Sony's PS3 Was Meant To Be", "unixReviewTime": 1273881600}

The disc is NOT included with the console. While I have no problem with this, people with slower internet speeds may be disappointed. With this being a 40gb game, it takes quite a while to download. Even if you have 30Mbps internet, it will take you around 3 hours to download, and that assumes all 30Mbps are going towards the download.

There is blood and mature language, but it's in the style of of what you may have seen in the Kill Bill films. This game is totally over the top and it's funny.  It's all about the intense combat, strange characters, witty dialog, wicked sense of humor and overall visual anime-style look of the game.\n\nThere are tons of combat maneuvers you can perform with the Wiimote and Nunchuck.  Make sure to do the beginning tutorial as once you are done, you will have the controls figured out.  The combat is a mix of sword fighting with wrestling type maneuvers (Suplex, Piledriver, Powerslam, etc).  The combat never gets boring due to all the variations and moves you can perform (and upgrades). You can charge up your sword swings, stun, block, evade, grab and throw along with combos. It's incredibly refreshing and fun.  When you defeat an enemy using a finishing move, little slots at the bottom of the screen start to spin (like a mini jackpot machine) and if you match three slot icons, you will go into 1 of 5 special uber modes for a short period of time. Very cool and different.\n\nAfter defeating the first boss (shortly after the beginning tutorial), you won't have enough money to pay the Entry Fee of the next Boss fight. So, you will have to do side-jobs, free fight and assassination missions to earn money. You drive your motorcycle around the city to get to the various jobs and missions and stores.  I want to point out that this \"over world\" is strictly to allow you to get from mission to mission or various shops and it's not intended to be like Grand Theft Auto where it's an open \"sandbox\" where you can do anything you want. But, after defeating the second and third bosses, you will find that there is a lot to do in the city as quite a bit is opened up to you by then.\n\nYou can customize your character by going to the clothing store (named Area 51) and purchasing new T-shirts, Jackets, Jeans, Belts and Sunglasses.  You can purchase beam Katana upgrades or different types of Katana's from Naomi's lab. You can upgrade your character by learning new wrestling grapple moves (learn by renting videos). There is even a fitness club where you upgrade your strength, health and amount of combos you can pull off. What is unique is that it makes you do all the training movements like lifting the Wiimote and Nunchuck as if they are fitness equipment (Dumbbell, Squats, Bench Press and more).\n\nThere are a few hidden items to find by exploring the environment such as  Lovikov Balls (used to increase your abilities at a trainer) and money.\n\nYou can go back to your motel and just hang out and put on different clothing and watch videos (first one available is the original trailer for the game). You can go to the video store (Beef Head Video) and purchase other videos.\n\nDefinitely check this game out. NOTE: After you defeat the second boss, a lot of stuff opens up for you to do in the environment - basically, the game keeps giving you more to do after each boss - you will not get bored.  This game has style and personality and you will have not played anything like this before. It's that original.

Pretty much all of Doom 3 took place inside industrial corridors. While you'll see a lot of that in Quake 4 you also experience spacious outdoor environments and varied indoor environments. This helps keep the game from feeling repetitive.\n\nThe sound is a top notch production. The score is great. It gives the game a hollywood movie feel to it. The voice acting is quite believable, and there's a perfect amount of communication happening between you and the other marines.\n\nIn my opinion, the game has 2 flaws. One is the AI, and the other is the multiplayer options. The AI is a bit too basic. They shoot at you, and dodge, but not much else. There have been times where i've hid behind a pillar and shot at them from a certain angle where they couldn't hit me and they wouldnt move at all, allowing me to kill them without being hit at all.\n\nThe multiplayer options are pretty ho-hum. There's an incredible amount of competition with online FPS and so many types of game styles, and you cant expect every game to create a revolutionary new style to the genre, but it would have been nice to see something new and fresh.\n\nBut I bought this game for the single player experience and it delivers. I think it's definately worth the price its going for right now.", "summary": "Well worth the price tag!", "unixReviewTime": 1148428800}

The world itself has a lot going on for it. There is plenty to explore and gaze at if you just pause to look around. Detail is everywhere and it really helps with immersion into the game.\n\n Storyline 5/5 they spent time developing a story that gives you options and keeps you following along instead of just leveling and doing mundane quest to end game level. The world changes and the quest line progresses so that in itself is engaging enough to keep you replaying the game trying different characters for different questlines.\n\nGameplay 3/5 It's flashy and simple but not very challenging. Compared to GW1 where people complained it was too hard (believe me it could be dreadfully hard) this game holds your hand. It's hard to be killed when fighting normal level bosses. The game is much more generous to you as it has no Death penalty. When before if you were killed on a hard boss it only became worse as you lost about 10% max health each time. The game is very forgiving now and that takes away from the challenge that Guildwars used to offer.\n\nGameplay Part 2cont. 3/5 the skill sets you use are very watered down from the old format of building a unique set of skills. Each character has 5 main moves and 5 secondary moves. The main attacks alter between weapons and the secondary attacks you can pick and choose. There is a lot less freedom than before when having hundreds of skills and combinations to choose from. That is a main drawback for those that enjoyed the variety of the old game. As there are different skills and weapons there is a set number of skills that you use and after the 100monster or so you kill it's quite redundant. For other games no big deal for guildwars it's a kick down from what we once had.\n\nThe game community 2/5! As an MMO the idea is to play along with other players. Over time this concept has changed from people being sociable to Soloquesting Online. Most players in GW2 play alone and rarely interact with other players unless they need too. There are guilds as this is \"GuildWars\" but despite the name it's never been \"Guild\" dependent unless you were doing PVP. I haven't gotten too far into PVP yet but plan to engage in that later when my computer is better capable to handle the lag.\n\nThe games community is there but it's non existent as most people just stay to themselves. Even in guilds people will do their own independent tasks and join up for a mission or dungeon and that's about it. So maybe it's a change in MMO behavior or the idea that MMO's are no longer that interesting and new anymore since the idea of playing with someone else online is rather old now there just isn't a need for grouping or playing with other players. For myself as well as old guild wars players its a bit of a let down. After years of playing in instanced worlds with NPC's you finally get a true MMO of your favorite game only to have the actual players run around not engaging with other people and just soloing content. At points I found myself wishing for the Questing NPC's back just so I wouldn't have to quest alone and be so bored. So what are all these people doing? They're \"farming\" which means they're running around to map area's and gather materials to get achievements and make items later on. When people say this game is a \"gear grind\" It's those people that are doing it. The truth is that this game is not a \"gear grind\" it's just the behavior those people choose to engage in when playing this game. They choose to not really be social, they choose to rush the game by not exploring or experiencing the content but just getting from point A to point B, and they choose to make the game all about getting the next piece of equipment. The reality is that the game is amazingly large and detailed and as I said before there is a lot to take in and discover beyond the points of interests listed on the map.\n\nIn the past I made the mistake of blaming the game itself for being boring or tedious and casting these people into the grind of this mundane behavior but the truth is that these people do it to themselves. In just about all of these MMO's that have come out. The get into the concept of turning a game into a chore and they stick with it no matter what game they play. Rush to max level, grind for the best armor, then complain about being bored. The community is very different from the old GW community that wasn't so much \"grind\" oriented but \"game\" oriented. If you quested you quested well, if you PVP'd you PVP'd well, You were just playing the game and not necessarily chasing accomplishments they just came with it. The concept of the old GW community is completely gone in the new world. It's been modernized to cater to the grinding crowd which isn't very enjoyable because they never add any substance to the game other than their characters solemnly playing in the background.\n\nThe world of Guild Wars 2 really feels split. On one hand you have the backdrop to a great story and goodtimes but on the other hand you have a community that doesn't want to engage in those things. It's somewhat like driving to an amusement park and instead of getting on any of the rides you just walk around the park looking at idle roller coasters and decide to pick dandelions laying about instead. No one seems to take advantage of what the game is offering instead they choose to turn the game into something that's not fun at all to play.\n\nOverall my opinion of the game after some time in it has me not disliking GW2 but coming to the realization that the MMO phase of gaming has come and gone because the mindset of the current players has changed it.", "summary": "I just think the age of MMO's has come and gone.", "unixReviewTime": 1345852800}

EA clearly took notice of the widespread disappointment in last year's NCAA and Madden games --and even though they'd never admit it, that they got knocked-out by challenger ESPN.\n\nThe good news is, that their NCAA line of games is usually the model for the pro game to follow in the same year.  If this holds true, then Madden 2006 will be the best football sim game ever.  From the gameplay to the graphics, to the minor \"role-play\" aspects of the game, NCAA 2006 is flat out fun!\n\nGone is the arcade gameplay silliness of the prior year.  My only complaint --and this is very minor, is that the player creation graphics look a little cartoonish.  The model appears to be a bit stocky and short with a slightly too large head.  Thankfully, this does not exist in the in-game and on-field graphics which loook amazing.\n\n*Finally* EA has reversed last year's dumbed-down gameplay and silly ugly graphics that looked like they were meant for Dragonball-Z fanboys.

I love it, I love how it works, I love the time you spend playing it and I love how nothing is explained to you. If you're not into figuring things out and all you want to do is run around and shoot things, this is definitely not for you. It's a very deliberate and focused journey that you make for yourself across a fairly gigantic map with an obscene amount of things to do. I've probably put in around 25-30 hours and I still haven't gone to Diamond City, which is one of the first story line missions you receive.\n\nThis game is almost wholly about exploring. You need to find all kinds of trash and junk (and I do mean all kinds, and it's everywhere) around the map to create everything from weapon parts to actual buildings, to armor modifications to recruitment beacons for the settlements you set up. There is honestly so much to go out and find it can be daunting if you're not ready to narrow your focus.\n\nI'm also personally a huge fan of the combat system. It's a combination of a standard shooter and a targeting system that slows down time to give you an opportunity to choose what to do and what to aim at; it's very unique and adds a lot of depth to the strategy. It can be really challenging if you can't figure it out or insist on trying to play it like Call of Duty. That simply won't work at all.\n\nI've read the 1 and 2 star reviews for the game and I think they're kind of hilariously exaggerated, like a 5-year-old wrote them. The graphics are fine; someone wrote they look \"pre-2007\" and I think they need to go back in time to what 2007 looked like. The other big complaint I saw was that the game is paced slowly and \"you don't do anything.\" The gameplay isn't and hasn't been a secret, so I'm not sure what it was supposed to be like. And lastly, there is a defined story, but it's only one small part of the game as a whole. You can replay this as an entirely new character beating everything utilizing a different skillset and making different choices that there really shouldn't be a linear story. Those are stale, one and done and usually not very good.\n\nNote - I also haven't experienced any major bugs yet, but I'm sure they're there. Bethesda is kind of known for that. Mama Murphy completely disappeared from my current game when I built her chair in the first town (it'll make sense if you play) one time out of 3.

One of the many things that really killed the game for me is , the crybaby settlers , even after you get 120 on defense , they whine and cry about them getting robbed by raiders , even after I equip most of them with mini guns and or rocket launchers with a lot of ammo. This is the problem over and over , the game programmers should do something better than the same old fall back to quests lines. After doing this at least a hundred times of the same , raids by raiders or gunners , you would get the point after a few times and move on. Same crappy default over and over , also what killed it is the \" Fight til the last breath \" default , unlike Fallout 3 , when someone get's wounded they retreat and hide. Mostly raiders or Talon Company does this, but every damn raider or gunner fights to the death ? people don't act that way in combat , no matter if it is 200 years in the future or today, when numbers of allies drop down , the enemy should retreat , in this game never , but the settlers will retreat , but not raiders or gunners , which makes the game even more redundant with the same object lesson over and over , the raiders are tougher , the settlers weaker , question is how the settlers made it to adult life with that kind of wimp attitude? And the same taunts over and over , is also annoying ,\" Come out your dead\" , coming from a raider that lost all 8 or 9 of his allies , this never say die BS is what it is. So the programmers need to make it more enjoyable with a little more on the opponents , more life in some , retreat or surrender option would be cool \" Holy **** , this guy killed my crew , I'm out of here!\" , that would be more cool than \" I done this a 100 times rookie!\" when you got gunner bodies laying around and your storming his last line of defense with Strong with you , if you see a super mutant with a power armor vault dweller charging past your dead friends you would think twice on your next move or sentence.

There are more rock music in 2016 than that old crap , spend a little money for Christ sakes , you cheap bastards , you made a billion on this damn thing , spend a little on music rights to make the sound track more interesting than this dry hipster garbage.

This news is especially good for those who like me have been long time followers of the series. I don't want to give away storyline specifics so I'll just give the general description of the story. Sora and Riku received a message at the end of Kingdom Hearts II which, as it turns out requested that they return to Yen Sid's tower because King Mickey and his friends are in desperate need of his help. There is an impending danger that our heroes will need to face and in order to do this they must gain a new power by taking the Mark Of Mastery exam. Which for our heroes is more like a trial by fire than an ordinary exam because in order to pass they must awaken seven sleeping worlds.\n\n  Now I'll move on to gameplay. Starting in Traverse Town we are introduced to a game mechanic known as flow motion. Flow motion makes the environment around you more interactive which can especially come in handy during battles. How it does this is for example you can slide down rails and bounce off walls ti create a more powerful finishing move. (For those of you who might be interested it is in Traverse  Town that Neku and the gang from The World Ends With You make their epic cameo). Another important gameplay mechanic is the use of Spirits, In terms of how the game is played your personal dream eater spirits take the place of Donald and Goofy who worked as Sora's sidekicks in previous titles. it is important to a)Make sure they don't die. b)Make sure you bond and interact with them. c) Make sure you dream link with them which depending on which character your currently playing with results in either Sora teaming up for powerful attacks or Riku's own attacks becoming more powerful. Finally, d)make sure you level up the ability links which gives both the Spirits and your characters new abilities. The third new game mechanic which at times can be the most frustrating is the addition of the \"drop gauge.\" This mechanism leads to the forced switching between the Characters Of Riku and Sora. Although. at times dropping can be rather seamless between the characters I learned the hard way that you must keep your eye on the gauge before starting a boss fight or even a mini boss fight. I can't tell you how many times I was dropped when only one or two hits away from defeating a boss only to have to start over when dropped back to the character. The last gameplay mechanic I want to discuss is reality Shift. Reality Shift much like flow motion allows for further interaction with each world's environment. From the simplistic barrel throwing of Traverse Town to the interactive comic reality shift of The Three Musketeers world,\n\n  Overall, I really love this game and in my opinion it puts Kingdom Hearts back on the map. I love the fact that even though it all connects to the game's storyline overall we get two perspectives and two different portions of the story of each world via Sora and Riku's respective visits. My favorite world was La cite Des Cloches where we meet the cast of The Hunchback Of Notre Dame, In terms of the storyline it was a segment in which I enjoyed both perspectives. Aesthetically I most loved Symphony of Sound A.K.A. Fantasia world. It was so bright and colorful. The reality shift I enjoyed most is in The Three Musketeers world where you can beat some enemies through an interactive comic strip. My least favorite world is as in previous KH games Monstro I always get so lost in there!\nI recommend the game to any KH fan, After the abomination that was Re Coded we all so deserved this.", "summary": "Kingdom Hearts revived", "unixReviewTime": 1345248000}

Moore", "reviewText": "First, this is not a Final Fantasy game. That is not a criticism it is a fact. I like this game. I like Final Fantasy. I like pizza and comic books but they are not the same thing. Put the title \"Pizza\" on a comic book and you still couldn't eat it. Ignore the name and move on.\nSecond, the game is designed for multi-player and most of the reviews that I have read assume multi-player participation. I do not. Even if you can find 3 friends with GBA's and link cables, getting them together for more than a few hours at a time, will be problematic at best. I think that all RPG's need a multi-player (especially 2 player) option but this game's multi-player is designed for a \"party\" of players. That will be difficult for most Cube owners to manage.\nI begin with the assumption that, like me, you'll be playing \"Crystal Chronicles\" solo.\nThis is an action game. You move from area to area trying to clear levels. More like a 3D fighting game in structure than an RPG. The closest thing I can compare it to on the Cube is: \"Gauntlet, Dark Legacy\". That being said, the game does have a little more depth than \"Dark Legacy\" and will keep you coming back, that is if the action fighting aspect doesn't put you off immediately.\nAfter you complete 3 levels (areas) the game year ends. This provides the structure for the \"story\" in the game. As you move from area to area on the \"world map\" your journey will be interrupted by random encounters, but not combat encounters. These are story snippets, little pieces of information that move the game's \"plot\" along. They are random, and sometimes they repeat. But, key segments change from year to year so that the longer you play, the more of the story is revealed.\nYou do not discover the story by running around and interacting with the in game characters, very little of this sort of thing is required at all. The story plays out for you as you go along and you get to watch it happen, but you don't make it happen.\nThe story bits are beautiful to behold, as are the levels. This is the prettiest game I have ever seen. And, at first this was the only thing that kept me coming back. Eventually, however, I did find myself committed to the growth of my character and interested in seeing what the story would show me next.\nEven playing solo, I found that I could build my character enough to manage all the levels (and I am NOT a dexterous gamer). You build up your character by getting money and buying better equipment, there are no class levels at all. But your equipment can be improved even early in the game. I do enjoy this game very much. It is playable for a solo gamer and the story bits are entertaining.\nI have clocked just over 20 hours on the game and feel that it is money well spent, however the game had to, \"grow on me.\" At first I didn't like the game. I'm an RPG game fan - this game isn't that. I'm a Final Fantasy fan. This game isn't that.\nThe game is a 3D version of a fighting side scroller of old.

You don't need to speak that loud, despite the distance the mic is from your mouth.\n\nAs far as build quality goes, it's a pretty great quality. The plastic is much glossier than the pictures imply (my only issue), but it doesn't seem to attract fingerprints that well - so there's that. It is sturdy and doesn't make too much noise when flexed. It doesn't have the heft I was looking for, but I'm sure I'll be thankful for that during longer gaming sessions.

The foam on the ear pieces is pretty comfortable and snug and didn't make me sweat (heat cranked in the winter) like other headsets have... It just feels... Goooood...\n\nI recommend this to anyone in need of a headset, for any system. I will offer this warning, however - do NOT use the software that comes with the headset.

Don't get me wrong!  But I can point exactly to a couple of major problems with the game that reduce the appeal in my estimation.  Mainly the lack of RPG elements gets in the way of an otherwise enjoyable experience.  Here is why:\n\nThere are battle encounters.  But since the only real benefit to battles is acquiring coins, you really don't need to fight the baddies.  Add to this the fact that coins are mostly used to buy stickers to use in battle... see where this is going?  You might be thinking you need some stickers for the boss battles, but really you can find these stickers scattered around.  So really, one could spend the entire game avoiding battles for the most part.  I feel that if there was some sort of RPG style growth (as in the other Mario RPG / Paper Mario games) then this would have been more complete.  Perhaps some way to grow or power up stickers or attack.  Or add more pages that way?  I'm sure something could have been figured out.\n\nBut regardless, the exploration factor is great.  Granted, there are some issues with the exploration, such as very easy puzzles that really don't add anything to replay.  But the environments are gorgeous in the very 'Mario' genre style.  Getting around is fun, and I actually found myself looking forward to seeing the next areas.  The world is divided into 1-1, 1-2, 2-1 and so on, but within these 'stages' there is free exploration.\n\nTo sum it up, this is a mild puzzle / exploration game with a few light RPG elements.  You find or buy stickers which you use to attack enemies.  The battles can be interesting thanks to some clever designs (example - the pointy goombas cannot be stomped, so use hammer or fire flower or shell - or battles when one koopa troopa is in front of several goombas then you can stomp the troopa and kick its shell into the goombas).\n\nReally a fun game.  It lacks replay because once you figure it all out, playing through again becomes a chore of just completing the same puzzles over again.  But great for at least one play through.  Not a great successor to the Mario RPG franchise (Mario RPG -> Paper Mario).  But an interesting game nonetheless.\n\nPros:\n+ Great 3D, gorgeous graphics\n+ Good soundtrack, catchy Mario style tunes\n+ Humor - it's as funny as the rest of the Mario RPG / Paper Mario games\n+ Lots of exploration and hidden areas\n+ Some fun classic Mario elements and designs\n\nCons:\n- Lacks RPG elements\n- Lacks depth and replay\n- Collecting stickers to use in battle becomes dull\n- Easy to avoid the majority of enemies with no penalty", "summary": "Gorgeous 3D, but lacking in other areas ~", "unixReviewTime": 1357689600}

I'm a man in my early thirties now, so when I grew up, I grew up on Nintendo.  Sure, there was a bit of Atari action going on a little before that, but when Mario presented his mustached self, I never looked back. That very fact alone has a lot to do with the fondness I now look over Nintendo's latest incarnation; the Wii.  Much has been made over the years about how it's the lesser of the next gen consoles, what with it's subpar graphics and kiddie games.  All of us Nintendo lovers have had to put up with the scene where one of our acquaintances who loves to play Call of Duty asks us if we play on XBox live and we respond, \"No, we have a Wii.\"  Suddenly we can see the person begin to look down their noses at us as they begin to talk in a fake superior British accents about how they're sorry that we're stuck with an inferior gaming system and suddenly I feel like I have to apologize that my gaming doesn't fit their standards of gaming.\n\nThat's when I have to stop myself, look them in the eye and say \"Yep, stinks to be me.  All those hours of fun I've had playing Mario Galaxies and Zelda and Metroid Primes have obviously been a huge waste of my valuable gaming time.  I see the light.\"  Pause to let the sarcasm sink in and go about my business.  Perhaps fire Mario Kart up when I get home.  The point is simply this, going in we knew the Wii wasn't going to have knock out realistic HD graphics.  And frankly, we didn't care.  We believed in Nintendo because of years of top quality games.  The motion controls are fun on the games that do get them right, but if they aren't your thing, most of the time you don't have to use them.  I myself think the motion controls are pretty cool.  Unfortunately, a lot of games didn't realize how to incorporate them and you ended up with a lot of games that degenerated into waggle fests.  But you pick up a game like Metroid Prime 3, where motion controls take an already awesome gaming experience and shoots it to the next level, then it was worth it.\n\nSure, we saw a lot of sewage drenched filth come out on the system and had to wade through a lot of uninspired junk to find some jewels.  But when we did, wow, how refreshing was it to play those games.  This is an incarnation of Nintendo that has seen three top tier Mario Games, two Legend of Zeldas, and two Metroids.  How many generations of Nintendo consoles can boast that, apart from the original?  And graphics?  They may not have been photo realistic, but the good games that knew how to work with them and give us good art design with vibrant colors really looked great.  Take a look at the Galaxy Marios or even Mario Kart.  You could play a new Ghostbusters game on PS3 or XBox 360 that looked like you were watching a movie, or you could play a version on the Wii that looked like a slick cartoon that made you FEEL like a Ghostbuster.\n\nTo me, that's what makes the Wii a success.  The fun of the games.  And yes, they weren't all kiddie games.  Try out the bloody No More Heroes or MadWorld and you'll find some slick no small kids allowed violence you'll be shocked to find on a Nintendo system.  Even first person shooters; while missing the photo real HD graphics, they control like a dream with the Wiimote/Nunchuck combo.  Point and shoot.  Super accurate.  Not everybody is a \"hardcore\" super gamer.  There are some, like me, that grew up on the Nintendo brand that love those original games and love to play the continuation of those series.  And when you throw a game changer like the Wii Sports games, it's like icing on the cake.\n\nI'll never regret getting a Wii.  For someone who didn't game much between about halfway through the N64 years to a couple of years into the Wii lifecycle, it has, in the end, provided me with hours of fun.", "summary": "Provided Hours of Fun", "unixReviewTime": 1334620800}

The battery kit cost less than most of the charger docks as I only paid about $11 here on Amazon.

The game creator apparently found it too difficult to artistically conceal all of the various objects, so he/she resorted to making some of them so tiny that the gamer would need a magnifying glass to actually identify those objects. That shows a lack of talent as a game creator. The objects should be 'hidden' not just reduced to a size that makes them almost invisible. The talent lies in the imaginative way that the objects are blended into their environment.\n\nI got tired of this game is a very short time.

Good graphics. Amazingly good commentary that is better than some of the announcers that you will hear on the radio for real baseball games.

I didn't know what to make of this game upon seeing the promo back when it came out on PS3. However, after acquiring a PS4 and hearing all the exceptional word of mouth, I decided to give it a shot. Saying I'm glad I did is a severe understatement!\n\nThis is by the far the best looking game I have played. It feels like the characters really do exist, along with the insane world they live in. Even when it switches from cutscene to gameplay, there is no apparent downgrade in quality. Not an easy feat to pull off! Hopefully we are looking at the future of game titles in this aspect. Then, they won't be afraid to show us more of the gameplay in the trailers, as opposed to a split-second glimpse.\n\nThe controls are quite numerous but not overly difficult to master. By the time the 1/2 hour mark came, I was switching between upgrading to moving around to switching weapons smoothly. The tutorial in the beginning really helps with this.\n\nThe gameplay itself is, well I can't think of just one word to describe how awesome it is. The actions of the characters and reactions of their foes feel like what would happen if the situations were real. That's what makes this game deserve all the praise it gets. There is no letting up on the drama and you won't know what to expect until it happens. I mean sure, a lot of the \"infected\" (I still don't get why people are so afraid of the word zombies) move in patterns but if not for this, there would have been no way to be able to complete an action sequence, due to the difficulty when you are trying to take them out. There are definitely quite a few moments that will make you want to toss your controller across the room due to this but ultimately, the desire to go at it again until you get past it outweighs your frustration.\n\nWhich brings me to my next point. When I started playing the game, I didn't want to stop. The only reason I did was because I didn't realize how much time had passed and it was 4am! Then finished the main storyline the next day. Typically, I will be more responsible with my gaming and play a game about 2-3 hours a day until the game is done in about a week or 2. That's just how engaging this game is. Be forewarned, you will want to set aside a serious block of time before playing this.\n\nIn conclusion, I just cannot praise the makers of this game enough. Mind you, I never played the PS3 version, so perhaps the remastering fixed some problems but this was my introduction to the game, so maybe I was lucky in this aspect. The overall experience was fantastic and I can't think of anything that could be construed as negative, at least from my point of view.

I love the improved design of the analogue sticks which grip the thumbs better to reduce slipping and the fact that it is play & charge so I don't have to waste money on batteries anymore.\nThe main reason I bought it at release day, thus paying full MSRP, was because of the promise of a better D-Pad. I love fighting games; and being raised on the SNES, I prefer using a D-Pad rather than a joystick. It's no mystery that the original OEM 360 D-Pad is the worst-designed piece of garbage, so I have searched for 3rd party Xbox controllers with better D-Pads and even tried a few adapters to use PS2 controllers on the 360. I had not found a satisfying solution, so I was hoping that this would be the answer. I can honestly tell you it is better than the original 360 D-Pad design, but it still doesn't match the funtionality of the PS2/PS3 D-Pad for fighting games. I found that my accuracy did improve with distinguishing down-diagonal moves from directly down and the same with up & up-diagonal. I've gone back a few times to the original 360 controller just to confirm that it's not just a mental impression brought about by preconceived expectiations; and yes, I can definitely see a improvement. This controller would've gotten 5 stars except for one thing: they made it so it can still be transformed back into the sucky design. Why, Microsoft? Do you really think there's gamers out there that really enjoy less accuracy? We are buying this controller to escape the crappy D-Pad design... and you make this one transformable back into suck? So what that translates into is that as I am busting out combos in SSFIV and throw a fire ball followed by dragon punch, the D-Pad pops back up into disk mode and breaks my combo. You cannot do special moves without this thing popping up and down! It's obnoxious!\nSo I almost went with a $200.00 XCM converter, but finally just decided to get a PS3 so I could play the exclusives as well as buy all my fighting games for that system. I will never again buy another fighting game for the 360 until the D-Pad is really, truly fixed.\nI do recommend this controller, but just not for fighting games. The D-Pad situation has not been rectified satisfactorily. But for everything else, it's great.\n\n**Update 6/2/11**\nD-Pad just broke off tonight as I was playing Soul Calibur IV. It is really too bad that MS took the cheapest route in their half-a**ed attempt to fix their crappy d-pad. Upon closer inspection after it broke off, the d-pad is obviously a cheap, thin hollow plastic shell.\nThis controller was never abused or treated roughly; just normal use playing Street Fighter IV, Soul Calibur IV, and King of Fighters. MS made poor decisions in design and production material for the d-pad. The rest of the controller is great. But I purchased it for the \"improved\" d-pad to play fighting games. Now I am once again without a decent d-pad thanks to MS's production short-cuts and weak efforts to make a decent d-pad. Changing my rating to one-star.\n\n**Update 5/4/13**\nI replaced the broken d-pad using&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/OEM-Chrome-Silver-Gray-Transforming-D-pad-for-Xbox-360-Controller-Rotating-Dpad/dp/B007J6NPM8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">OEM Chrome Silver/Gray Transforming D-pad for Xbox 360 Controller (Rotating Dpad)</a>&nbsp;and am now once-again very happy with the controller. Other than the d-pad, it is very robust and sturdy. I have restricted use to only games that require no more than light to moderate use of the d-pad.\nFor anyone interested in the best solution that I have found for playing retro/ 2D style games on the 360; I got a couple of the Sega Saturn PS2 controllers off of Yahoo Japan auctions and PS2->360 adapters and they work perfectly.", "summary": "A great controller as long as you don't use the d-pad for fighting games", "unixReviewTime": 1300752000}

The graphics are also really nice which Nintendo very rarely gets an opportunity to be complimented on.\n\nThe dynamics of the Grand Prix have been changed a lot from Mariokart Wii which I am sure people will argue what is better or worse. Blue turtle shells are way more rare, with there maybe being one sent per race whereas in Mariokart Wii I felt like i had to fend off like 3 per race if I sat in the lead. This game also has an \"escape velocity\" for the racers in places 1-3 where they really separate from the pack and have their own go at it. The worst places to be in the game is the dreaded slots 4-9 with it being an absolute aggravating mess which can be very very difficult to escape. These dynamics are a break from Mariokart Wii where almost anyone was still in the race up until the last lap, whereas in Mariokart 8 that is no longer the case.

I did enjoy Oblivion, so I thought I'd share my thoughts on Fallout 3 GOTY after playing it on the Xbox 360.\n\nThe GOTY comes with several expansion packs. Operation Anchorage is worth playing because it gives you a special Winterized T-51b power armor and helmet that never needs to be repaired (and it is about the most powerful armor in the game), along with a Gauss Rifle that wears out but can't be repaired to 100% since there doesn't seem to be any other Gauss Rifles in the game. However, that is where Mothership Zeta comes into play. There is plenty of Alien Epoxy throughout the ship which can be used to repair the Gauss Rifle if you like that weapon.  The Pitt and Point Lookout weren't that great and quite frankly I thought they were a waste of time. Some of the perks are worth earning from the expansion packs. Broken Steel is essentially a continuation of the original story, with a level cap of 30 and new perks.\n\nThere are several features of this game that stand out. The stats are sectioned and can be confusing at first. The SPECIAL attributes are important. Intelligence and Strength are very important at first, followed by Perception and Endurance. Don't max out any of these to 10, but try to stay above 6-7. Skills are modified after each level increase, make sure you get the Swift Learner perks (3 ranks available) to get a max of 23 skill points each time you level up.  Perks are available after each level increase and give you special bonuses.\n\nBobbleheads are available to boost your SPECIAL stats and skills, so it is important to not max out your SPECIAL stats or skills early. Skill books are also available to increase your skills, so get the Comprehension perk early on.\n\nThe game was extremely frustrating at first, until I got to about level 7. Then with some strategy, it was easier to survive and somewhat fun. At level 15, my character was able to kill enemies with ease. At level 20, my character is an absolute machine. I can lay waste to enemies with the greatest of ease, and my perks from the expansion packs almost makes him impervious to radiation poisoning and damage. The unique weapons are the items that you should try to find and use. They are special variants of common weapons with more damage, but can be repaired using the common weapons. The A3-21 Plasma Rifle, Xualon Assault Rifle, and Vengeance are just a few of these examples.\n\nThis game is very very time consuming. There are a lot of mini quests to complete, and a lot of things to do. Most of the time is spent going from location to location, exploring, and role-playing game activities in general.

Bednar", "reviewText": "Finished playing this new \"Walking Dead\" game twice and now on my 3rd attempt. Ordered this game through Amazon and it was delivered rather quickly, especially since there was the threat of a winter storm heading my way. Amazon kept me updated on any changes made in release date, deliver time due to storms, and price.\n\nAnyway, this version of the \"Walking Dead\" is LIGHT YEARS ahead of that other game by the same name - you know the one I'm talking about that just about everyone rated 5 stars but somehow this games gets quite a few 1 stars or 2 stars. This game actually lived up to my expectations and I am very pleased with the game play. That other game S-T-U-N-K!!!\n\nYou play the role of Daryl Dixon from the TV show \"The Walking Dead\" and you are on an adventure in search of your brother, Merle, and to find an evacuation point in Atlanta, GA. Along the way, you have to search/scavenge for various items in order to survive. Some items are: food, sports drinks, various weapons, ammo, fuel, etc. Also, there are some relics/artifacts that you need to find in order to open up various strengths/weapons if you so decide to play the game numerous times. You also pick up survivors and can send them out on missions in search of survival gear. You need to also have a vehicle large enough to carry all you supplies/weapons and survivors  - if vehicle not large enough you then need to choose what stays behind and what other survivor you must drop in order to continue mission. There were many times when I had to leave quite a few survivors behind for I did not have the proper sized vehicle for everyone.\n\nAfter reading numerous other reviews about this particular \"Walking Dead\" game, got to agree with some that said that the graphics are not the highest in quality (better than that other game), the zombies are a bit too cartoonish (more believable than that other game), people get tired of searching the same looking structures (at least you know where all the \"goodies\" are hidden for they are always in the same spots), and a bunch of other things. Anyone else ever notice that some of the zombies in this game ACTUALLY look like some of the characters from the TV show????? Or is that just me???? Probably just me.\n\nRead some reviews where people were a bit disappointed about when you sneak up on a zombie with some type of a weapon in their hands in order to kill said zombie, that they get frustrated that the game automatically reverts to Daryl's knife for the kill. I, too, thought that that was a bit silly but quickly realized why - if you are bashing the head of a zombie with a lead pipe, baseball bat, hammer, or something else THERE IS ACTUALLY A LOUD ENOUGH NOISE MADE THAT ACTUALLY ATTRACTS OTHER ZOMBIES!!!!!!!! Found that out the hard way. I, too, like to sneak up on a zombie and bashed their head in with my trusty baseball bat (my favorite) but it sounds like you are smacking a watermelon when you hit the zombies head. Other zombies nearby hear that and come a charging. Once you open up the relic that gives you the crossbow at the very beginning of the game, the problem of sneaking up on zombies will be remedied. Yep - the crossbow is the best weapon of all, so is the silenced rifle and pistol but ammo for those weapons are scarce.\n\nI like how when you re-start the game, you have the option of choosing alternate routes that you ignored the first time and meet new survivors. Fighting in the sawmill, the hospital, and the chemical lab were about the most brutal levels of the game. However, that final mission will kick your butt - 1st time I played the final mission it took me about 5 actual hours to figure out and suffered numerous deaths. Suggest you find some grenades for this level for they will help immeasurably. Now, can somewhat quickly make it through. I also like how you are able to chop the heads or limbs off of the zombies with certain bladed weapons - took me a while to figure that out. Now I am able to send heads flying through the air in glee (but sometimes do get too excited and do forget about that zombie coming up behind me).\n\nA few things that I found annoying/do not like about this game: When you shoot a crossbow bolt and it goes just beyond reach of the playing field (i.e. - crossbow bolt is just beyond a fence and you can see it but are unable to retrieve it). Another thing that I thought annoying is when I go through a room; totally clear the room of potential zombies; thoroughly search the room; close every door possible; and still do a thorough search, there suddenly is a \"mysterious\" zombie standing right next to my character!!!! How did it get there and where did it come from!!!! That baffles me!! The zombie patrols are a bit of a nuisance for, when I'm trying to sneak up on one they always seem to be able to turn on me just in time to face me (not always though). The grappling is a bit troublesome especially when there are 5 or 6 zombies standing in line patiently waiting their turn to chomp on me - thought that rotating circle was a bit annoying until I remembered that similar non-sense you got to go through in \"Dead Island\". Also thought that the zombies \"hearing\" is quite ultra-sensitive to gunfire - if you plan to fire a weapon, be prepared to run for every zombie in the area is coming after you!!\n\nI have a bad habit of trying to slaughter as many zombies as possible - being stealthy actually does work in most instances. Trying to be stealthy when there are 30+ zombies in the area is not going to work very well - learned that the hard way numerous times. My natural instinct is to eliminate as many zombies as possible so that my escape routes are open. Had to quickly learn the value of stealth and ignore chasing after zombies.\n\nAll in all, I thought that this game was very good. Yeah, some minor nit-picky issues; graphics not as awesome that everyone wants; re-play value is definitely there for you can go back and explore ignored areas. The game was what I was hoping for (unlike that \"other\" game). Only reason I gave this game 4 stars was because I am unable to give 3.5 stars - do think that this game is above 3 stars but below 4 stars. Again, Amazon done a great job getting this game to me in a timely manner!!!!!!!!!!!!", "summary": "WAAAYYYY better than that \"other\" game of the same title!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1364515200}

Battlefield 3 drops the Bad Company name and picks up off the original name. It has nothing to do with BF2 or that line in the series, but keeps the Bad Company multiplayer, so it mixes it up a bit. BF3's single player mode gives you a taste of the new graphics engine, Frostbite 2, as well as a chance to test out some guns. The story is actually interesting with a couple of plot twists but nothing sophisticated. You jump around different people trying to find a portable nuke that was stolen. You go from the Middle East, to Russia, to a few other parts of the world, and BF3 tries throwing a few new things out there.\n\nThe characters are good and the voice acting is great, but you won't get much out of a military single player campaign. The campaign nails the atmosphere with lots of explosions, the excellent Battlefield ambiance is back and sounds more realistic than ever thanks to the new engine. The campaign does lack the scripted cinematic set pieces we grow to enjoy in these types of games. There are a few such as the earthquake in Iraq, the beginning train scene, and the jet scene in the middle of the game, but the rest is just running a gunning through open terrain and buildings. The pacing is good, but I wanted more action and some more scripted sets to make the campaign feel more punchy. BF3 does add some detail that other military shooters haven't done such as great animations. One scene has a Russian jet shooting your squad down. Running from cover to cover and ducking shows your character sliding into cover and falling down like you actually would if you dived. Getting up is just as great to look at because you stumble out of being prone so it feels so real and awesome.\n\nThe graphics are probably some of the best ever seen so far. Being on the PC the game is DirectX11 only so you get just some amazing lighting, excellent looking textures, and the most realistic water I have ever seen. The lights and coronas off the sun and flashlights blind you, everything reflects like it would in real life. Plus the sound is amazing and is actually useful in multiplayer because distance makes a difference in sound here. Gun fire sounds different at different ranges rather than just quieter. Bullets whip and whizz past you with realistic sounds, gun fire sounds incredible and the explosions look too real. The game does require a seriously (like within the last year) powerful rig to run because there's no DirectX9 option here.\n\nWhile the graphics are really the only major thing going for the campaign it is nice to play and has some replay value just to look at everything alone. The difficulty is all over the place and some spots are just extremely tough and you can die very quickly in this game. This isn't a run and gun arcade shooter like Modern Warfare or other military shooters. My only other complaint is that the game doesn't recognize gamepads very well even the Xbox 360 controller which most games have built-in standard. I did notice the mouse and keyboard felt better because it seems the game was built around these controls.\n\nThe multiplayer is where the money's at and BF3 delivers with new modes and some great maps. Using EA's Origin client you get a browser-based experience with filters and all the greatness of using a PC. The new mode is deathmatch which is greatly welcomed and back are Rush and Conquest. This time you get to play on large maps which can hold 64 players and it really does feel like a battlefield. The new maps are great and deathmatch is addictive, but DICE refined the unlock system. You don't get perks, but you do get to add things to your loadout like infinite sprint, defibrillators, medpacks etc. It does take a long time to start unlocking good stuff and you're stuck with crappy loadouts. Weapons have no scopes (except the sniper rifle), plus you only get one main weapon per class to start with. Be patient and wait to unlock scopes for rifles, stick to close range combat and just tough it out.\n\nUsing vehicles is back, and standard, on Rush and Conquest, and while these remain the same, they never get old. The new engine helps make the online fights feel bigger and badder with the sound coming into play, plus shooting down boats and helicopters with 4 guys in a tank never gets old. I didn't find any stability issues and EA is constantly updating Origin and the browser experience for online play so just stick with it and enjoy them. Battlefield 3 may not deliver a riveting single player, but the new engine, and excellent multiplayer will keep you hooked. You can also jump in for a co-op campaign ride, but you will come back for the multiplayer thanks to the, slow, yet steady unlocks which make you feel like you truly earned them.", "summary": "Excellent sequel with a gorgeous graphics engine", "unixReviewTime": 1332892800}

I just do. It may be a certain trait that just plays right into an interest of mine, or an original concept that I particularly jive on. But sometimes, even that's not the case. There's no fathomable reason why I should love this thing as much as I do, yet I go and sing its praises to anybody who will listen. And so, I can't really explain why I love \"Tomodachi Life\" as much as I do. But I suspect the ability to make anime icon Lupin III and Hillary Clinton get hitched, or have Hank Hill and Sadako of \"The Ring\" infamy be best buddies might have something to do with it.\n\n\"Tomodachi Life\" has absolutely no plot, and to an extent, absolutely no point whatsoever. You might think of it as \"The Sims,\" but played with Miis and done in the style of a particularly abstract Andy Kaufman gag. You either import Miis from your 3DS, create your own in-game, scan them in, or use a friend's, then put them on an island that you name. Oh, yes, that's after you customize their voice and personality. After that, you set them loose to interact with each other, solving their crises, aiding their relationships, and occasionally taking a peek into their dreams. Which sometimes involve them in humorous \"Sailor Moon\" fantasies. Or dancing and chanting in a very cult-like fashion around a miscellaneous household item. Yep.\n\nHonestly, there isn't much in the way of real, engaging gameplay, but to me, that's what makes it such a fresh experience. There are no convoluted menus. No annoying menial tasks that might take 20 minutes at a time to do. Nothing like that. \"Tomodachi Life\" is, to an extent, a life simulator for people who hate life simulators. Everything is handled with a few clicks of the touch screen, and you can either play for five minutes at a time or fifty minutes at a time. Yes, sometimes, things will repeat. A Mii will have the same dream, or a line of dialogue will be uttered twice. But having been played at a very dedicated rate for over two weeks now, I can wholeheartedly say that I am seeing new and unique things everyday still. To top it off, my partner has the game as well, and her experience has been almost entirely different from my own. To me, that speaks volumes to the quality of the game. No one copy will progress or act in the exact same way, which is more than I can say for Nintendo's other major life simulator, \"Animal Crossing,\" despite being a very big fan of that as well.\n\nBut what do you do outside of creating Miis and paying attention to their needs? You'll definitely be shopping for them, whether it be hats, clothes, outlandish costumes, food, or new decorations for their rooms, which contribute to their RPG-like \"Happiness Level.\" Outside of that, you can check in on them in a restaurant, send them on an 8-bit role-playing quest, watch two lovebirds chase each other down the beach, or peek in on an outdoor barbecue party. My personal favorite side-activity, and one which can certainly become a time sink if you let it, is at the concert hall. Choosing from a nice variety of musical choices, you can make Miis sing as a solo act, a duo, or a group. Best part is? You get to write the lyrics to any song and hear them sing it. They can be silly, funny, or (if you work around the censored words list, which is pretty easy) a veritable cornucopia of nonsensical raunch. This is just one of the many activities in \"Tomodachi Life\" that may seem like a silly diversion, but can quite easily keep you engaged for far longer than it should.\n\nThat's something that could be said for the entire experience, though. \"Tomodachi Life\" might not be the most in-depth, realistic life simulator out there, but I don't think it's trying to be. If \"The Sims\" is the most painstaking, and \"Animal Crossing\" the lighthearted equivalent, then this is the out-of-left-field, completely off-the-rails festival of unmitigated silliness that people who just want a good laugh play. It's fun by yourself, and it's fun playing side-by-side with a friend, trading Miis and watching them interact with each other's islanders. There's no huge commitment, and you can play it every day, or quit for a month then come back to it. Honestly, this is the type of life simulator I've been waiting for, and it's the type of bizarre, risky game that I've wanted to see Nintendo make more of. Abstract in its humor, novel in its execution, this is something that I can't help but love every second of.\n\nSo, like I said above, at the beginning of this admittedly short review, \"Tomodachi Life\" is something that I can't necessarily put into words. Simply put, it's just fun, funny, and most importantly, fresh. There's nothing else on the market quite like this. Any person of any age, I think, could have a blast with this. While I do think it would be nice if same-sex relationships were included, and that the default \"player hand\" that shows up sometimes could have its race customized (because, y'know, not everyone has pale skin,) I still think this is, all-in-all, a very wonderful and unique experience that almost anybody could have a total blast with.\n\nI mean, c'mon. Where else are you going to watch Duke Nukem become the most desired man on an island? Or watch yourself get into a committed relationship with a dreadheaded goth? Or see Danny Trejo role around on the floor in a sweatsuit out of boredom? Yeah. I rest my case.\n\nPros:\n\n- A unique idea executed well.\n- Loads of content, and most of it is fun.\n- One of the funniest games on the market.\n\nCons:\n\n- Lack of same-sex relationships sucks for those aren't straight.\n- Occasional repetition.\n\nGrade: 9 (Bomber)", "summary": "Absence of Sense, But Not of Fun", "unixReviewTime": 1403395200}

The war between the Titans and The Gods is about to begin and Kratos (you) is in the middle of it.\nThe intro, is by far, the best intro in the history of videogames. I don't want to spoil you anything, but I can tell you that, by the time you finish the intro scene, you will feel like you just want more and more!!!\nthe game is sooooo EPIC!! The boss fights don't disappoint. they are incredibly dynamic. All the Greek gods will give you a different challenge and make you change the way you fight. each boss requires you to rethink your plan of attack.\nThe gameplay in general will feel almost the same as GOW2 but refined. You have better weapons, and a great arsenal to defend yourself against the armies of the Gods.\nThe quick time events in this game feel very differently from the previous entries. Whereas in the past games the button you had to press at the quick time event appeared in the middle of the screen, now this game offers a better style. The buttons will appear on the side of the screen according to the same layout as the ps3 Dualshock controller. For example, in the controller, the button \"X' is located at the bottom. So, anytime you have to press \"X\", in the screen, you will see the button signal at the bottom of the screen. This was a change for the good, for now, everytime you are in the middle of the action fighting an enemy or boss, the action won't be interrupted by the button in  the middle of the screen like in the past games. You will enjoy this new change.\nThe graphics are gorgeous. The environments and the enemies look amazing. I specially enjoyed the design of the very first boss ------(spoiler).\nThe smaller enemies, usually won't give you much of a challenge, but sometimes these enemies will group and attack at the same time. Be careful, specially when fighting many of these and also a sub-boss for the smaller enemies will i=hold you and the sub-boss will attack you, causing good damaged to you.\nAnother good mechanic that I enjoyed was the \"block and counter\" (not sure what's the word for that..sorry) that we first found in the previous game. It feels really rewarding when you block at the last minute and blasting a devastating counter attack thanks to the golden fleece. (I personally loved to used this i n GOW2).\nThe story of revenge of Kratos is a good story..kinda. But still makes the game enjoyable. You will feel Krato detemination like never before. At one point in the game, Kratos will meet a special person to which he actually bonds. And you can feel the bond very natural. This will show you that Kratos is not just a killing machine..and remind you that once, he was actually a family man.\nThe soundtrack of the game does not disappoint. It couldn't have been better. Is epic and will inspire you to keep kicking some godly a$$e$. The great variation that the composers, Gerard Marino, Jeff Rona, Mike Reagan, Ron Fish and Cris Velasco provide is b y far their best job. My personal favorite is the song that plays at the final fight called \"Brothers of Blood\".\nThe game is the best in the saga. i wish this game would have been the last, it would have been the perfect closing for this epic saga. But unfortunately, Sony Santa Monica though it would be a great idea to make yet another GOW game..the \"Ascension\" one...which is not, by any means, bad..but just saying this game was perfect for closing the saga. You can read my review of the other game in my channel/profile.\nAll in all, don't miss this game. You will regret it.

What the game lacked in polish, it made up for in a storyline that I really enjoyed.\n\nFast forward to the Force Unleashed II. Most of the control issues have been fixed. A lot of the graphical hiccups have been adjusted as well. The game looks and plays very well, but not great - no wear near the level of a game like God of War III. The force powers have been upgraded, dual lightsabers look great and sith fury is just awesome. The targeting system has been vastly upgraded, so there is less blasting plants or walls when you are trying to hit an enemy. At the same time, you still get trapped in your animations and can be carried away from enemies or off of ledges. Even with those gripes, there is far more polish here than on the original.\n\nUnfortunately, the story is sadly lacking. Where I was compelled to see what happened, excited to see familiar faces and square off with The Emperor; here it was just kind of...meh.\n\nMany of the reviews claim the game can be completed in 5-6 hours. That is true, on easy, not completing many of the \"tasks\" to fully complete the game. That said; if you're not into trophy collections and collecting various items for your costume, combos, etc., Force Unleashed II is probably a rental.

The main story was pretty short, and despite all the hooplah about important choices effecting the outcome they really didn't. Other than a few dialogue changes. One thing that seemed better though was that it felt like they finally put a cap on the infinite re-spawning enemies. While the story and voice acting are definitely good there are still some very tongue in cheek kind of moments. (Spoilers!) Like charging a double barreled tank on horseback??? really? Another bit that left much to be desired were the side missions with the main story.

With the most frustrating return being bad maps. All maps feel claustrophobic which really effects the overall game play. Instead of using teamwork and strategy to win the day, your reduced to camping or running around constantly only to hope that you come across someone while their backs are turned. The weapons load-out though has some nice new touches. Such as the ability to use more perks or add more attachments to your weapons. With that the leveling is pretty much the same as it was in Black Ops I. As you level higher you unlock more camo, weapons, care packages and so on.

That said, I was happy when Nintendo released their designs for the Wii Zapper, however, something bothered me.  The trigger was in the front while the grip was in the back.  This goes against most firearm setups as most target shooters place the grips in the front while the trigger is in the back.  This way, it feels more natural using your dominant hand as the trigger hand otherwise if you put it in reverse you either are forced to use your non-dominant hand or flip the hands around and are forced to keep the firearm pressed against your chest to keep your eyes down the sights.  The latter is an extreme no-no for anyone who has fired an actual firearm as the butt of the rifle should go against your shoulder, NOT your chest.\n\nThat said, firearm practitioners will find the Wii Zapper extremely non-ergonomic and somewhat cumbersome.  Anyone who has not fired a rifle will not notice the difference and adapt.  It is understandable why the Wii Remote must be placed in front since the forward laser needs a clear line of sight, however, it takes away from the feel of the zapper.  I bought the Zapper and quickly purchased the Nyko Perfect Shot as it feels more natural as a sidearm than the Zapper as a rifle or carbine.\n\nThis is not to say that the Zapper is not worth getting.  Link's crossbow training is very useful at practicing your usage of a standard Wii Remote and Nunchuck as it is with the Nyko Perfect Show.  I use my Perfect Shot on Link's Crossbow Training every now and then to improve my reaction time as well as eye-hand coordination.  The game hosts several excellent exercises to maximize efficiency with any firearm-type Wii device so it is worth paying the money over.\n\nAll in all, the game makes the Zapper, not the other way around.

As far as MMO's are concerned, SWTOR has a lot of positive things going for it, and also has a lot of shortcomings.  I have been playing the game since the beta, so I have seen some of the improvements they made before release and have had an opportunity to have more time with the game than some other people may have had.\n\nPROS\n\nWhere SWTOR really shines is in the story telling (class quests).  Being a fully voiced MMO and using cutscenes, the game presentation is great.  Stories for each of the classes are interesting and compelling.  The problem is it's greatest strength is also it's greatest weakness (see cons).  Most quests are the standard run-of-the-mill, kill this many of this and grab that many of that, so it won't win any awards for original gameplay.  The atmosphere of the entire game is very Star Wars.  There is something very satisfying playing as a Jedi or Sith and hearing the whoosh and buzz of a wielded light saber.  Combat feels more viseral than other MMOs I've played.  There are a wider range of player animations than typically seen in an MMO and the effects look good.  Sound design is also great and the orchestral scores are epic.  Planets like Tatooine and Hoth really make you feel like you have entered the Star Wars universe.  The game employs 4-player flashpoints that give players a chance to go thru a longer, dungeon type mini story that require players fulfilling various roles to complete objectives to get better loot (the old tank, dps, healer formula).  If the game was a single player RPG or even a local coop game this would all be great but when a game is advertised as an MMO people have certain expectations, well this is where the game falls short.  Another interesting mechanic to the game is that you get your own crew and a starship.  As your class storyline progresses, you will be introduced to NPCs that will become your companions.  These companions actually gather the mats for your crafting and do the crafting of your items.  You also get to take one companion with you everywhere you go.  Each companion has their own class so you can choose to take your healer, tank , or dps companion along with you on quests.  There are also rail style starship missions that act as a welcome diversion from the normal MMO grind.  These type of innovations are headed down the right path and have the potential to set the game apart from it's competitors.  As part of the competitive multiplayer aspects of the game, there are three warzones that players can participate in which are variants of capture the flag and capturing and holding certain areas on a map.  Being someone who enjoys all types of games and gameplay, I am content in playing the game and can keep myself occupied by playing every aspect of the game to it's fullest.  However, if you are the type of player that only likes to do 'battlegrounds' or questing, etc. and focuses only on one aspect of the game, there may not be enough content to keep you engaged for very long.\n\nCONS\n\nBeing a story driven MMO forces the game to be fairly linear, this hurts grouping and reduces the feeling of having an open world to explore as you wish.  While having a variety of planets to visit, each planet is geared towards a particular level range so once played there is no reason to return and revisit a planet.  Also, there seems to be very little variation in the climate or terrain of each planet so each planet can be quickly reduced to the flat desert planet or fissure ridden ice planet if you get my drift.  And the part that falls flat and will disappoint hardcore MMO fans...end of game content.  End game content is lacking.  Leveling is fairly easy and quick in the game so unless you plan on playing the game to experience all the various storylines of the different classes you will probably get bored pretty quick. Armor models for high level gear are absolutely awful.  Being an artist myself I wonder who got the job of designing the clothing in this game.  You'll find yourself reaching to get the better gear for the stats only, not because the better gear actually also looks cooler. Despite the novel approach to crafting, there are not enough schematics or compelling schematics to engage you in the crafting process.  Most gear you can make for your level is lower quality than you can find.\n\nI could go on much longer about the pros and cons of this game, but then I would never finish this review.\n\nIn summary, SWTOR has advanced the MMO genre in it's presentation and the addition of a strong story telling element, however, the implementation of these aspects caused some of the traditional aspects of MMOs to suffer.  I think the game has a lot of potential, but it will be interesting to see how Bioware and EA handle the MMO in the upcoming months to see if they can tweak the formula and evolve the game to the point where things begin to mesh better.  I am enjoying the game at the moment myself but hardcore MMO fans may get bored with this one quickly.  If I reviewed this game after only playing a character to level 30 or so I probably would have given it 5 stars, but it's clear that the crafting system and end game content are too weak to sustain most people's attention on a long term basis.  I think it's a game worth experiencing, but the decision is whether to give it a go now, or wait until they add more end game content and hopefully tweak the crafting system.", "summary": "A great game, BUT...", "unixReviewTime": 1330128000}

The other downside is that if you play online make sure you got a great connection or expect more lag. Also multiplayer you start out a weak boxer so you have to either by packs to make your character stronger or practice non stop. Now only question I have for gamers is how do you watch your instant replays on the ea website cause I was unable to find it after uploading my instant replays. Plus for the pure fans they have all the legends and super stars who  have their own unique style.

You should not always focus fire on the first ship. Thinking that this is always the proper thing to do would give one the impression that the game has thrown you into unwinnable circumstances by the time you get to the second system. All ships in the fleet contribute to overall performance including evasion. If you can hardly land any hits on the big tough ship in front, focus on any disposable peons behind it first. Then it will typically be much easier to deal with. Most early battles are all about dodging, waiting for the enemy to fire a barrage rather than a normal shot and then following up with your own and backing off until you can get dodge back up.\n\nAnyway, I'll kick the review off with what I didn't like: Space battles are ugly. I mean real ugly. They should have gone with 2D here rather than opt for polygons since battles are quite literally one dimensional anyway. You still get that Front Mission sense of satisfaction watching your attacks initiate and seeing them smack into the enemy but focusing on 2D with a pleasing aesthetic rather than 3D on the DS would have made for a much more satisfying experience I think. Especially since the game is technically one-dimensional.\n\nYes, 1D. The only thing that you really control spatially is the distance between two fleets composed of up to 5 capital ships each (if you have the speed advantage). The 1D factor is actually not really a negative. It really doesn't need to be more complicated since much of the game is prep and strategy anyway. Tactics are more about when to come out of your dodge status to open fire and at what range so far (I'm not up to fighters or the need to really kill off the other guy's crew yet).\n\nLike most ginoromous galaxy games, planets are by and large not very interesting outside of the conversations to be had at the bar and the inventory at any shops that may or may not be present. Some planets are completely pointless beyond being a place to rest your crew and repair all damage. It's more of a system-to-system game than planet-to-planet game.\n\nI'm about 10 hours in and the story shows promise, but the itch that this game really scratches for me is the slow build to ultimate power factor. I compare it to Suikoden not just because there are 100 characters you can find (who all contribute to your fleet of up to five capital ships in various ways but also because the fleet itself is much like the castle that slowly grows and evolves in Suikoden only minus all the store conveniences and Iron Chef-style competitions.\n\nIt's like Front Mission in the sense that the battles are a fairly similar although typically less complex experience and you really spend a lot of time tweaking and configuring the ships in your fleet. You actually build out the interior with modules that serve both strategic and tactical roles and weapons, fighters and boarding actions are all possibilities.\n\nI pretty much bought this one just looking at the box. I got the sense that it wasn't a real high-budget experience but that I was going to dig the strategy/build-your-own-fleet factor of it and I wasn't disappointed.", "summary": "Suikoden + Front Mission + Crappy Visuals (not that hard - see review)", "unixReviewTime": 1274227200}

Combat is quick, chaotic, and responsive with a lot of room for customization based on personal preference. Multiple strategies work and you must constantly change your approach based on the situation at hand, which keeps things interesting throughout. Outside of combat, exploration of the world is deeply satisfying as numerous secrets exist and the environment is vivid and brilliantly realized. In short, it is a pleasure to see all that it offers and does not feel like a resource-collection grind (which is really what it is).\n\nThe story, while convoluted, is steeped in history, science, and fantasy. The merging of real events and social issues with advanced yet retro steampunk technologies and fanatical religion combine to create an alternate reality (in fact, an infinite number of them) that challenges the player intellectually. The way the story is told, through character interactions, voxophones (audio recordings), kinetoscopes (short movies), flashbacks (and forwards, sideways) feels novel when taken together, although these individual elements are used countless times in other games. The main characters are developed with real emotions and actions that reflect them. Nothing I can think of feels cheap with the sole purpose of driving things in a certain direction dictated by the development team.\n\nSo, given these glowing recommendations where are my reservations?\n\nThe enemies, while varied, are for the most part not particularly ominous. The vast majority of them are men (and women) just like you. Unlike the twisted inhabitants of Rapture with their mutant powers and mutated forms, the foes you face in Columbia are not really scary. The threat is more from their sheer numbers than anything else. A few exceptions exist, and there are a few startling moments, such as in the warden's office, but I felt a distinct lack of dread for most encounters, which was not true for the earlier games.\n\nAnother (more significant) gripe for me is the main resource itself, which is money (Silver Eagles). This is vastly different, and less satisfying, than the resource system in prior games. Gone are little sisters and the choices you must make to harvest or save them for precious ADAM. Even worse, ADAM harvesting from a corpse is also gone. These provided some of the most memorable moments--protecting your little sister from enemies flocking from all directions while she painstakingly harvests ADAM from the corpse.\n\nAnd this leads to my last issue--you have little choice in this game. Whereas in prior games, the choices you make throughout the game directly influence its conclusion; in Bioshock Infinite, everything is leading towards an inevitable conclusion. In fact, all of the major choices have already been made OUTSIDE OF THE ACTION OF THE GAME.\n\nSo, taken on its own, this is a great game. When compared to its predecessors, which is only natural given the fact that this is a series, I felt that a few things I wanted were missing.\n\nStill, this game is worth your time and monetary investment. It's clear from the moment it starts that this game was a labor of love and a lot of hard work and creativity went into it.", "summary": "Excellent game play, great story telling, but...", "unixReviewTime": 1364860800}

First, the story mode is really short--as you can see from my previous statement it took me only one sitting on the second to hardest difficulty.  I love how there is tons of moves and force upgrades and powers you can use/earn/purchase but you don't even need all of them and you don't even need most of them.  I was able to get through the game with just the lightsaber and lightning pretty much the only reason i used or grabbed the rest of the abilities was just so i could knock out the xbox 360 achievements!  in my opinion this game does have some easy achievements, but if you want the 1000/1000 gamerscore for it i can see you spending a little more time because the hardest difficulty, which i've only tried for a few minutes is pretty hard.  i wish there was a create a character feature on here, but i know it wouldn't tie into or help out the storyline but the graphics were good but weren't what i expected either.  i would rent this game instead of buying just because it was so short.", "summary": "Star Wars Force of July", "unixReviewTime": 1246752000}

The Vita is a great value for the hardware you get, but it comes with a meager 4 GB chip.  A single AAA game download will fill that card up, meaning it's good for little more than save data for your hard-copy games and some small odds and ends.  Considering how crucial wireless downloads are to modern systems, especially handhelds, this just doesn't work.  And so you spend at least $100 on more memory, which eliminates any value the Vita price held.  Those who carry Sony's water will attempt to justify this as a necessary counter to the money lost on hardware sales, but hardware has lost money in this business for decades.  It's the software that is supposed to recoup the lost money, not crucial components that are left out of the box.\n\nHowever, PlayStation Plus has eased this issue somewhat.  It's a $50 a year price tag, so there's more dough spent, but it's a very solid service that offers a number of cheap or even free games for download.  And many of these are AAA quality titles, including Uncharted, Little Big Planet, Disgaea 3, and so on.  There are some negatives to Plus, which don't really belong in this review, but an overpriced memory card becomes a decent value if you're scoring $100-$300 worth of quality downloads every year.  You could theoretically sign on to Plus and never pay for a single game directly, and always have something good to play.  Traditionalists are undoubtedly tearing their hair out at this idea, since you'll never \"own\" any of these titles, but for most gamers who play-and-discard, it would be a great money-saving strategy.  Obviously, this requires faith that Sony will keep making good games available for free to Plus members, so buyer beware.\n\nIn short: if you play the angles right, you can justify the absurd prices of these memory cards.  (Comparable products can be found for other devices in the $20-$30 range.)  Otherwise, you'll have to swallow your pride.  $250 for a Vita?  It's $350, at least, and maybe more if you're a pack rat.

The game is almost too much for me as I guess I am just not too much of a tennis nut or maybe it is that I am just not coordinated enough for it:) LOL either way, this game sure does deliver! And if you are not much of a tennis player, such as myself, then you can expect a serious learning curve. All in all I would have to say that this game delivers and in a BIG way!\n\nDo you love tennis, do you own a PS3? If you answered yes to those,then you NEED this game!

You know that there are the fanboys who ordered it ten years ago, and you know there are the haters who insistently say that it is going to be terrible. Personally, after Ghosts, I was one of the haters. I thought that this game would be just like the others again, just FURTHER IN THE FUTURE, which nobody wanted. I changed my mind a couple of weeks ago after seeing the multiplayer reveal. Sure, this isn't the revolutionary game which is so bold, that everyone has to have it. This game is different. It is different from previous Call of Duty's, and it is different from any game you have ever played.\nWhat makes it unique?\nYou may be thinking a lot of talk, and no walk. Well, the only place i'm walking to with this game is my couch. Advanced warfare is a bold step in the right direction. Whether it is the new movements presented with the exo skeleton in multiplayer, or the new HUI. Advanced Warfare blends in the new and shiny into smooth movements, almost as if you have been playing with the exo skeleton for a few years.\nWhy only 4 stars?\nI don't believe any game is perfect, and there are still a lot of doubts in my head with Advanced Warfare. I think that four starts suits this game well.\nI am one person who will say that Black Ops 2 is the best Call of Duty to be made, and everyone has their own opinion. It is hard to tell, only having played this for an hour or two, whether this game will be right up there. I definitely see the potential in it, and am looking forward to playing it for the next year until the NEW one comes out. This is how the system works, but I am convinced this year is going to be fun.\nIf you are still on edge about it, I will be uploading some gameplays to my Youtube channel.

(Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev)", "reviewText": "It does not go without saying that Super Mario Galaxy was a huge breakthrough for the Nintendo Wii seven years ago (Yes. It's that long ago now!). Despite that, it was as equally surprising to see a sequel come aboard three years later. For the first time ever, there's a direct sequel to a 3D Mario game on the same console. Considering how much of an event each game in the series was, this was an unexpected treat! Fast-forward to the day I got the game, it did not disappoint!\n\nAdmittedly, there were a couple things that I found concerning. The game starts off with this storybook-like opening. In it, Mario goes through this little 2D level, and on the way through, he comes across the silver Luma that grants him his spin-attack and other Lumas that tell Mario they can be used as Sling Stars to fling Mario across the sky. The problems I have with this is that it doesn't bring in the same engaging tone the first game had, and it also plays out everything as if the first game never happened. This further goes on when other returning characters from Galaxy 1 meet each other \"for the first time\" (and Rosalina, arguably the most important character in the first game, is gone here). It bothers me considering this is supposed to be a SEQUEL. Heck, even on the Wii Menu, Mario shouts \"Super Mario..GALAXY!\" completely dismissing the \"2\". And this isn't even a recycled voice clip! This was re-recorded for this SEQUEL. What's going on here?\n\nLabels aside, Super Mario Galaxy 2 is jam-packed with creativity just like its predecessor! If you've played the original, you'll be able to dive right in, because the game functions almost identically to before. You use the Wii Remote and Nunchuck to have Mario move around gorgeous environments as he runs, jumps, swings his fists, and RIDES YOSHI! Yep! Yoshi joins in on the fun this time around in some levels, and he's not the only sidekick; Luigi is back and ready to kick some! You don't even need to collect 120 Stars to unlock him! No matter which brother you play as, though, there's plenty to adore and explore.\n\nThere are fewer Stars to collect in each galaxy you come across, but that actually gets balanced out by the slightly more galaxies there are in total. And boy are these galaxies FUN! Longtime Mario fans can already expect to fall in love with the imaginative designs these worlds are composed of, but the overall result is positively exhilarating for everybody. There are levels of all shapes and sizes, with casts of themes and enemies, as well as loads of stuff Mario can do to move on. There are galaxies where everything is giant, where Mario guides Chain Chomps moving along flip panels, where Mario can dig through the ground, where evil clones chase him, where Yoshi is used to dash as quickly as Sonic, and the list goes on. This is just a small fraction of what the game has to offer!\n\nHeck, even when you beat the game, there's still a lot of content left over for you to finish during a post-game journey. Hidden Stars are everywhere, and there is even a gauntlet of levels that will likely put your skills to the test. I'm not going to go too deep into this subject, but let's just say that the game manages to squeeze in a whopping 242 Stars to collect in total, and that can only take place after beating the game once!\n\nAnyway, what exactly will Mario be equipped with as he sprints along planets joyfully? Well, along with some levels containing Yoshi, there will be a number of power-ups Mario can use to help add some spice to the adventure. Some of the power-ups return from the original Mario Galaxy, such as the Bee Mushroom, which gives Mario a silly bee costume and allows him to buzz in the air, the Boo Mushroom, turning Mario into a ghost, and the Spring Mushroom, which has Mario bounce as a spring. This time around, though, we also get the Cloud Flower, which allows Mario to seriously create his own cloud platforms, and a Rock Mushroom that turns him into a boulder. Yoshi also gets a few powers of his own, causing him to run, float like a balloon, and glow like a light bulb.\n\nWhile we're on the topic of assistance, does anybody remember the 2-Player mode in the original Galaxy? That thing was a joke. That was really my only real problem with the game, but it irks me nevertheless. Mario Galaxy 2 brought the mode back, but this time, it's kinda more fleshed out. Probably not by much to justify it as an amazing feat, but it's still worthy to note that there have only been improvements. The second player now has a Luma character, and can not only stun enemies and pick up Star Bits lying around, but he/she can also pick up coins and mushrooms, kill enemies, flip switches, and activate checkpoints.\n\nLike the game before it, Super Mario Galaxy 2 is masterpiece, despite some quirks I couldn't help but notice. Whether or not you own the original Super Mario Galaxy, this sequel is wholeheartedly recommended. Personally, I prefer getting the first game if I had to judge, but let's be real here: There's no reason why you wouldn't buy both. They're both amazing quality platformers :P", "summary": "Party like it's 2007!", "unixReviewTime": 1409702400}

The plot unfolds more like an episode of 24 than a plodding Tom Clancy novel. Twists abound, and people aren't always who they seem to be. The plot also gives some very interesting insight into Sam Fisher's character, as the silent badass becomes more human. You really get a sense of who, and what he's fighting for, and it's a real treat toward the end-game when his philosophies on revenge, duty, and trust really come to the surface.\n\nThe campaign is short - five hours short - but it's very fun, and even finds some strength in it's brevity. After a brief introductory sequence in Malta, Sam spends the rest of his time lurking around Washington, D.C., visiting various locations to unravel a treasonous conspiracy.\n\nPerhaps \"lurking\" isn't the right word, though. Stealth elements in Conviction have been stripped down to the essentials, crouching in shadows, and watching enemy patrols for the right time. Beyond that, Splinter Cell plays more like an action game with an emphasis on keeping to the shadows. Players can swiftly take down enemies with the push of a button, and if things get out of hand, they're armed to the teeth, or if they're a bit more sneaky, they can make a quick getaway with one of the new gadgets.\n\nThankfully, even with the absence of some of the older features, Ubisoft has added in quite a few awesome new gameplay mechanics. The first, and most important is Mark and Execute. The player can pick out a number of enemies, and with the tap of a button, quickly dispatch them all, making it easy to get passed overwhelming patrols. But, it's not like it's a win button either, you have to get a melee kill to charge up your Mark and Execute meter, which pretty much perfectly balances out the new mechanic. The second notable new feature is Last Known Position. Upon being spotted, a silhouette of Sam will appear so you can tell where the guards thought you were last. This makes it easier to escape, or even set up an ambush.\n\nThere are some spots that change up the formula, and they can be quite entertaining. Chasing a conspirator around the Washington Monument, and, in a throwback to the old style of Splinter Cells, a sequence where you have to maneuver around an environment completely undetected. There are some pretty superb moments beyond that which I won't spoil, but there are some moments which don't work as well. Interrogations are brutally satisfying, but they serve to slow things down quite a bit, and are little more than slightly interactive cut-scenes.\n\nThe campaign is quite good as long as you're not expecting a lengthy adventure. The game has changed, Sam Fisher has changed, and in most part, it's for the better.\n\nA Co-Op campaign was disappointingly absent from Splinter Cell: Double Agent, a letdown indeed after its memorable debut in Chaos Theory. Co-Op is back in full force in Conviction, however, in the form of The Prologue, which might just be the best of Splinter Cell: Conviction's three main pillars of game modes.\n\nThe Prologue doesn't have as much of an emphasis on story, but it does rather well in leading up to Sam's rampage as seen in the Campaign, and the character development is actually pretty great. Archer, a Third Echelon agent, and Kestrel, a Russian agent working for Voron (an international Third Echelon equivalent) must form an alliance to track down some stolen weaponry. Oh, and there's an awesome twist ending.\n\nIn terms of the gameplay, things remain pretty much the same as in the Campaign, however, working together on coordinated strikes against guards is a lot of fun, and, as mentioned before, co-op Mark and Executes are pretty insane, allowing you to clear out quite a few guards with a little bit of team work.\n\nThe Co-Op in Conviction is tons of fun, and in my opinion, the best mode the game has to offer. The story is well told, if simple, and the gameplay really lends itself to a co-op experience.\n\nDeniable Ops is the last piece of the Conviction equation, and it doesn't totally stack up to the rest of the game's offerings. It's essentially a quick-play mode for one or two players in which an objective must be completed on one of the maps from the Prologue (as well as one additional one exclusive to Deniable Ops). There's Hunter, in which players must take down a certain number of enemies, Last Stand, where they must defend an EMP against waves of attackers, Infiltration, which requires players to take down guards without being detected, and Stand Off, Conviction's only adversarial multiplayer mode.\n\nOf these, Hunter is the only one that really works, since the core gameplay (as in guard-killing fun) holds up just fine. Last Stand and Infiltration don't work as well because they require either all-out gunplay, or total stealth respectively, which goes against the game's natural balance of the two. Stand Off is a simple spy vs. spy deathwatch, the twist being that A.I. guards litter the map. For the most part, it works pretty well, but it's nothing outstanding.\n\nWhile it's disappointing that there's no Spies vs. Mercenaries mode, Deniable Ops does the trick when it comes to quick, pick-up-and-play Splinter Cell action, just don't expect anything deep.\n\nCampaign, Prologue, and Deniable Ops are held together by PEC Challenges, which can be completed across any of the game modes. The challenges range from simply escaping from a heated situation, to more whacky stuff like killing a guard by throwing another guard at him. These challenges award points which can be used for upgrading weapons and gadgets (for use across all game modes), and uniforms (only usable in Deniable Ops). These challenges actually offer a decent incentive for replay value, and outfitting your gear quickly becomes addicting.\n\nConviction's production values aren't stellar, but they get the job done. The graphics run on the now-dated Unreal 2 engine, although it does well all things considered. Lighting effects continue to impress, and the art-style is quite good, however, close inspection of pretty much anything in the game will reveal how low-tech it is. The sound department is decent, too. Voice acting is hit or miss, with Michael Ironside's gravelly Sam Fisher being a highlight, as always. The music is quite good, and really sets the tone for sneaking, or all-out confrontations. Sound effects can get repetitive, but for the most part the game does its job in looking, and sounding fine, but there's nothing amazing here.\n\nFrom Conviction's Campaign, and Co-Op Campaign offerings, you're play time will probably clock in at around 12 hours, but Deniable Ops, and PEC Challenges can chew up a lot of time as well. The individual pieces of the package won't provide a whole lot of mileage, but combined, this game definitely has the replay value to justify a purchase.\n\nSplinter Cell: Conviction is a very hit or miss game when it comes to everything from gameplay mechanics, to production values. The game is certainly not without its flaws, but the good ultimately outweighs the bad making Conviction a game worth checking out.", "summary": "Sam Fisher's Rampage is Thoroughly Enjoyable", "unixReviewTime": 1271376000}

I played a few times in a group locally with friends and tried to play through solo a few times but some how it just never quite grabbed me.\n\nThis I decided to see what the big deal was with Diablo so I just started up a barbarian, followed along with the story, read all the dialog and tried to take it all in. In total, trying to explore a lot and experimenting with different armor buffs and level-achieved perks, it took around 20 hours to kill Diablo (my Barbarian at level 32 at the end).\n\nI did die a few times a long the way but nothing impossible. For at least one boss I just had to step back a moment, examine what was happening and re-adjust my approach.\n\nWhat I realized as I entered the final moments of the game was the default difficulty is actually an extended tutorial so you can learn your chosen character class and what style of combat works for you. In other words this game is made with the assumption it is going to played over and over and over again. Diablo III isn't made to be played through once and you're done. If that's the plan you're in for a disappointment as the default difficulty is incredibly easy and the story exists just enough to as a device to keep hacking and slashing away.\n\nHaving only played through once I'm sure the \"real\" players would say I haven't \"really\" played the game at all. But this review isn't for those players, it's for a Diablo-curious types.\n\nFor what's worth my Barbarian approach was to stun the enemies around me and try to affect them with an area-of-effect shout and spin attack to kill multiple at once. I think I killed around twenty enemies in one shot that way once or twice.\n\nAs I assume many reviewers have mentioned this game is online-only, even when you're solo. I have run into a few instances in which latency has really hit me (I have cable connection around 25Mbps down). Seems like if blizzard wants to cripple the game that way they have they should at least have such issues resolved or at least some way of smoothly adapting to it. The servers go down every so often and unlike SC2 no offline play at all. I don't mind so much (I just read a book).\n\nI have played multiplayer a few times and popping in and out is rather seamless. I haven't felt the need to play multiplayer so much because I am still learning the ins and outs of the game play and different classes.\n\nI do actually find it fun and interesting to experiment with different combinations of class skills and armor buffs/runes. And that's what the real game is: the endless quest for more, better loot. I have yet to be forced into the auction house so I can't speak to that. Personally I think I would just play my humble random drop builds in perpetuity before I'd pay in-game-gold or real money for loot necessary to keep playing. But that's just me.\n\nI still don't know if I'm going to get into the game enough to play over and over and over to get the \"bestest loot ever\". Perhaps I'll just get all my characters (with the various classes) up to level 60 (or as close to it as I can anyway) so I have some cool characters to play with online with friends. Or perhaps I'll get tired of it before that and never touch or think about it again. It could go either way.", "summary": "Review from a non-hardcore", "unixReviewTime": 1341878400}

Combining great action and continuous and immersive storytelling, Half-Life went on to win more then 50 game-of-the-year awards and was even named \"Best PC Game Ever\" by PC Gamer. Ever since fans of the original heard about Half-Life 2 they have been hoping that it lives up quality of the first game. The good news is that it does. While it is not as groundbreaking as the original, the gameplay and storytelling surpass it in just about every way.\n\nThe game begins some unknown years after the events of Half-Life when the G-Man drops you off in the European city 17. While you were gone, the combine have managed to open portals all over the planet, and successfully conquer the world, and it is up to you to lead the resistance. The storyline is told flawlessly through various one sided conversations (your character does not speak) with NPC characters. The NPCs show genuine emotion and have superb voice acting and the facial animation is nothing short of breathtaking. Many of the characters from the previous game are back such as Barney and a few new characters are introduced as well. The game does a good job of genuinely making you care about City 17 and its inhabitants.\n\nWhen you are not interacting with the games many characters, you will be engaged in fierce firefights with the many different types of combine enemies. Enemies range from small head crabs to massive striders. You have a wide range of weapons to use in your fight. Your standard pistols, submachine guns, and shotguns appear along with some more creative weapons. The gravity gun allows you to grab objects in the environment and shoot them at your foes with extreme force. From explosive barrels to a table, anything and everything is a potential weapon. Another weapon worth mentioning is the pheropods which allow you to summon and control vicious ant lions.\n\nYou will find yourself fighting in a variety of locations. You will find yourself in places like City 17, underneath a train bridge, and Ravenholm which is an abandoned mining town. Each location is visually appealing and features different gameplay.\n\nThe artificial intelligence in the game does its job pretty well and keeps the fighting fun and interesting. Unfortunately, the AI of your occasional teammates is not as good. They have a hard time hitting their targets and like to get in the way when fighting inside.\n\nThe game also includes vehicles, a buggy and an airboat, which are used during some long and extremely thrilling sequences. The vehicles are extremely fast and offer good control. Both eventually get weapons attached to them, allowing you to dispatch foes while driving around. The vehicle sequences do a great job of adding variety to the game.\n\nThe game itself is beautiful to look at. The source engine does a great job powering the game. The world looks believable and complex while characters and weapons look great. The only negative thing one could say about the graphics is that the lack of real time dynamic lighting. Realistic lighting would have gone a long way in improving the visuals.\n\nThe audio in the game is nearly perfect. The voice acting is convincing and the sound effects sound realistic. The ambient audio in the levels also sound great and convincing. The game's music is the only thing that could be improved. While its short techno riffs do kick in at appropriate times, the music often lasts too long. Also, the music isn't anything spectacular, but by no means bad.\n\nThe storyline in the game is probably its biggest disappointment. While Half-Life has an interesting storyline, a lot of it is easily missed when playing the game. While the basic storyline is easy to follow, there are a lot of small details that can be easily overlooked. Luckily there are excellent sites, like the Half-Life timeline, that can help you fill in the gaps in the story. Also, if you are one of those people that like questions answered, you may be disappointed by the ending of the game. The game ends in such a way that you will end up with more questions then you have answers.\n\nBut even still, Half-Life 2 is an excellent and compelling game. Combined with its amazing visuals and solid combat, Half-Life 2 is a game no action fan should miss.", "summary": "Worth the wait", "unixReviewTime": 1149465600}

The only significant difference is the addition of quite good graphics.\nUnfortunatly this is one of the most uninteresting games i've ever played.  I pretty much exclusivly play rpgs and i was just totally bored about 10 minutes into this game.  The plot is pretty much just meeting some schmuck on the road and he tells you something to do, so you go do it, and kill things along the way.  I mean come on...that was pretty fun at first but after Diablo, Diablo 2, and the numerous clones they spawned; that sort of thing has kind of gotten old.\nYou can only play as a human character and theres very few modifications you can do to your characters looks (and all of those modifications are abhorantly cheesy looking).\nThe advancement system is pretty simple, and i think thats why its boring.  If you want you character to be good in melee weapons; then you smash things with a sword.  Want an archer?  shoot things with a bow then.  Want character who can smash and shoot?  then smash things with a sword half of the time and shoot with a bow the other half.\nBut the thing that really made me hate this game was the camera angles.  They jammed so many stupid trees and caves and mountains into the screen that you cant see ANYTHING.  you have to spend about a minute moving your camera around before you can see anything, giving yourself an epileptic seizure in the process.  I found it easist just to play the game completly in the \"mega-map\" mode.  In that mode all the silly graphics don't get into your way and you can actually see where you're going.  But of course in the map mode you reduce the game to commanding a dot around and telling it to kill things.\nThe game did suprise me on how smoothly it ran.  Usually microsoft games give me alot of trouble with choppy graphics and game crashes.  But this one never crashed and was plesently smooth and fast.  Figures that the only game they make the runs smooth is the one i'm not interesting in playing...\nAll in all if you're up for a diablo clone i'd recommend throne of darkness, forget about this waste of 1 gigabyte.  On the up side it may make a good game for children...", "summary": "I hate, hate, hate, hate, hated this game", "unixReviewTime": 1019260800}

Bioware does a good job here with a wide range of characters with different personalities and the voice acting is almost uniformly very good. I laughed out loud at some of the exchanges between the characters in this game. The combat sequences are also a lot of fun and the player has the option of playing the combat in real time or more of turn based style through the \"tactical camera\" which is a huge plus when playing the game on a more difficult setting.\n\nMy criticisms of this game is too much time wasted collecting resources (when the player is head of a huge army / movement and should have lots of underlings to pick plants and mine ore. Wasting time finding resources makes the otherwise decent crafting system a bit tedious. The other is the weird decision on Bioware's part to lock the player character into his pajamas at the home base. Those pj's are the same for every player character no matter what race, gender, etc. and just look stupid. Lastly, there's not a ton of variety in arms and armor that can be obtained so the PC's look is relatively steady. None of these are that big a deal, but would make gameplay a lot more fun or immersive.\n\nI did not have any of the glitches or bugs encountered by others playing on a quad-core machine with an AMD 7770 graphics card. I only encountered one crash to desktop in more than two weeks of playing.

Hacker", "reviewText": "All the 1 star ratings are misleading big time, the game overall is pretty awesome even if people didn't like the ending.  To me the ending made sense given what happens at the beginning of Mass Effect 2 so I thought the ending was fitting and a good way to end the game.  It's kind of sad that some people are so immature that they would rate a game based only on the ending instead of the game as a whole.\n\nPros: They've improved the combat cover system over Mass Effect 2, the cover system, once you get used to it, is a far better system.  They also brought back some of the modding that was done in Mass Effect 1 but the system is not as clunky and is stream lined.  You also have a HUGE arsenal of weapons to choose from so you can tailor the weapons to how you like to fight.  I also like that your crew will actually move around on the ship, Sometimes you find them with various crew members in different rooms on the ship depending on where the story is, It makes the crew and ship feel more organic instead of linear like ME 1 & 2 where all your crew stays in the same place.  Even if you don't like the ending, the rest of the game (99% of it) is really good and pretty much ties everything together.\n\nCons: As others have said your choices in the game only really affect stuff like your romances and friendships, because in the end your basically given 3 endings to choose from regardless of what choices you made in all 3 games.  It would of been nice if they could of created 3 branches to the various endings based more on what you did in the game, but with that being said, it's still 100 times better then most games that give you ZERO options..  The Illusive man story was a bit anti-climatic, I think they could of done a better job with him.  You have to use EA's Origin system which has to verify all your DLC each time you start the game, so if their authentication server is down you can't play the game.  It's a stupid security measure because people who pirate games will find a work around so in the end EA only ends up punishing people who actually buy the game.\n\nTIP: wait until all the credits are done after you complete the game there is a bit more story left....\n\nBottom Line: This game is well worth the price tag to play it even if you have to put up with EA's stupid Anti-Pirating measures..", "summary": "Great Trilogy with a few flaws", "unixReviewTime": 1393977600}

I am not a BF junkie by any means, however, if you are looking to add a title and getting bored because nothing else is out, this will keep you entertained. I actually feel it is better than BF3 in many ways, the obvious one is graphics using the 64 OS and Direct X 11. It is good but expect about the same game play, campers, vehicle attacks, long and sometimes dull interludes. Best parts, no more spraying bullets forever to get a frag like last version and maps are more urban and interesting. Became more mainstream in this version, if you hated BF3, you will probably like this one, and vice versa. Personally hated BF3. Update: After some further playing, this game it quite challenging to run on a mid range PC, frames will drop below 30 on any higher resolution and the spike up sporadically. It is certainly a high end rig sort of game if planning on using the higher settings. There are still some \"rubber banding\" problems with getting stuck, this has been addressed as of late. On the whole, it's not bad depending on expectations. Runs decent in the middle resolutions, 30-40 fps, actually had to drop down from 1920, a little lacking for performance.

You're  a scavenger, Joule in a desert planet searching for parts while encountering 4 (technically 5) robot AI which accompany you on your journey.\n\nGameplay is split up into 3 parts: world/dungeon exploration, platforming puzzles, and the other a fun arcade third person shooter.\n\nExploration and dungeon crawling is okay, you can scavenge for core and parts/blueprints for upgrades whether it's your gun or your robot companions. Down side is if you're not used to old school open world adventure games then it may be off putting especially during fetch quests where you have to collect 6 or 7 of the same items to open a door. There's no hint system like in Uncharted 4 for example where they tell you where the last item or hints to solve the puzzle. This can be frustrating at times when you have 5 out of 6 items to progress through the dungeon and you have to keep wandering around the map for minutes to find it or look it up online. One item took me maybe 15mins of wandering around to find on my own. Also certain areas have you use 2 of your 4 robot companions (the 5th one is just a transporter/fast travel) to get through the level or mini-dungeon, this is a hassle when you only can have 2 at given time instead of 3 and you have to go back to your base to swap them out. Basically in terms of puzzles and exploration the game doesn't hand hold you, and you have to figure everything out yourself or play an advance game of hide and seek. Also some story missions are locked until you find certain item/core requirements so there' a lot of item grinding involved.\n\nThere's a lot of platforming puzzles in the game where you use your abilities to jump though timed levels to get a specific item/finish a quest. If you're not good at 3D platforming or have fast reactions speed this may be frustrating also\n\nCombat in this game is very fun, as you have to switch to different colored bullets, dodge and call your robot companions to build combos for exp.\nThere's an auto-aim feature, but the combat is very fast pace where you have to prioritize enemies and dodge incoming attacks testing your reflexes. Once you get into it it's very exhilarating. Too bad the game have to go through a lot of fetch quests, if it was just combat all the way through i'd say it would be a better game\n\nGraphics are okay. Not top of the line graphics but pretty decent. There are some frame rate stutters at times when there's a lot of enemies on screen.\n\nOverall this is not a casual game that you pick up and play through the story.

Regret and hatred is all he is made of now.\nIf you're not familiar with Spawn, he was originally a CIA agent who was slain when he tried to quit. He went to Hell, and made a deal with the Devil to lead their forces in exchange for seeing his loved wife again. Unfortunately for Spawn, he's sent back disfigured and without a memory, so he wears a full body outfit and only slowly remembers his past.\nIn the game, you start out barely remembering your wife and a burning pain. You're in New York City and an unknown attacker is causing trouble, and you decide to take it on. Soon there are legions of demons jumping through the streets for you to slay in bloody gore.\nYou've got a fascinating array of Hell-powers including time slowdown and chain weapons. Those familiar with the comic book tale will enjoy submersing in an atmosphere very like that world.\nThe gameplay is very linear and directed. You have to clear all enemies in an area before, miraculously, the way becomes clear to move on. You destroy objects near you to find health. There isn't much stealth or thought involved here. You kill, kill, destroy, and move on. Each mission gives you a rating which you can go back to try to improve. You can't save within missions - either you finish it or you have to start from the beginning again.\nIn between missions, you can buy ammo, upgrade weapons or in other ways enhance your character. So it really does matter to do the very best you can on a level to make sure you're ready for the next challenge.\nWe liked the warping effect caused by your weapons as they intersected with walls. On the other hand, we didn't like the sense of Deja Vu - that we were doing in essence the same thing over and over again. Yes, it's an interesting world - but there could have been much more variety in the levels and challenges presented.\nWell worth it if you're a comic book or hack-and-slash fan, but otherwise rent rent it first to see how it appeals to you.", "summary": "Comic Book Hack and Slash", "unixReviewTime": 1078099200}

Honestly, not trying to take anything away from amazon, but you would be better off purchasing this game through steam.  You would save time and possibly hassle if the code doesn't work for some reason.  That being said, I'll get down to the review.\n\nFirst of all, I would love to clear the air a little.  This game, so far, has had a better launch then the past two total war games.  Very few, if any, bugs have persisted with my game.  This game is definitely NOT the same disaster that either Rome II or Attila have both been.\n\nNow that that has been cleared up, lets get to the gameplay.  This game is different than past games have been.  It has the same kind of mixture of time periods as shogun does, but with a lot more lore.  This game is based off of something similar to things like lord of the rings. It has it's own unique style of gameplay and the units are supposed to be things such as vampires, skeletons, dwarfs, goblins, orcs and humans.  So if you don't like this concept, then this game just won't be as fun as things like Rome or medieval or even Napoleon.  As of right now, there are 5 factions that you can play as, and I have to admit the game can get a little repetitive and boring after a while.  This is another reason that I would straight purchase this off of steam, as it makes it easier to download mods and things from the steam workshop which can unlock a lot of the other factions and things for play.  But other than that, the units look very nice, everything is pretty well balanced with a lot of counters and things for some of the bigger units such as monsters and heroes.  I love the graphics of the game, as I have a pretty beefy computer and can play everything on the highest graphics with ease.  So far, this has been one of my favorite total war games to date.\n\nTo summarize my review, this game has come no where near the failure of Rome II or Attila. And, for all the people that compare it to the other total war games, the fact is that this is one of a kind in the franchise.  It's similar, yet different at the same time and you really can't compare it to the classics like the original Rome, Medieval, or even Empire/Napoleon.  This game is different and if you don't think you'll like it after reading this review, well then don't buy it.

With my headphones on, I felt an incredible level of immersion, as I was surrounded by the sounds of insects and birds, and the 5\" screen assaulted me with the bright colors of the jungle. Controls are tight, and they work splendidly with the dual analog sticks and the trigger buttons.\n\nThough this title is not quite on par with its PS3 counterparts, that is not really a criticism, considering that those are among the most acclaimed games of this console generation. In one regard, \"Golden Abyss\" actually outshines its big brothers: treasure collection. In this game, collecting treasures makes way more sense, and it's fun. There are sets of treasures or artifacts, and each one has a relationship with the other pieces in the set. Collecting them becomes much more meaningful (great for subsequent play-throughs), and they each have detailed descriptions and histories attached to them.\n\nMy only complaint is about those cursed touch controls, which pop up too often in this game. I don't feel that this is the fault of the developer, as I'm sure Sony forced them to include that nonsense, as well as uncomfortable portions of the game where you must tilt the Vita (sort of like the early days of the Six Axis, when Sony forced developers to implement its features). The strength of the Vita is that it's an alternative to every other device out there, which all use touch controls. The Vita, by contrast, has dual analog sticks and REAL buttons, which work perfectly. Why they want to stray from that at times, and get into the touch controls (which don't work nearly as well) is beyond me. Don't let that minor complaint prevent you from picking this game up, if you own a Vita. This is the best game for the system, in my opinion, and the best portable game I've ever played.

McBeth", "reviewText": "Soul Calibur continues it's reign over the fighting with weapons game genre. With the latest installment, some things that you enjoyed about previous titles remain while new features have been added.\nIn addition, Soul Calibur III's misplaced create-a-character strategy game is gone. For some reason a lot of people thought that SC III wasn't quite the same, or up to par. But it did introduce some new characters, and they -- among some other new/special characters-- return for the 4th Soul Calibur.\n\nWhen first heard that Star Wars was going to make an appearance, it was met with considerable skepticism. But, in the PS3 version Darth Vader and his apprentice are welcome characters. They are integrated by an added \"Force Bar\" which allows them to use the force until it runs out or is replenished.\n\n__Gameplay__\nThe characters feel solid in this one. You can perform some amazing moves with each of the characters, in addition to the new feature of performing a \"critical\" on your opponent. Criticals are performed by first knocking off a piece of armor, and then attacking the vulnerable spot. When the opponent's Soul Gauge is depleted you can perform the Critical, no matter what their health status is.\nInstead of just gaining \"levels\" to show what kind of fighter you are, the levels actually correspond to abilities of that character. All characters in the game and even those that you create have the ability to become better / stronger. Take Taki for instance. After using her for a bit she gains a couple of levels and in the Create-A-Character customization, you can give her a different weapon and change her skills to give her bonuses or abilities during battle. Some are passive, but some can be activated using power from the Soul Gauge. One of Taki's abilities is to become invisible for a period of time (Repeatedly press default [R2]). Some other abilities that could be added were the ability to drain the opponents Gauge with impacts, or to steal some of their HP. The \"Appeal\" ability works on gaining an advantage over opponents of the opposite sex, but hurts the character when fighting against the same sex.\n\nAnother feature is the Tower of Souls. The idea is that as you work you way up the Tower, the enemies become harder. After you work you way to the top, you've given the option of descending below the Tower, into its depths, for more challenges.\n\nOf course, Gold is the currency of the game, and it's how you unlock weapons, some of the initial characters, clothing/items for customization, and the extra features such as special animations, illustrations, etc.\n\n_Online_\nAnother new feature, this one is going to take some getting used to. As it stands now, the feature does need some work. Nice idea, but poor execution. Hopefully a patch will update the problems with the online. (For example: when losing in a match you can quit to avoid being beaten without a penalty for quitting, and the would-be winner gains nothing)\n\n_Overall_\nAll in all this is a great title, and a lot of fun to play. The Story and Arcade modes may be short, but have interesting stories and are easily played over and over to gain experience and gold. I'm also intrigued as to what DLC (downloadable content) will be released.", "summary": "Bring on the Souls", "unixReviewTime": 1217462400}

For example, try flying the magic carpet without crashing in to walls or being eaten by a worm. Also there are certain rooms you can only get in to if you insert the gems just right. There's even on where you have to install the gem and run around in circles just right to reveal a ladder. Another room that's a real pain is this tunnel-like room where you paddle and try to escape the tentacles of a monster. I have never seemed to have the ability to escape those tentacles.

I played the original and many other strategy games in the past. This is a full, long review. It may have minor spoilers. I will cover as much as possible. I give Objective reviews whenever I can, not Subjective. I will state my personal opinions when I can. This review may be more subjective for me as I really like this game. Bear in mind XCOM:EU has immense replayability as long as you like turn-based tactical battles. The strategy base part of the game is awesome as well.\n\nPC Special Edition\nVery nice. The extra goodies (soundtrack, ringtones, screen backgrounds) are on the second disk and easy to get to. The soundtrack is in .wav format, totally useless. This game is Steam activated. I had no problem installing the game. The patch is a little smaller than I would have liked, but I still plan on using it for a camouflage shirt with lots of other game patches. The poster is very neat, and the art book is hardcover, although small. Overall, the SE Edition is quite nice.\n\nGraphics\nThey look terrific! Only a few minor glitches here or there. The Deco DLC is awesome, not yet available as of this writing (it was a preorder bonus).\n\nSound\nThe sound is good, with voices for the soldiers. The music is not as eerie as in the original game, but it is still very good. When aliens are being fought the music picks up for the action. Very nice sound.\n\nEarly thoughts\nThe base is very cool, and tactical is as good as ever. Bear in mind, the official Strategy Guide is NOT going to give tactical training! You need to become a good player by playing and figuring out the strategies, that is why it is called a STRATEGY Game. I will give a few tips where I can. I beat this game in two days, took roughly 24 hours, and I missed a lot of sleep.\n\nDifficulty - Easy/Normal or Classic/Impossible?\nIf you are new to this type of game, and especially to XCOM in general, I suggest at least Easy mode. On Easy mode there will be less threat to deal with and more special missions to help you. Also, the alien timetable will be a little longer, so you will have an extra monther or so before fighting the toughest monsters. Aliens are not easier to fight though, they have the same health and stats as Normal mode.\n\nOn Normal mode it took me 8 game months to win. I lost one country early on, Germany, mainly because South Africa asked for a Satellite they really did not need. Normal mode is just that, nothing differrent. This level of difficulty is the most fun in my opinion. (Actually, I prefer Classic mode now!)\n\nClassic and Imposiible difficulties really crank up the action. More enemies in missions and all the aliens get upgraded. Most get +10 Aim (they hit you easier), +10 Defense (-10 for you to hit them), and extra health. Even Thin Men will have 4 health, not 3. This means Grenades are no longer 100% to get kills. Less starting funds, Start with only one base facility (Satellite Uplink), More enemies, countries give fewer scientists/engineers.\n\nAccessory slot\nYou get one accessory slot. The Support soldier can eventually have two. What should you bring to the battle? Early on you have no choice - Grenades. Useful especially if you are new to XCOM style tactical battle. To be honest, this is the ONLY time I use grenades.\n\nScope or Grenade or Nano-fiber/Chitin Armor?\nScope. Scope. Scope! Once you get the Scope, you should seriously think about all soldiers having one. Nano-fiber armor gives +2 armor, VERY useful early in the campaign when you only have Body armor (+1 armor), as Nano-Fiber's +2 gives a total of +3 armor and -may- keep a soldier out of the infirmary when hit by Sectoid/Thin Man pistol fire, although critical hits may still happen. Chitin armor is rare to acquire, and I use it on Assault soldiers. With the best standard armor and Chitin armor my Assault can have 9 life + 14 armor, which when combined with the Assault's Extra Conditioning skill will give a total of 27 health in combat.\n\nScope or Mind Shield?\nMind Shields are hard to get and thus rare, but take them in the Final Mission for your low-Will soldiers as much as possible.\n\nEarly Moves\nEarly in the game you need to concentrate on gettng as many satellites up as possible. This will hopefully lower Alert levels in the country the satellite is deployed and will increase your monthly income. Countries covered will also give scientists and/or engineers per month. When deploying satellites, alert levels are Top Priority, not the continent or credit bonus of the country. Save your satellites until near the end of the month to help respond to Alien alert activity. This is very important as it will allow you to have the most flexibility to repond to Alert levels.\n\nThe Alien Containment facility can wait. In my opinion, this facility is best built much later in the game. It takes up energy and resources better used for satellite facilities.\n\nWorkshops are neccessary to raise your engineer numbers, but only so you can build more satellite uplinks. Laboratories are nearly useless, unless playing on higher difficulty settings, then they are useful because research speeds are much longer.\n\nOne power generator + one thermal generator + one elerium generator, placed all in a row, will give enough power for the whole game.\n\nAll facilities get the +1 bonus if placed next to each other, either horizontally or vertically.\n\nSQUAD\nMy squad typically has 1 Support, 1 Assault, 2 Heavy and 2 Sniper. This is what I use but other players favor Assault more. Your squad composition is up to you.\n\nSupport\nThe weakest offensive unit but the most relied on for support. Eventually can have 3 Medikits. NOTE: All soldiers can carry a medikit as an accessory!\n\nAssault\nTotal offense. I believe making the first enemy reaction shot miss is best, that way you can lead with this offensive tank. Can have up to 27 health, Awesome.\n\nHeavy\nI always go for +100% damage against Robots. VERY useful when facing the tough robot enemies. I also like Shredder Rocket and 2 Rockets. The capability to take 2 shots in a row is also very nice.\n\nSniper\nI like Squad Sight as it allows me to shoot at anything the squad sees. Less useful with Hover armor, but still a good skill. Double Tap is also awesome. I do not prefer the Sniper that can move and shoot, so I take +2 pistol damage.\n\nTactical Battles\nStay together but not all grouped up. If you can't Dash from one side of the formation to the other you are too far apart. Use two mini-squads of support/heavy/sniper and assault/heavy/sniper (different depending on your choice of soldiers or if main soldiers are in the infirmary). When getting ready to enter a doorway, have each mini-squad stand to the SIDE of the doors, never IN FRONT. You could try it the other way but there are certain encounters that may end Very Bad. Take high percentage shots. Sometimes the game will make you miss No Matter What, that's just the way it is.\n\nMove forward slowly! Use Overwatch as much as possible! Almost never Dash to move forward, and only Dash when near 100% certain the coast is clear. I cannot stress this enough. Tactical battles are long, patient affairs.\n\nUse cover as often as you can! Although soldiers in full cover can still be hit, get as much defense as you can. Defensive bonuses make harder to get hit, and you need every advantage you can acquire.\n\nInterceptors\nEmp or Plasma? Well, there are two ships you will encounter that are Main Story ships. No matter what you do, these ships will still have a good complement of soldiers. You can always get more artefacts from other missions, squad survivability is paramount so go with Plasma or the late tech Interceptor weapon. Use the EMP until you get Plasma or Fusion.\n\nGrey Market\nAlmost everything you bring back from battle is useful. Only sell useless items on the Grey Market. Do not sell corpses as almost all have a use. Eventually some can be sold. Early in the campaign it is ok to sell some things, but usually unwise. For example, in my current game I have 4 UFO Power sources and 4 Navigations left. I built several key units and have no more real need for these items. However, they would be needed if I lost Firestorms. And these numbers are for most of the game! If I had sold any of these items I would not have been able to build all the stuff I needed. Therefore, Be Carefull selling on the Grey Market!\n\nOVERALL\nXCOM:EU is a great game. I am certain I may not have included everything I wanted, but this review is very long. I hope it all helps.\n\nI LOVE THIS GAME!", "summary": "XCOM:EU PC SE Full Review with Tips", "unixReviewTime": 1350691200}

It's single greatest strength is the game play mechanics of the bionic arm. The arm serves as both a weapon and a means of swinging from place to place, which for me was allot of fun while being very challenging. Unlike games like Prince of Persia where you just hit a button at the right time to \"link\" your next acrobatic stunt, in Bionic Commando you have to time your swings and line up your next swing with much precision and grace. Personally I enjoyed the challenge of perfecting my \"swing\", because it is lots of fun and soaring through the air has a sort of innocent quality that I very much enjoyed. Though the negatives are a lack luster story, mediocre graphics (though the environments themselves are well put together, the textures are just nowhere near as sharp/clean as they should be), and somewhat boring combat. The combat plays like an arcade shooter from 1995, no cover system (similar to Gears of War or Drakes Fortune is sorely lacking) and a very very basic AI hinder this game from being memorable in light of far more advanced games available on the market. But hey, for less than $10 bucks its worth playing this game to experience the unique and distinct swing mechanics, that is if you have the patience to master it.", "summary": "Bionic Commando Review", "unixReviewTime": 1278460800}

Bigger, meaner, and more epic than either of its predecessors Dark Souls 2 represents a stunning achievement in design and execution. It welcomes new players with a friendlier tutorial and improved mechanics, but veterans of the Souls series need not be worried. Dark Souls 2 is brutal and challenging, testing you every step of the way with tough bosses and overwhelming odds. But Dark Souls 2 is also beautiful and stunning, featuring a world that is well worth exploring every nook and cranny, from dark and dead pits to harrowing civilizations long lost in time above the clouds. Dark Souls 2 is nothing short of a masterpiece, through and through.\n\nStory, Presentation, and World  10/10/10  10\n\nThe story of Dark Souls 2 is a fantastical tale of kingdoms lost in time, ruled by monsters and hostile forces ready to challenge the player. Similar to the previous games, Dark Souls 2 is a mildly minimalistic game in terms of delivering information; the player must explore and discover most of the world himself or herself. Its an impressive story and world, with a staggering amount of thought behind its deep lore and characters. Its a world filled with mystery, where the players imagination is key to understanding and connecting the loose ties between characters and their place in Drangleic. And Im sure the ending will be something discussed by Souls fans for years to come.\nDark Souls 2 also features a significant upgrade in presentation values. Things are cleaner, nuanced elements in character building are more clear and menus are designed with a greater emphasis on ease of use. Its all still very much like the previous games, just refined and improved to perfection.\n\nGraphics and Art Direction  9/10  9.5\n\nThe world of Drangleic is an epic land ripe for exploration. Half of this experience, though, is the staggeringly huge variety of places youll visit while on your quest. Decrepit crypts, castles in the sky, and even the garbage bin of Drangleic itself, the art direction for Dark Souls 2 continues the FromSoftwares creative trend in developing horrendous creatures and placing them in a fascinating world. There are tons of unique bosses and enemies out for your hollow head, and each and every one is animated with a certain professionalism only a Japanese studio could produce. Along with these disturbing denizens of Drangleic, the places youll visit are equally impressive; not simply because of their design but also the character, increased color pallet and pure imagination every new area brings. To say that Dark Souls 2s art direction is great would be a crime; it is simply stunning, and is one of a kind.\nGraphically, Dark Souls 2 is superior to its predecessors in many ways. Youll be happy to know that the game runs at a steady 30 FPS throughout (PS3) to 60 FPS (360 version is more consistently smoother, PS3 does hit 60 FPS in enclosed and small areas) and technically performs without a hitch. The big improvement here is the animations, which have benefited immensely from being motion captured. Elements of your character react with realism, and enemies feel lifelike and move like they should. The improved lighting engine creates a surprising sense of immersion (although is not the lighting engine we were advertised last year), and the improved physics engine is icing on the cake (characters armor, such as loincloths and hoods flow in the wind and react realistically). Grainy textures and anti-aliasing problems do occur more often than I wouldve like to see (and are simply limitations of the Xbox 360 and PS3). The dumbed down lighting engine is a disappointment as well as the grainy textures and various visual hiccups, making a next gen version of Dark Souls 2 all the more tantalizing.\n\nGameplay and Design  10/10  10\n\nWhere as Demons Souls introduced us to the impossibly challenging difficulty the series is known for and Dark Souls improved the online and flow of combat, Dark Souls 2 has perfected what the series is known for. Tight and claustrophobic combat headlines the game, while rewarding exploration, online PvP, summoning and aiding other players are all improved. Dark Souls 2 continues the trend of endless tactics with the numerous amount of weapons, which all feel distinct and fun to use. Everything has been improved, refined, and polished. The classic gameplay is still as challenging as ever, too. Fears of Dark Souls 2 dumbing down the difficulty and level of challenge have gone completely unwarranted. If anything, this may be the most challenging of all the Souls games, but also the most fair. Yes, youll die, get punished because of it, and lose your souls (which can be retrieved within the next life) and your human status, if you're human. But Dark Souls 2, unlike its previous entries, clearly explains the effects of items, materials, and penalties. You die because you're unfamiliar with a boss, area, or unique enemy tactic. You only come back stronger, more aware of the dangers you will face and more capable to tackle them quicker with more precision. Of the 245 times I died through my play-through, I rarely felt cheated. Only a few times (fighting optional bosses and online PvP) did I feel this way.\nIn terms of design, Dark Souls 2 is built with the player in mind. Beginning the adventure is tough, as is every video game. Healing items are rare in the beginning, and the Estus Flask only offers a swig at first. But as you explore this hostile and beautiful world, youll be rewarded with new and better armors, lifegems, status ailment healers, new weapons and sometimes the rare shards to improve the Estus Flask. Exploration doesnt get more rewarding than this. Dark Souls 2 also offers a huge collection of memorable boss battles; everything from quick thinking to pure dodging skill is required throughout the many, many bosses that stand in your way. And you will take them all out, I believe in you! Dark Souls 2 is rewarding every step of the way; from its improved, tighter combat, intricate level design and unique character building this is an RPG that sacrifices nothing its famous for, but rather embraces its flaws and only improves upon them.\n\nSound Design and Soundtrack  9/10  9.5\n\nDark Souls 2 will immerse you in more ways than one, and thats mainly because of its subtle sound design. Some say the best sound design is one that you don't even notice; Dark Souls 2 is accomplished in this aspect. Swords will clash and spells will be cast, and they all sound great. The ambience while exploring each area really shines brightly as well. From creepy distant cackles to hollow and decrepit crypts, everything sounds as it should. Voice acting, a small part of all the Souls games, has been improved and expanded here and it is all delivered very well.\nDark Souls 2 features, hands down, the best score for any of the Souls games. Each boss fight has its own unique theme, memorable and musical enough to listen to outside the game. The tragic and intense orchestration and score really highlights each boss fight, making each an assault on the senses and emotions (and the emotional depth of the soundtrack itself is stunning). And don't worry, the classic finale aria is beautiful and thoroughly composed with a purpose. Mr. Motoi Sakruaba, take a bow.\n\nLasting Appeal  10\n\nUnlike previous Souls games, once the credits roll there is still more to do. An altered new game plus allows people to continue to explore past the credits which is excellent for those who want to continue their adventure and clear optional areas. The game does have the classic new game plus, though, in which you do less damage while enemies do more. There are multiple new challenges that await players in new game plus, all of which require new tactics and skills. Aside from that, players can re-spec their characters to try different builds, join and work through multiple covenants, beat optional bosses and work your way through PvP. Dark Souls 2 offers a lot to do post-credits.\n\nFinal Score - 10/10\n\nDark Souls 2 took me just about 52 hours to complete (final time - 51:50) and I died 245 times. Oddly enough, though, every minute within this world was incredible. Drangleic is a gorgeous and oddly inviting world to explore, and your adventure will take you to the far corners of this hostile place, fighting off monsters and battling players along the way. It was an immensely satisfying and enjoyable game, and most of all it felt incredibly fair the entire way through. It is not only one of the best games I have ever played, but it gives reasons for video games to exist. Only in video games can you receive the same sense of exploration and discovery that Dark Souls 2 offers, and thats why its such a grand masterpiece and a testament to video games as a medium.\n\n(average = 9.8, rounding to 10 based on 20 point scale)", "summary": "Go Beyond Death (And Have Fun The Entire Way)", "unixReviewTime": 1395619200}

When I had the 360 I used the X12's and loved them. I knew there were better models but at the time I didn't think of any to invest in headsets.\n\nFor the Xbox one I was in a tug of war on which headset to purchase. At first I did purchase the Polk 4 shots. Those were great especially if you're looking for an all around headset, for gaming, music and on the go. But they lacked the bass and loud volume I was accustomed coming from the X12's. I wanted to try something new and pulled the trigger to get a pair of Astro's. For those who are really stuck between the A40 and A50 it really is on preference. Do you care about cables running everywhere or prefer a wire free setup? If you're gaming on your desk then I would suggest the A40 but for me the best setup was to go with the wireless feature. I did purchase these at best buy because of reward points that I had built up to decrease the high price tag. With the dropped price I decided to also invest in their protection program since I was already planning to drop $300. Before using these headsets make sure to update the amp and headset firmware. It was pain free and very simple. I used my mbp to update the firmwares.\n\n*Comfort/Design*\n- Looking at the headband I thought it was going to be slightly uncomfortable because it appeared to lack some band padding. I was wrong. They were very comfortable. These are slightly heavier than your average headset because of they carry the wireless features to broadcast the signal. I used them on average 2-3 hours of gaming. The band provided a nice soft cushion on top of my head and as well as the ear cups. I would say one of the best ear cushions. Most headsets I've used usually rubs on the side of my ears such as mesh and sometimes irritates me. I usually prefer a leather padding but these felt like pillows around my ears imo. The ear cups completely surrounded my ear and my ears did not touch the drivers. The padding is a very soft material and once they break in I can see them becoming more comfortable. Overall I had no issues in the comfort area. I loved it. As for design and looks I really like the Astro's If you have a small head, having these on will make you look like you have horns which imo look cool. The touch of red wiring is nice addition. The areas where the buttons on the headset to balance out chat and volume is easily accessible. The volume scroll on the back of the headset is also easily accessible.\n\n*Sound*\n- I was always interested in trying a headset that used an amp and surround sound. Trying them in Battlefield 4 and Titanfall they sounded amazing. Upgrading to the xbox one I wanted a new headset. I went with the Polk 4 shots and they were great for a stereo headset but lacked a little bit in sound quality, in regards to bass and loudness. The surround sound dolby digital 7.1 is amazing! Such a huge difference from a stereo output. I knew there would be a difference in sound quality but I didn't think it would be a large difference. The surround sound provide a more immerse experience than my previous headsets. The highs, mids and lows were clear and crisp. When things needed to be louder or low in regards to distance was just right. I was able to pin point the direction of a shoot out. Hearing footsteps was clear and in Titanfall I was able to hear if an enemy was wall running. You can really crank the volume up to your desire with these headsets. With the Xbox one I made sure to fully lower the game audio on the adapter by pushing the player icon to boost the chat volume up to ensure I was receiving/hearing the amps broadcast. In Battlefield 4 I ended up playing around with all my kits to hear the different weapons and they sounded amamzing. A part of me wished I picked up the BF4 edition because apparently their setting is really targeted for shooters. You can still purchase the BF4 A50s through Astro's website or find them in some gamestops and best buys. I settled with the standard edition. Overall I'm loving the sound quality. Best sound I've heard and used so far!\n\n*Mic*\n- The mic is decent and works. I used and tested it with players in a lobby and also in a private party. Everyone said I sounded loud and clear. No complaints if I sounded muffled, distorted or static. I do like the feature if you need to mute you could swing your mic up or just push the adapter. But I've grown accustom to bring the mic up. I'm prefer mics that are covered up with foam to prevent wind detection but no complaints from my teammates of breathing or anything. If you're using a X1 make sure to update your head and amp firmware. Also purchase the X1 adapter and update that and the controller. A side note, don't settle for these ridicolous prices some sellers are offering on amazon for the adapter! Just look around, I was lucky to find the last one at bestbuy for $25 unlike these re-sale prices of $45+. Back to the mic, overall its works for me and no complaints!\n\n*Packaging* (Not important but just wanted to mention i)\n- I love Astro's packaging. The A50s comes in a large casing that is designed with great artwork. Opening it was pain free and easy to take out the headsets unlike some unboxings I've experienced. The headsets are protected and held in place. Barely any paper work but a nice colored folder that is use for a quickstart.\n\n*Overall Rating*\nOut of 5 I give these headsets a 4.5/5. I rate them a 5 because of the price I was able to purchase them along with a protection plan. Luckily I had some rewards on my bestbuy account. If you can swallow the price of $300 I really recommend these especially if you're looking for a wire free setup. They sound amazing. If you play shooters especially Battlefield 4, Titanfall or COD. I would say to try and pickup the BF4 edition as it provides a equalizer mode targeted to shooters. If you're stuck between the A40s or A50s, remember its all preference and if you care about wires. If you game on a desk I would highly say the A40s because the mixamp provides a more precise sound control. If you're like me who wants to be care free of wires I would highly recommend these! I'm very happy with my purcahse!", "summary": "Great wireless headset for the xbox one.", "unixReviewTime": 1395532800}

I am not limited to fan service games, I collect those violent banned games and Japan only releases. Rule of Rose is still one of my lucky finds back in the day. If people hate it, I probably got it, or it's on my want list. Sadly fan service games like Senran Kagura will probably never become acceptable and mainstream like Grand Theft Auto Doom and Duke Nukem did.\nSenran Kagura Estival Versus is tons of fun though. Like Dynasty warriors, simple but entertaining. Yes, if you know the series you know about intimacy mode in the dressing room and it's in this game as well. The intimacy mode creeps me out a bit, but I I find it funny and don't take it too seriously. It's definitely worth playing and owning.

Hartman", "reviewText": "As a fan of the X-Com games and Shadow Watch, I was really looking forward to this game.  Based on the Editorial Reviews on this site, I was expecting somethiing in a similar vein.\nUnfortunately, there are some subtle  problems with this game that make it vastly inferior to the previously  mentioned titles, and cause the game play to be rather slow and  frustrating.\nProblems with the tactical level:\n#1.  Extremely long  fights:  Most of the weapons in this game are frustratingly innacurate and  don't do much damage.  As a result, fights go on and on and on and on and  on and . . well, you get the idea.  In X-Com and Shadow Watch, fire fights  tend to be relatively quick and decisive.  If a bad guy steps out in front  of you without cover, he goes down.  In this game though, he can stand  right in front of you at a range of three or four spaces and it will still  take a few turns to kill him.  You shoot and miss, and shoot and miss and  so on.  And then when you finally do hit the guy, it takes five or six  shots to take him down. Your mouse hand will get sore from all the point  and clicking. Both the accuracy and the lethality of all the weapons in the  game should be about doubled or trippled, which would lead to shorter, more  decisive engagements. 2.  Computer controlled characters have a huge  advantage in accuracy:  This is a weird glitch that becomes really obvious  from about the second fight onwards.  All computer controlled units are  roughly two to three times as accurate as your (supposedly elite) mercenary  units.  What does this mean? A couple of examples: a.)  One of your  mercenaries (with a high accuracy rating) is lying on the ground, firing at  an opponent lying on the ground, with no intervening cover.  The computer  controlled character will hit you about four times for every time you hit  him. b. You have a unit which has carfully positioned itself crouching  behind a tree for cover, shooting at a computer unit standing in the open.  You will hit each other with about the same frequency.\nWhile over all  game balance is preserved by the fact that your mercs can just take so damn  much damage, it still makes game play awefully frustrating.  Here you are,  knocking yourself out to find good covered positions to protect your guys,  and the computer still hits them easily, while you're missing its guys that  are out in the open. The problem becomes even more annoying once you start  training local militia to protect your villages.  Being computer  controlled, the local militia also benefit from this huge increase in  accuracy, which means that they completely outclass the mercenaries who  trained them.  Which makes you wonder why they needed your mercenaries to  come liberate them in the first place.\nProblems with the Strategic  Level:\nUnbalance Economy:  Simply put, the amount of money running around  in the game doesn't balance out against the cost of most items.  Local  Militia, for example, can be trained for $750, a sum so small by comparison  to what your mines are turning out that it doesn't even enter into your  strategic thinking.  Similarly, the rewards for completing quests in the  game are ludicrously small wnen compared to your income.  What do you say  to a major NPC who is trying to get you to do some major quest by offering  you 20K dollars.  \"Hello, I make more than that in a single day of  mining.  Why should I bother?\".  The numbers on a lot of this stuff  need to be adjusted. 2.  A preponderence of innefectual hand guns:  For  some reason, most of the mercs that you can afford at the start of the game  come equipped with hand guns rahter than assault rifles.  Excuse me?  A  professional merc who's going to airdrop into the middle of a civil war  with only a pistol?  This is particularly ludicrous when you realize how  innefectual handguns are in this game.  Even at close range, an NPC is  likely to die of old age long before you ever manage to finish him off with  a .38 revolver. Adding to this problem is the fact that you can't buy  rifles.  Oh sure, the nice mail order company that you do business with  will send you ammo, but not big guns, grenades, night vision goggles, or  any of the really cool stuff that you want to play with.  To get that  stuff, you have to ever so slowly find it off the bodies of dead enemies.  In the course of 15 hours of play, I managed to find only two rifles.  Unfortunately, they were of a calliber that I couldn't buy ammo for.  Arrg.  Why can't you just buy decent armaments in this game?\nOverall, I would  have to encourage people to buy all the X-Com games and Shadow Watch before  buying this one.  And even then, I would replay the former titles again  before sending buying this one.  Firefights in Jagged Alliance are  needlessly long and indecisive, there is little variation between combat  locations and opponents, and there is a lot of built in frustration in the  fact that your units are so vastly inferior to those controlled by the  computer.  This is a game with a lot of subtle problems that should have  been caught in the beta testing.", "summary": "Editorial Reviews Missed some Key Points", "unixReviewTime": 963792000}

Peterson", "reviewText": "******Update on 9-7-15 See below (after my original review) why I am putting this game away, possibly for good\nSo far, a good solid game. I bought on Amazon.\nWhat you need to know for the PC download version:\n1.  You need a Steam account.  You buy the code from Amazon, log onto Steam and enter the code and download and play on Steam. Once you download and install (I played it the first time logged in and online) you can play offline without an internet connection.\n2.  You should have at least an i5 (recommended i7) computer with a good HD graphic card.  It won't work without a good high powered HD graphic card.  I don't remember the recommended minimum so log onto the Mad Max (MM) site and read the minimum required.\n\nI have only played 4.5 hours so this is only my first impression.\nGraphics:  Good high resolution graphics.  Lots of detail even down to facial looks.  I did find them a bit drab but that is due to the setting and not the high res graphics.  It is set in the desert with lots of gray scale colored rocks, gray scale colored sand, and rust colored scrap iron objects (old cars, rusted boats, old equipment).\nGameplay:  challenging and often interesting.  There is no beginner mode so people like me who are not proficient and  are not quick reaction players find it challenging at times.  One time I displaced a sniper out of a tower and have no clue how I did it. I went up to the tower on foot, started to pull my shotgun out and without aiming somehow managed to fire the shotgun and dislodge him out of the tower.  In that takeover (of the compound) I never found another shotgun shell to replace the one I fired so be aware resources are scarce and hard to come by.  I had to do hand to hand combat the rest of the scenario.  I'm not a proficient player and it took me over a half hour to figure out how to stop the oil rig.  An experienced player probably could have done it in not time at all.\nGame mechanics:  There is a ton of stuff and upgrades to do.  As you build up your character and car you get more powerful and into hundreds of different situations.  It is open world but when I just wandered about looking for stuff (not story line related) it was boring.  But I just scratched the surface and imagine with more time there will be tons of stuff to do that are not necessarily story related. The map is gigantic so that indicates lots and lots of stuff to do.\nFighting:  The harpoon is kinda of cool, the shotgun (if you can ever find a shotgun shell) is powerful but use your one or two shots wisely.  The hand to hand combat is pretty cool and fortunately when you are fighting four or five villains they all line up and usually only attack you one or two at a time (the others stand by and wait their turn).  In one combat situation I was in, there was a knife on the ground.  I picked it up but it would only let me use it at a specific time.  In other words, I could not just pull the knife and wale on the villains, I had to wait until the computer let me use the knife.  I had no shotgun shells left so any guns were out of the equation. The good news is that even with my poor proficiency, I still beat the bad guys!  I'm sure there are tons of cool weapons but so far I haven't got that far (an may never will).\nMy impressions:  A bunch of young guys were given the Mad Max scenario and directed (read paid) to developed a game around the concept.  The jokes are pretty much teenage level, the young guys made the scarce resources part of the game because they thought it would make the game more fun to play (a mistake in my book), the graphics are top notch but drab by nature of the environment, and the game will be very fun to play by the target group (teens to young adults + some).\n********Update 9-7-15 I am now 7 hours into the game\nI am putting this game away and may never play it again.  There are lots of reasons but the bottom line is for me it is not fun.  Here are a couple of small things that take the fun out of the game:\n1.  The blowing sand is driving me crazy.  They way over did it but the final straw was when I made a big jump, went airborne, and when I hit the sand, the puff of sand was not where I hit but in front of me and then I had to drive through it.  Boy, that made it fun!\n2.  The developers felt it would make the game fun by making resources scarce. Big mistake.  So I drive to a spot on the map marked \"Scavenging Location\".  But guess what, nothing there ---- and then I read the note that says, \"scavenging locations can contain useful items\".  The key word here is \"can\".  Why put a scavenging location on the map and have it contain nothing to scavenge?  Real fun --- NOT!  At a different place I did find one more shotgun shell for my shotgun.  I now have two.  That was real fun.\n3.  The \"Open World\".  This one is really fun.  No resources (oh, except a lot of blowing sand). When you get to something like a big storage container, you can't climb on top of it or you get to an old rusty pick-up truck and you can't climb into the bed --- that's real fun.  But don't worry, there are no resources anyway so why bother.  Hum, why bother.\nThe game does have a lot of things going for it and a lot of people will have fun playing it but not me.

Johnson", "reviewText": "After making the mistake of trading this version in for the 360 version, I finally decided to trade the 360 version in to get my old XBOX Double Agent back after being dissapointed with the 360 version.\n\nI won't even go into graphics and sound, because as always they are great.  No big improvments from Chaos Theory, but that is not a bad thing since the visuals and audio in CT were near perfect.\n\nThe actual storyline is kind of a twist from past Splinter Cell titles, instead of working solely for the NSA, you actually become a double agent to bring down the terrorist organization, the JBA from the inside.  The things that happen in this game have already happened as you will be able to tell from the cutscreens between the missions.  As a Double Agent, you will be forced to make tough decisions.  Before you choose, you must decide what is most important, the lives of innocent people, or keeping your cover and gaining the trust of the JBA.  But be carefull tip the trust meter too much to one side and your mission will be in jeopardy one way or the other.  Do too many things that help the JBA, and the NSA will threaten call off the mission, Do too many things to help the NSA and the JBA becomes suspicious and your cover may be blown.\n\nThe game mechanics are pretty much the same from past, and you have what seems all of the gadgets and tools you have from past Splinter Cell titles, you can still remote hack, split jump, optic cable, disable cameras, lights and other electronics with your pistol, etc.  Also reappearing in this game is the visibility and sound meter tied to your OPSAT.  For reasons that are beyond me, many of these things Splinter Cell vets have come used to are MIA in the 360 version, one reason why I got the XBOX version of the game back.  While all of these thigs are in the XBOX version what makes this game different is the fact you are forced to make decisions and they can be nerve racking, (in a good way).  One example is that you are forced to make a decision on whether you want to allow the JBA to set off a bomb on a cruise ship or bug the phone bomb so it won't go off.  You are screwed either way, and the decision is up to you.  The double agent aspect of a game is a interesting twist, and makes the game pretty fun and helps the replay value because there is potentially many different outcomes of the game.\n\nAs I said in my title this game is not the best of the splinter cell titles.  This is not because of the double agent aspect, it because the missions do not seem as fun as missions in previous Splinter Cells.  Things can sometimes seem to drag along making an already stealthy game, more tedious and time consuming.  The first couple of levels were really like this, but now that I am getting further into the game, it seems to be getting better.  I also have a much greater appreciation of this title after playing the obviously rushed, unpolished 360 version.\n\nSaves in this game is very forgiving.  You still have save points, but you can also save AT any point in the game and you have an unlimited number of them.  This translates to not being forced to do things over and over again, which is one of my pet peeves with video games.  I am not sure if using \"too many\" saves will affect your stats or mission performance, but from what I have seen it doesn't.\n\nThere is also a multiplayer mode, which I haven't played and more than likely will not be playing online, and if you check my past reviews on multiplayer games, you will know why.\n\nWhile this game is not the best Splinter Cell title, an award I will still give to the very first game in the series, I still think it is a very good game.  If you have an XBOX and an XBOX360 and are debating on which Double Agent you should get, take it from someone who has owned both, get the REGULAR XBOX version!

{"overall": 3.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "11 18, 2016", "reviewerID": "A2K7OP4VPIHQU9", "asin": "B00004ZDFY", "reviewerName": "Chalgyr&#039;s Game Room", "reviewText": "While we could debate backwards compatibility all day and until some of us are blue in the face because weve been holding our breaths for so long, the idea of PS2 games upscaled onto the PS4 with trophy support may be as good as we get. There are PS1 and PS2 classics for the PS3 and the Vita but its not the same as being able to take out the case for the game you want to play from two generations ago and insert its disk it into the most current generation.\n\nOn the subject of two generations ago, Dark Cloud was an early PS2 title. I own it physically for the PS2 but I own it because my brother loved it. Up until recently for this years Extra Life I had maybe done the first few floors as I had played much more of its Steampunked sequel Dark Cloud 2 (or Dark Chronicle in Japan). Figuring why not, I loaded up Dark Clouds PS4 port for part of my marathon and while nostalgia can be a great thing, sometimes, things don't quite scale well with time.\n\nBefore Yo-Kai Watch, before White Knight Chronicles, Rogue Galaxy, Dragon Quests VIII & IX*, was Level 5s first title. Designed for the PS2 at the beginning of its lifespan was a Roguelike that saw a young man named Toan (if you took the default) who was charged with restoring the world after surviving the Dark Genies attack. Needing to go into dungeon after dungeon in order to find people and buildings that were essentially time bubbled in order to spare them being annihilated, Toan has his work cut out for him.\n\nFrom a design standpoint Dark Cloud is great. Multi-leveled dungeons with a thirst system (instead of hunger) and breakable weapons alongside a bit of a Simulation Town Builder and this Roguelike was in the bag. Even now the concepts that it works off of are great, however, the controls in which how to effectuate all of this? They felt awful and I would need to load the original version as Im not sure if they remained the same or if the PS4s controller was simply that much more sensitive than the PS2s.\n\nWhen it came to the controls it was an accumulation of things. Hitboxes could feel off as sword swings wouldnt connect however monsters would simply hit you because you're standing too close even if you couldn't hit them. They hadnt even taking a swing or a bite at you either, they simply were standing too close and voila, loss of HP. That I know comes from the design aspect of a 2D roguelike in which if an enemy bumps up beside you then say goodbye to said HP but when in a 3D world in which you need to get up close and personal? It doesnt work.\n\nThe other portion of the overall design that drove me nuts was the long winded tutorials that lead to well do it yourself and youll understand better. I would have preferred the do it yourself from the beginning and save the frustration. More than that that however is that a lot of the features that I could have used on the first few floors? Those were all given much further down and would have saved loads of headaches such as how to lock on. It sounds dumb, but without knowing that O was there for facing the camera behind you AND targeting? I had a swell time on those floors.\n\nIn regards to the floor, Dark Clouds dungeon designs are among my favorite. Dungeon floors are random in regards to floor layouts and coming in and out was made easy by allowing Toan to restart from any floor thats already been cleared. Clearing floor 2 for example allowed for starting at floor 3. Better than this, once a floor was cleared then it was easy to head back to town to buy more supplies instead of heading down another level and possible biting the dust. If you really needed to escape then an item could be used but generally they weren't required.\n\nDungeon floors themselves were intriguing as some could hold two halves. Theres the normal half in which everything youll need is present such as the shells in which people or town parts can be acquired as well as the key to the next floor. Then there was the other half in which monsters were much harder but the possible rewards were more than worth exploring their depths. The items required to explore these other halves were not always present however which would be rather disappointing especially if you had the resources to possibly survive.\n\nAs the story advances it becomes clear that if you are not a completionist, this may really not be for you. In several cases it was required to dive back into older floors in order to obtain missing parts of the world in order to unlock the way forward. This could either come in the form of an obtainable item or of an additional playable character such as a stray cat that turns into a humanoid or a genie after being summoned from a lamp. Each character adds a bit of extra to the dungeon designs as only they can bypass certain elements.\n\nNow while each new character can add new elements to the dungeons, in a lot of cases it may come down to you not wanting to use them for more than their dungeon mechanics. By the point that even the first new party member is added, its possibly been hours and youve upgraded Toan both in regards to his weapons and to his health and thirst meters. Each new character starts with weapons that are mediocre at best and in the case of the third available character? Hes too slow to hit anything before enemies take him out while he was trying to swing. This wouldnt have been an issue however each dungeon has locked floors in which one of these other characters is the only available one and in almost every case these floors were hell. I say hell because either the character did little to no damage or simply was too slow to ever lay a hit. I hoped every time that the first or second monster would lead me to the key in order to leave.\n\nBut if youve upgraded Toan why don't you upgrade them? Honestly while I asked myself this, unfortunately not every time a treasure chest was opened did it grant another character a weapon. More often than not it was a new weapon for Toan and not someone else even if someone else opened the chest. Once a new weapon was acquired however then it had to be used to be leveled up so most of the time, new weapons were acquired, equipped, and were generally left un-upgraded as that character was only used on locked floors.\n\nWeapon upgrading itself was fun as it allowed for a fair amount of customization as weapons gained experience when used in order to become more powerful. Once ready to level, materials that offered bonuses could be fused in for permanent boosts. This meant that keeping multiples of certain weapons was not a bad idea as one could specialize in destroying the undead while another could be designed for dealing lots of fire damage. Once a weapon passed level five (not sure if that was on purpose of not but well done Level-5!) then it could be broken down into an upgrade material of its own containing sixty percent of its power. This means that older weapons were never useless as they could always be used in one way or another.\n\nWhere things broke down, literally, is that if a weapon broke, thats it. It was gone. Any fan of roguelikes or older Fire Emblems know this pain. The only weapon that could not shatter into the abyss of your broken heart as it disappeared from your inventory was your first weapon making it a good idea to infuse stronger weapons into it to make sure that if push comes to shove, youve got a backup. If your first weapon broke then it simply did a fraction of the damage.\n\nWhile three quarters of Toans time will be spent dungeon crawling with his party, the other quarter will be spent building up the lost towns from the pieces acquired in the dungeons. Houses, shops and other establishments can be placed wherever you see fit, though, if you talk to everyone they can tell you what is missing and where they would really like their building to be. I honestly for the most part just put things where I saw fit but thats just me.\n\nBecause not every building is actually useful, it can sometimes be worth waiting until theres enough to put together before putting anything down. Each building can be placed on its own though it will have slots for people and for items. This means that a shop owner for example can be placed but without storage and a sign he won't open shop. Some slots are open by default but others will require talking to the people using that building in order to find out whats missing. This includes asking your mother who gives you crap for not knowing what goes into your own house.\n\nDark Cloud had a lot of interesting ideas from the dungeon crawling to the town building simulation. Unfortunately the controls and some of the design choices of the other characters made it more frustrating that it should have been. By all rights Dark Cloud could have been an epic title instead of just an ok one. I didn't have loads of nostalgia to back this one up as almost all of it was new to me. That being said, although Dark Cloud is now sixteen years old the graphical upgrade to the PS4 and the well aged Cel Shading does make it pretty to look at.\n\n*Dragon Quest VIII & IX were co-developed between Level-5 and Square Enix", "summary": "This is technically a review for the PS4 remade version of the game", "unixReviewTime": 1479427200}

I snagged the PLATINUM trophy after hours of fun. I saw every ending and every piece of the game (including the DLC) and overall: WHAT A REWARDING EXPERIENCE. It's sad that all the love and hard work put into this beautiful story won't be experienced by all because of impatience or from misinformed or trolling reviews from others. Give it chance if you're a patient gamer and don't like to have to be constantly killing someone (COD fans).... It's way worth it!\n\n*****UPDATE 10/12/13*****\n\nGAME COMPLETED! Wow...I have NEVER felt this connected to a video game character like Jodie since Cloud from FF7 or Link in the Ocarina of Time. I do not say that lightly. The story is MASTERFULLY told. I haven't seen a Sci-Fi/action thriller movie in a long time, let alone played a game, that has come anything close the level of what BEYOND: Two Souls has to offer. Stellar graphics and character animations with motion capture technology (which BEATS The Last of Us and I liked that game A LOT). All the negative reviews I've read seem to have missed the mark. This game is inviting YOU to take part in it's STORY. It offers something that VERY FEW video games have to offer, a DEEP emotional CONNECTION and care for the characters you are playing as. I completed the game feeling SAD (watery eyes and all) that it was over! (although the ending I got was VERY satisfying and tailored to my liking). I must note that I've NEVER cried in a video game till I played this one.\n\nI typically buy a game, beat it, and then re-sell. I don't have that plan with BEYOND: Two Souls. It got to me. It really got to me, in a good way. I'm just looking back on the past 10-hours I spent with it and I can't wait to revisit the world. I'm going for the Platinum Trophy for sure.\n\nTHANK YOU David Cage and Quantic Dream for making something that truly stands out and SHINES! This game deserves an EMMY nomination and a GAME OF THE YEAR award of some-sort. No doubt there!\n\n****Original Review****\n\nSo far this game get's full ratings from me. IGN's 6 out of 10 from a no-name reviewer bugged the crap out of me! I still bought the game at full price and am LOVING it 4 hours in. Masterfully told story with a stunning original soundtrack and graphics. This \"game\" is meant to be something different and it's not afraid to show it. Don't expect your same old run-of-the-mill game here. It's an interactive movie with superb acting from motion caught body and facial movements and spot on voice acting. Ellen Paige and Willem Dafoe knock it out of the park! The Soundtrack produced by HANZ ZIMMER (batman, black hawk down) is heart moving and powerful!", "summary": "So misunderstood....such a beautiful experience!", "unixReviewTime": 1381276800}

Johnson", "reviewText": "If you read my review about PGR on the regular XBOX, you would see that I was VERY dissatisfied with the game, mainly due to the fact that the game focused too much on Kudos, and not actual racing, in addition, there was only one difficulty level on the game, PMI (Pretty Much Impossible). Don't get me wrong I like difficult games, but not difficult to the point were it becomes tedious due to cheesy AI and having to start all over again if you make ONE mistake.  Not my idea of fun in the least.  Add to that that the Kudos aspect which made it more important to do stupid tricks rather than race.  PGR1 was only for super hardcore racers that have tons of hours each day to master, I like most people I suspect, don't have the time to spend THAT much time on one game, or on video games period.  I hated PGR1, so much that I didn't even raise an eyebrow when PGR2 came out.  I didn't even raise an eyebrow when PGR3 came out, but after downloading the free demo from XBOX Live, I saw the game was actually kind of fun, and playable.  I decided to rent it a few days later and the very next day I was convinced and went out and bought it.\n\nAs usual the graphics in PGR3 are downright spectacular.  The attention to detail was done so well that the cars and the entire racing experience look pretty much lifelike.  The reflections coming off the cars react to the actual environment, instead of some generic reflection effect.  The actual race environments look real as well and it seems you are actually racing through the street of NYC or Vegas.  The crowds are the only downside, but going 100+ MPH most of the time, you won't have time to sit there any really analyze them.  One cool thing the crowd does is that if you happen to crash into a wall, the people standing right behind the barrier will back up and give you a funny look.  Another cool thing about PGR3 is that they have AUTHENTIC cockpit view, in which you can switch the camera to inside of the car and you will see the actual steering wheel, dashboard, center console of the real life counterparts.  You can even look around in the interior while you are driving using the right thumb stick.  If you are about to get passed by the Ferrari on your right (or left), using the right thumb stick you can literally turn your head to the driver or passenger windows to see as they pass by.  VERY COOL!  If you choose the Manual transmission option (which I always do) you can actually see the driver's hands leave the steering wheel to shift to the next gear in cars that have the gear box in the floor.  Cars that have the F1 paddle shift you will see the driver's finger flick the appropriate paddle.  For cars that only come in Automatic, the drivers hands will be on the steering wheel at all times. I have had the opportunity to drive 6 of these cars in this game in real life on open mountain roads in North Georgia (Ferrari F430, Ford GT, Lamborghini Gallardo, Masserati Grandsport, Bentley GT, Corvette Z06, and I can tell you that this game has the interiors down to the smallest detail.  One thing I wish the game had was being able to do turn completely around while you are driving (or watching a replay) so you would be able to see the engine behind you in cars like the Ferrari and Lambo.  There is some damage done to your cars during racing, but nothing too extreme.  Very frequently your mirrors, tail lights and headlights will get smashed, and if you ram into a wall or get rammed too many times, your hood and trunk become bent and will pop open slightly during the course of the race.  Some may want more damage, but it doesn't bother me too much.\n\nThe sound is also topnotch.  Each car's engine sounds pretty much like the real thing as well as screeching tires.  Cranking the volume up on your surround sound system and hearing the engines roar gives me an adrenalin boost every single time, it makes me want to push the car harder just so I can continue to hear that lovely sound.  I love spinning the tires when I am just playing around and was even expecting to smell the burning rubber on the asphalt.  The game also comes with a wide range of music choices to listen to while you are driving, you can also use your music on your 360's hard drive, an IPOD, or stream music directly from your Media Center PC.  The only thing about custom music though is that its not really integrated into the game like the built in sound track are.  So if you have one of your own songs playing while you are racing, that song will continue to play even if the race is over and you are back on the main screen.  Whereas the built-in soundtracks will be stopped once you stop racing, just you can no longer hear your car's radio if you are no longer in the car.\n\nTo me, the most important part of any game is the actual game play.  PGR1 excelled in graphics and sound, but the actual game play made it one of my most hated games.  Luckily PGR3 has great game play as well.\n\nOne of my main issues with PGR1 was the over emphasis on Kudos, it focused on that way more than it should and it made the game tedious and not fun.  Kudos is back in PGR3, but it has taken sort of a backseat to actual racing, which is the way it should be.  Yes there are still Kudos challenges, but most of the races involve you having to place in the top 3 to advance rather than placing in the top 3 AND getting the specified number of Kudos.  Kudos can still be earned, and are a must to unlock certain cars, but the fun factor of the game keeps you coming back for more even though you raced that same track 10 times already.  Kudos are a lot more forgiving this time around as well, no longer will a slight tap on a wall cause you to lose all the Kudos you were racking up, now you really have to hit it for you to lose them.  This was definitely needed as well.  Honestly, because this game is so fun and not so darn tedious, I find myself actually wanting to rack up Kudos, strange how that works huh?\n\nAnother issue with the original was the ridiculous difficulty and cheap AI that would make it a point to wreck you on purpose, making the game pretty much impossible after you unlocked a certain car.  But that is no longer the case, now PGR has 5 difficulty levels that should satisfy every racing fan (Novice, Easy, Medium, Hard, Hardcore).  I suspect Hardcore was the default level from the original.  Medium is no cakewalk however, and you still have to be on your toes to advance, if you are new to this game, then try some races in Easy to get the hang of it.  Novice is pretty much a waste of time, as it is way too easy.  A good thing about the difficulty levels as that you can choose them before each race in your career, so you are not locked in to one the whole time.\n\nHandling of the cars in this game has also improved greatly.  I remember in PGR1, when I got the Vette, it would spin around for no apparent reason, while CPU controlled cars were like tanks.  No more, there is no an even playing field when it comes to handling. Some cars of course are harder to handle than others, but no more phantom spinning while taking a turn at 20 MPH.  Computer controlled cars still try to wreck you, but not nearly as blatant as PGR1, and if you think that they are going too far, you can wreck them too.\n\nAnother good thing about this game is that you can by any car at any time and not have to depend on the game to decide which car you can use.  So if you gain enough credits (not the same as Kudos), you can buy an Enzo Ferrari right off the bat.  Of course the better cars cost more money, the Mclaren F1 if I remember correctly costs a whopping 1.7 million credits! You earn credits by completing race objective.  There are some cars that you still have to earn the right to buy by accumulating enough Kudos, but there are TONS and TONS of cars that are playable right out of the box so that is not an issue.  In addition to this, you can race with any car outside of your career mode, so if you just want a quick race with a car you haven't bought in Career mode yet, no problem.  (The locked cars rule still applies though).  Back to the Career mode, every car you buy will appear in your virtual garage, and when you are not racing you can walk around your garage looking at each car you have bought.  Heck they even added coin operated video game machines that you can play in your garage.  No I'm serious, really!  When you garage gets full, you will get a bigger garage that can hold even more cars.\n\nAll of this stuff is in the SINGLE player portion of the game, and I didn't even mention that you can take/save photos and videos of your races, race against your own ghosts, test drive cars you haven't bought in career mode etc.\n\nOnline is almost another game in itself.  Even when a free Silver membership you can race against ghosts from the best drivers around the world and see how you stack up.  Get ranked based on your track times, and even watch real time races of ridiculously good racers on XBOX Live.  And wait, you can download even more cars from XBOX Live!  Some are even free!!  Of course if you have Gold you can actually race against other people online.\n\nIf you like racing games, then what are you waiting for?  At basically HALF the cost compared to other XBOX360 games, this game packs quite a punch.  Definitely worth the money for every thing that is in the game and what you can do right out of the box.  PGR3 is much improved from the original, and I am highly satisfied.  Some people are saying its not as good as PGR2, but for someone that has never played PGR2, PGR3 is light years ahead of PGR1 in EVERY aspect.", "summary": "Great racing title, Bizzare finally got the picture.", "unixReviewTime": 1170806400}

How epic in scope is this?  You're a Crusader who is killed but instead of accepting death, you fight death to be with your wife.  Unfortunately, death already came for your wife and bummer, she's in Hell.  So off you go to fight everything under the sun.\n\nWhile this story is the tale of Dante from Inferno, it definitely reminded me of the sci-fi novel from a few years back called \"Inferno\"&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Inferno/dp/0765316765/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Inferno</a>&nbsp;Great read by the way.  The game has great visuals and sounds given that you're in Hell and the colors are pretty much fire and brimstone.\n\nUnfortunately the game play gets a little bit silly in spots.  Dante is a major butt kicker with his halberd and then his scythe.  He's got some good moves and evidently can jump higher than any normal person can.  Hey, it's a game.  There are a ton of unlockable moves that you can figure out.  Mostly they involve the L2 button.  And the moves vary depending on if you're trying to use your powers for good or to punish.  You can absolve or punish your enemies after you've beaten on them enough.  After a while enemies won't give you as many good/bad points when you absolve them and eventually, you'll just start killing everything.\n\nAction is pretty good. The vista's are impressive.  Unfortunately, the camera is fixed so you can't pan around and really take a look.  There are some times where I really wanted to see more of the background but you're restricted from doing that unless you happen to move Dante to just one spot.  The game locks you in on a path most of the time.  I.e. you can't fall to your death in most places.  But then again, there are other places where you can fall to your death quite easily.  That just makes the game frustrating when out of nowhere, you can die just by moving to the edge when most of the game, you can't die from falling off of the path.  And since you're locked on the path, there is not much to explore.  The game becomes a flow of kill, kill, puzzle, kill, puzzle, repeat.  And most of the puzzles are not too bad but there are a few where you'll want to throw the controller.\n\nThere are major characters through history to find and punish/absolve as well.  That was pretty neat to find some of them and try to figure out what to do.  The story unfolds very slowly and really picks up speed once you're 2/3 of the way through the game.  Basically, you find out that you're not quite as pious as you thought you were.  That part played out well.  Because even though you're the \"good\" guy, you're not really all that good.\n\nThis is a fun game albeit, a very dark concept.  I wish there was more exploration because for the most part, you're locked in on one direction which is down.", "summary": "Epic in scope but still pretty linear", "unixReviewTime": 1266192000}

This is one of the best examples of creating a game with phenominal graphics while still maintaining the classic feel.  I'll try to give you the basic feel of the game without going into too much details or spoiling any surprises.\n\nGameplay: Perfect! Honestly couldn't be better.  There are still just the right amount of glitches to keep the nerds guessing how to get perfect in the level, and also has the same amazing response time as every other Mario game.  Platformers don't get much better than this.  It's a wonder why Nintendo doesn't make a Metroid game like this.  Two new moves are added to this game, [...] stomp and wall jump, both of great use.  Also in this game are two new mushrooms, one that increases your size to fit the screen so you can dominate everything, and one to minimize you to fit into small crevaces and pipes.  Both are rare appearces, but exciting when you get them.  Also new is the ability to have a secondary item, similar to Super Mario World.  All in all, it's an exciting experience.\n\nGraphics: Beautiful.  Engaging worlds, great 2D AND 3D effects, great/smooth framerate, and bright, vivid colors.  There isn't more you could want.  Character models are great, as well as vehicles, mushrooms, and bosses.  One of the best looking DS games to date!\n\nSound: CLASSIC.  Using 3 types of sound, Surrond, Stereo, and Mono, you can choose what type of sound you want to get out of your speakers or headset.  Every crisp and clear and those old tunes never get old.  Very appropriate for each level, and very familiar.\n\nReplay Value: EXCELLENT!!! Especially if you didn't play Super Mario 64 DS.  There are tons of minigames to play if you get tired of playing the regular mode.  But then again, the regular mode is so fun, I don't know how you'd ever get to the minigames.  You can also do vs mode via Wi-Fi hook-up.  There is PLENTY to do in this game, you won't get bored.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: If you own a DS, this is the game you've been waiting for!

That game, much like its successor, received lots of negative exposure because of its \"subject matter content\" and overall violence.  I, like most others who waited patiently for the sequel, plowed through yet more negative publicity; watched RockStar cancel its original release date for the game, and waded through all sorts of internet gossip about what had been done to the content of the game.\n\nManhunt (the original) is a far better game than Manhunt 2--and not becaue its gore factor was untouched.  It was a better game, guys, because it had \"soul.\"  The characters were way more interesting, the writing was better and more creative, and the last stages were absolutely some of the creepiest I've ever encountered!  My personal favorites were the Smileys (a tongue-in-cheek answer to Insane Clown Posse).  I got killed so many times because I was laughing my butt off at some of the lines, e.g. \"passing out before the main course...REALLY;\" \"well, I look divine?  Why, thank you so much; it was just something I threw together;\" and \"My God; they're dropping like flies!\"\n\nIn Manhunt 2, you get NO interesting characters.  Instead, you get caricatures.  It seems two people are involved in some sort of mind-altering experiment; the inmates riot, people escape, others are killed, and you try to retrace your footsteps to see what it all means.  Along the way, you are urinated on, have feces thrown on you, you puke a lot, and you kill a lot.  And that's about it.  The big difference in Manhunt 2, is that even though the killings are much more grotesque than in the first game, you can't see any of them because of what RockStar had to do in order to get the game released.  A \"filter\" has been installed and all you really get in the ability to HEAR what is happening to your victims.  The controls are used differently, which I also didn't care for.\n\nI do not blame RockStar for what it did; it simply did what it had to do in order to sell its product.  I would suggest, however, that if there is a Manhunt 3, you see if you can't create characters that are more memorable; a storyline that is more than just killing; and have a main character your playing audience can feel something for.", "summary": "Confusion Reigns", "unixReviewTime": 1194825600}

I picked up the Double Pack after hearing friends who had PS2's rave about these games for years.  I also read a few reviews that said even though the graphics may be a little out of date, the gameplay remained very compelling.  Well, GTA may have been groundbreaking in its day, but I was less than impressed after making several attemps to wade into these two games.  The graphics, even though they may have been updated a little more for the Xbox, are bad.  Distractingly bad.  The cars look okay, but the buildings in the distance (when you can see them) remind me of the background of a Sega Genesis game.  I am not kidding.  You'll see the same three or four characters repeated over and over again on the street, saying the same things.  The way the people move is also very cartoonish and off-putting.  The control scheme is frustratingly awkward as well.  Whoever translated them over from the PS2 controller to the Xbox's did a horrible job.  The combat system is poorly designed, and the way in which you target and fire guns leaves much to be desired.  Finally, within my first fifteen or twenty minutes of playing the game I noticed two glaring bugs, the first of which was a loss of sound and the second a slowing down of the framerate to a glacial pace.  Both of these occurred in Vice City, for what it's worth.  If you're an Xbox owner and have not played GTA before, I would recommend just renting these games to see if they're for you instead of just buying them on the basis of word of mouth.  The dialogue in the game is pretty funny and driving around the city is fun, but the missions are fairly repetitious and get to be more of a chore than anything else.

Cooper", "reviewText": "After finding a disheartening lack of comparative reviews online I decided that I would write about my own experiences with the above headphones. This review is targeted only at headphones for gaming based on sound from a PS3 slim connected via Monster Ultra Fiber Optic and set to Dolby Digital. I understand there are significantly more options than those I have tested. However, my wish is to give a first-person detailed and reliable account regarding the phones I currently or have previously owned. For a summary of what I found just scroll to the bottom of the review.\n\nAs a sidenote I have watched just about every youtube video, read every gaming website review, and scanned through every forum in my search for audio bliss. This is the cumulation of my knowledge and experiences.\n\nOriginally I had wanted an all in one processor for DTS and Dolby Digital with a simulated surround sound. I watch most movies and play most games at night, and was trying to \"kill a few birds with one stone\" on this one. After round 1 of extensive research I settled on the Sennheiser RS130s. I bought two sets. The sound was pretty good. I could not detect ANY simulated surround, but for watching movies the dialogue was VERY bright and enjoyable. In addition there was no interference with my Wii or PS3 due to the RF and the charging system was a good setup. Unfortunately, the wireless was also the problem. I tried switching through every single channel and resetting the base unit. I consistently got a weird \"modem\" buzzing and clicking sound in the background. Some people might be able to overlook it, but I definitely could not. Back they went and back I went to burning my eyes reading everything online.\n\nRound 2 I decided to bite the bullet, and ordered the Sony MDR-DS7000 headphones from Japan, complete with a second set of phones. They cost me a pretty penny. Once they arrived I tested the voltage coming through the adapter from Japan and found it was much higher than the 9V required for the processor and phones when plugged into a US 120V outlet. After shelling out another $120 for 3 adapters from the Sony MDR-DS6000 series available in the US (courtesy of Sony Style) I was finally able to make sure I hadn't been ripped off from overseas. (The headphones each use 1 adapter to charge the lithium ion batteries. The 3rd is for the Processor.) I was quite satisfied to learn that my bluray, ps3 and wii could all be connected to the same unit. Also, the sound was absolutely crystal clear without a single beep or incoming fax noise. Lord of the Rings sounded great and the VPT surround sound cinema mode made the movie sound like it was being played in a large theatre room. Pretty cool, but not really the \"surround sound\" I had hoped for. Still....it was an improvement from the Sennheisers. And so I proceeded for a few months before deciding that I'd like to get a system more suitable for the PS3. The large hall effect didn't really seem like it was cutting it anymore. So I considered: Should I try ordering the newly improved MDR-DS7100? Hmm...probably not since they just increased the battery life by 3 hours, and increased the drivers from 40mm to 50mm. The surround effect would be the same. I also considered the Pioneer SE-Dir800c once again, but decided against it based on a few factors. The headphones break in nearly 60% of consumer reviews at a swivel point, the batteries (AA) must be charged separately from the unit, the system only has 1 fiber optic input, and additional headphones are only sold in Japan (unless you want to buy a 2nd transmitter as well). It seemed like a lot of trouble, even though I've read almost 2 million times by now that Dolby Headphone technology is vastly superior to Sony's Virtual Phone Technology. And so we come to Round 3: The Tritton Ax Pros.\n\nA long time ago, before my head was filled with all sorts of useless information on headphones, I owned the Tritton AxPros. This was back when people cared less about how they sounded and more about getting sent the wrong set from Amazon or having to look for places to plug in 2 adapters. OMG! 2 adapters! Yeah...I have a surge protector...not a big deal. Back in those times I was very impressed with the quality of the Trittons for 3d mapping in games. Resistance: Fall of Man and other games from way back in the long long ago sounded significantly better when played through the headphones. The only problem was that finding the proper EQ was a pain and my neck felt like I was wearing Rampage Jackson's chains around my neck after playing. After contacting customer service and adjusting the delay to +10, and decreasing the rear speaker and sub (which felt like it would blow out my eardrum on normal) I was satisfied. Looking back I can safely say that my complete satisfaction was, in part, due to my lack of anything to compare sound quality towards. Fast forward to now. After not quite getting the full experience from the Sony headphones, I decided to repurchase the \"newly improved\" Tritton Axpros I had been so fond of. When I got my new set I looked over it for a long time. The AC adapter is definitely \"cheaper\" than both of the older ones (lighter less durable plastic), even though there is now only 1. The break-away cable is a good feature, although you still have to roll it up the same as if you just disconnected it from the decoder box. The microphone has gotten a MUCH needed improvement and is now rubberized/bendable and works a lot better. The headphones still shine a halloween orange glow through the Tritton logo. They also still induce serious headaches from squishing your head like a vice. Funny enough, they actually do not weigh much more than my Sonys. The difference is that Sony has a second band to turn the headphones on that takes most of the pressure off from the top and sides of your head. Tritton has no such feature, but feels much sturdier (like it was carved from a plastic tree). The Tritton also has the individual speaker adjustment, as before, with different colors for different sound levels. This works fine, but a digital +1, +2, +8 numerical readout would be much better. Each color level has 3 or 4 levels before bumping to the next color. Between white and red (medium and max) is \"cyan\" which is the high volume level. This would be fine if you could ACTUALLY TELL a difference from the white. I believe the Cyan simply leaves the white light on while simultaneously turning on the blue. The problem is that the white light completely overpowers everything else. It looks like the volume goes straight from white to red after about 8 clicks. Pretty dumb. Use purple or yellow or a black light. Don't try to combine colors to cut costs Tritton! The newer model also has the feature of being able to turn off the inline controller by holding the \"mute and front speaker\" buttons for a few seconds. Here's the problem with that: 1.)when turning the system back on you're usually holding the mute button so it mutes everything. The way the mute/volume is set up you usually end up also raising the volume as you unmute it. You probably shouldnt have the headphone on when turning the inline controller on anyway since it makes a HUGEEE POP noise when powering on that almost makes your ears bleed. This doesn't even power the unit itself on though. It just powers up the phones. The Dolby decoder box has a completely separate power on button. So.....they took away one AC adapter, but actually made it just as much of a pain in the A*$ to turn on and off. Here's the rub though - when you turn off the main decoder box, it resets your settings. That's right. All of the DRC, Sound Delay (Center and Surround) and master volume settings you pulled out the decoder box to program have all been reset. At first I kept thinking to myself, dang...the game sounds different everytime I turn it back on again...I must have not put the time delay on the right setting. After testing it though...I found the cause. Maybe mine's defective because I don't remember my old unit ever doing this. Must be an \"improvement\" eh? Now for the sound quality.\n\nDiscrete sounds and directions. This is where the Tritton Axpros start to do something right. I switched the fiber optic input from my Sony MDR-DS7000 into the Pros back and forth about 50 times. I tried it with Uncharted 1 + 2, God of War 3, God of War Trilogy, Infamous, Killzone 2, Modern Warfare 1 and 2, Battlefield: BC2 and Bioshock 2. Results were surprising. The AxPros actually blew the Sony's out of the water. In Battlefield, when I swung the knife I could hear it echo in the winter mountains and the fires flickered on different sides as I walked. Riding the vehicles sounded like I was right there. Modern Warfare 1 and Uncharted 1 were actually the most remarkable. In Modern Warfare 1 I could hear the helicopters flying overhead and DIRECTLY pinpoint where they were. I tried about 10 times to close my eyes and see if I could locate a circling helicopter. I was right 9/10 times. The Sony headphones (playing on the dedicated PS3 \"game\" mode) were extremely muffled. Gunshots sounded tiny and shallow. The Trittons just made it seem like I was right there in the environment. In Uncharted I kept restarting the 2nd scene in the jungle and testing the sounds while running through the creeks, in and out of the waterfall, and through the group of birds. With the Trittons it sounded like I was right there. With the Sony's it sounded like I was listening through a set of headphones. Then---slowly---as I listened to Sully talk about finding his \"bride in a brothel\" for the 20th time, I realized I was missing a vital part of the puzzle. Dialogue. Take this into perspective. The Sony's have 2 dedicated 40mm drivers. The Trittons have 8- 30mm drivers. Usually dialogue is only going through 1 set of speakers (center or front) on the Trittons, depending on the game. The driver quality is also considerably lower than the neodymium found in the Sony's. I went back and listened to Modern Warfare 1 and Bioshock 2. Then I listened to dialogue on Infamous and on God of War 3. Holy Jeez! The Trittons were cutting out some of the dialogue or seriously distorting it. This wasn't during key story moments when everything was evenly balanced. Rather, it is when multiple things are going on at once. Funny enough, this is one of the MAJOR things that all the Astro supporters were talking about when discussing potential missteps with multiple drivers. In a helicopter scene on Modern Warfare I could barely make out what people were saying over the radio. On Bioshock 2 the radio feeds were slightly distorted. On Infamous all of the \"S\" sounds in dead drops or phone calls came across like static on a radio. On God of War 3 on the ending fight (as Zeus is floating down towards Gaia's heart) he shouts \"Hmmm....Kratosss...\" in this weird almost comical way. When playing through on the Sonys I could hear it clearly and it always made me laugh after I died for the 50th time. When using the Trittons...I couldn't even hear him say it. I could faintly hear \"Hm....SSS.\" I tried adjusting all of the sound levels individually and could not bring out that line of dialogue. So, after all of my research I started asking myself, would I be missing more dialogue on other games if I stuck with the Trittons? I can't look past the fact that while multiple drivers does = better immersion, it also means less clarity. I also agree with the claim someone else on some distant site said: Sound has a few dead zones on the Trittons. When turning you will clearly notice a sound jump from one speaker to the next. It's not a terrible thing. Some might even like it due to its similarity to real 5.1 setups. But in a video game, if you have that right spot the sound starts to vanish unless you keep turning. I was told that decreasing the surround effect negates this effect, but that comes at the cost of reducing the 3d effect. This is what got me thinking about the Dolby Headphone systems.\n\nI read all about using the Astro Mixamp with other headphones: Beyerdynamic 880s, Sennheiser 555s, 595s, Audio Technica Ath AD700s, AD900s. I wasn't so into researching the Turtle Beach wireless because it uses infrared and has a mic that will not connect to a PS3. If I wanted a standalone infrared processor...I'd just go with the Pioneer SE-DIR800c which are also great for movies even though they'll be duct-taped in about a week due to their fragility. I looked at the JVC dolby processor, but read in a few places it has a small lag between what you see and hear. The Astro Mixamp seems quite good, and a LOT more accessible/user friendly than the AXPROs. Most reviews have stated that the Astro headset is fairly comparable to the Tritton Axpros, so I cannot justify spending an extra $100 for such a slight upgrade. The exposed wire on the Astro set also seems like a bad design flaw. Most websites give the Astros a 9.0 and the AxPros an 8.8. If I truly wanted an upgrade in soudstage and quality, I'd have to purchase an audiophile set of headphones such as those listed above. So that's exactly what I did.\n\nI ordered the Audio Technica ATH-A900 headphones in addition to the Astro dolby mixamp.  After connecting them together I ran extensive tests using all of the same games as before: God of War 3, Uncharted 1 +2, Infamous, Call of Duty MW 1 +2, Killzone 2, and Battlefield BC 2.\nFirst and foremost, the setup was MUCH simpler than the Trittons. The mixamp is powered by AND provides voice chat through the single USB cable. The ATH-A900s are also lightyears ahead of the AXpros in terms of comfort (using a wing stabilizer to decrease weight). They are VERY large, but since they are closed they keep sound in/out very well. I would say about the same as the Sony MDR-DS7000 headphones, and considerably better than the Trittons. If this isn't an issue for your household I would recommend the AD series since an open sound is slightly better for soundstage. The mixamp uses a Dolby headphone type 2 configuration preset which is not user adjustable. You get one surround/delay effect. Depending on your view this can be a pro or a con. On the one side, you simply plug in your headphones and start up your game. On the flip side, those who enjoy tweaking surround levels and speaker volumes will be discouraged. Personally I enjoy having everything tweaked to standardized optimal settings. For all of the long hours I spent adjusting the Trittons I still never locked onto what I found to be a \"perfect\" setting. Voice chat is also MUCH easier to control with the single balance knob of the Astro Mixamp. The only problem is that without an inline volume control you will have to find your optimal volume level before sitting down to enjoy whatever game you are playing. The mixamp is \"smarter\" than the Tritton Dolby box in that it turns itself off whenever the headphones are unplugged. In addition if you have it powered via USB it will turn off whenever the USB power is turned off (in my case the PS3), even though you will have to manually turn it back on. The portability of the mixamp may also factor into your decision since it can be powered via batteries, although this did not affect my review. The first thing I noticed when playing Call of Duty was that dialogue was very bright and crisp. It was SUBSTANTIALLY better than the AXPROs, and marginally better than the Sonys. I would actually say it was most comparable to the dialogue from the Sennheisers I first owned, although lacking the annoying extraneous noises. Without the Dolby Headphone mode it sounds exactly like what you would expect: sound through a pair of quality 2 speaker headphones. However, with DH turned on the game gives you a very enjoyable out-of-head surround that easily surpasses the VPT of the Sony Headphones. I will not lie though. The 3d effect is definitely subpar compared to the effect of the Trittons. In Call of Duty I could no longer pinpoint circling helicopters. In Uncharted I could no longer hear strangle ambient jungle sounds as if they were all around me. HOWEVER, (and this is the most important part of this review) sounds were distinctly more REALISTIC. It seems like a strange trade-off. In Battlefield BC 2 crackling fires and vehicles no longer sounded like they were in-my-face with the Audio Technicas. Instead they sounded like a normal fire crackling on the ground. In short, it no longer seemed like sounds were being \"forced\" into specific positions coming into my ears. This is no easy task to convey. The Sony headphones failed to convey the spatial quality of games in an accurate setting. The Trittons created a very pleasing 3d effect but with diminishing realism for voice and sounds. The Astro mixamp/audio technica setup slightly decreases the 3d effect but sounds EXACTLY like what I believe the sound engineers recorded. Ultimately the preference is yours. For games like Infamous the Astro/Technica setup blows everything else out of the water. Not only was dialogue extremely clear, but the entire soundstage sounded realistically recreated for the city environment. With the Trittons certain aspects were enjoyable (fountains, passing cars), while others were abysmal (scuttling trash monsters, yelling fans, distant gunshots). Using the Audio Technica headphones I can hear every single detail I was missing with the Sony headphones, but also enjoy ultra realistic sound for everything else in-game. Rear noise is easier to pinpoint with the Trittons, but I still get the same feeling of \"being there\" with the Audio Technicas. From a trade-off perspective I would say that the Astro/Audio Technica setup definitely takes the crown. I can put fifteen mini-speakers around my head and pinpoint EXACTLY where a crackling fire or babbling brook is located. Yet if the speakers aren't great, will the sound QUALITY make it sound exactly like what a brook or fire should sound like? Instead it sounds like a precisely located yet slightly unrealistic sound reproduction. This is my best analysis of the Trittons vs ATH A900s. The A900s sound like \"real water, or real fire.\" The trade-off is yours to decide between.\n\nEither way, The Trittons or Astro/Audio-Technica setup is still better than the Sony MDR-DS7000s for gaming. Your preference will determine what is the best fit for your style of gaming. Based on my experieces I would say that since the new Tritton AX700 utilizes the same technology as the Astro set, it would be moot to compare similar technologies. If you enjoy the Dolby Headphone processing of the mixamp, then it would be wise to get the astros based on the extent of other relevant gaming features. If you desire an alternative surround experience, then go with a multi-speaker headphone setup.\n\nIN SUMMATION:\n\nSony MDR-DS7000:\n(+) Crystal Clear Static Free Wireless, Decodes Dolby and DTS, Multiple Fiber Optic Inputs, Long Battery Life, Very good for movies, Clear Dialogue, Can be used with a combination of analog and digital inputs\n(- ) No microphone input for voice chat, Poor spatial mapping for gaming, VPT is a poor surround sound simulator, VERY costly to import from Japan, Needs alternative power supply or universal adapter\n\nDialogue: 8/10\nEffects: 6/10\nAmbient: 5/10\n3d Mapping:4/10\n\nTritton AXPRO:\n(+) BEST 3d mapping, Good integration of voice and in game volume, In-line volume adjustment, Very User Adjustable Sound Levels across all fields (speaker volume, delay setting, DRC), Good Immersion and Ambient Sounds, BEST VALUE for surround experience\n(-) Most UNCOMFORTABLE of headphones tested, Tendency to distort or unrealistically convey dialogue and certain sounds, Most complicated to setup and fine tune to enjoyable settings, Poor on/off integration based on power being separated into decoder box and inline controller, Closed headphone design with open headphone sound leakage\n\nDialogue:6/10\nEffects:7/10\nAmbient:10/10\n3d Mapping:9/10\n\nAstro Mixamp w/ Audio Technica ATH-A900\n(+) MOST REALISTIC sounds of all headphones, EXTREMELY Precise dialogue and sound effects, Very good out-of head 3d simulation based on Dolby Headphone technology, Integration of voice-chat and power source through single USB cable, Extremely simple interface, Highest level of connectivity and portability for competitive gamers or LAN parties, Most comfortable of headphones tested\n(-) Not quite as good Rear Surround as Trittons, Less Ambient effect heard in background\n\nDialogue:10/10\nEffects:9/10\nAmbient:8/10\n3d Mapping:7/10\n\nPersonally, I prefer the Astro/Audio Technica combination above the others. It is probably the most enjoyable surround experience I have had when playing a videogame through headphones. As such, if you do a LOT of voice chat and online play then I would probably suggest purchasing the complete Astro setup for the use of their headset microphone (which from what I have read is stellar). If you care less for voice chat than detailed immersion (but cost is a factor) then go with the ATH-A700s and Astro Mixamp. If you prefer extreme 3d mapping and may or may not be on a budget, go with the Trittons. If you hate wires, then go wireless with Turtle beach or the Sonys from above. If you are like me and play most games without voice chat and demand high quality crisp dialogue and effects then go with the Astro/ATH900 setup.\n\nHope all of the time I spent writing this helps you decide what is most important to you", "summary": "DETAILED COMPARISON: Tritton AXPRO, Sony MDR-DS7000 + Audio Technica ATH-A900 w/ Astro Mixamp", "unixReviewTime": 1273190400}

A bit of research to know what you were buying would have saved you the trouble and would have saved this EXCELLENT adventure game from bad scores it doesn't deserve. As an adventure game, Rabbids Go Home is completely original. I've never heard of a game where you build a huge junk pile to get to the moon and thus go home. Or anything even close to that plotline. And you get there in the most crazed, fun, weird and wonderful ways you can hope for. One similarity there IS to the previous titles is the humor. The writing is once again clever and witty, with a lot of \"What the....? YES!!!!!!!!\" moments. The Rabbids are manic as usual, thank goodness! I've always thought their zaniness was the best part of the mini games. The game looks great too, they are really squeezing the Wii for all the graphical juice they can get out of it. The controls are much improved over previous Rabbids games, things are very fine tuned now and feels much more natural.

You can't beat the amazon price of $32.99 for 2 game of the year titles!  Both go for $29.99 individually.\n\nBioshock is a twisted first person shooter that takes you to the depth of the water where a city was built called rapture.  Parents beware this game is pretty demonic and sick!  I would definitely recommend at least 17 years or older to play.  Lots of dead or undead creatures lurking around with sedistic tendencies.  You can harvest or rescue little girls and as you play you unravel the mysteries of the city rapture.  I have yet to finish the game but im half way through and it's safe to say i will be buying the sequel bioshock 2 when it releases.  The storyline to this game is amazing!  I swear it will have you hooked for a few days straight on some 8 hour gaming sessions.  The graphics are well detailed and the theme takes a kind of old fashioned look to it (hard to describe but reminds me of old movies back in the day) like a 1940's look.  This game is not short by any means so if you rent it, you better give take some days off from work because a couple hours here and there will take you past your rental lease hahaha.  Also, there is a free dlc on xbox live for this game.\n\noblivion is a beautifully rendered fantasy type of game.  not like the traditional rpg's where you push a button to fight or push this button to cast a spell and then you watch a cutscene do the work.  it's like a first person shooter if you will...if you loved fable, fable 2 or even mass effect you will definitely love this game!  there is tons of dlc's for this game via xbox live.  again, i haven't finished this game yet but the graphics and visuals are breathtaking, the load times are quite long but there was so much depth put into this game that it makes it understandable and tolerable.  The character creation in this game is by far amongst the most specific and detailed ive come across! there is tons of different routes you can take through out the game through side quests and the main story mode helping evolve your character into whatever you dreamt it to be.  many different skills to level up through and character traits to build on but as you upgrade the cpu's upgrade as well so you won't just be dominating entirely through out the game.\n\ni know i didn't get way in depth on the review but i figure if you want the best reviews on each game look at the reviews on each game separately but trust me this is the best bang for your buck on two game of the year titles...just look at the picture!  both combined won over 80 game of the year awards.", "summary": "Together At LAST!", "unixReviewTime": 1247875200}

Well, it does have some fairly organized non-combat gameplay mechanics including a built-in computerized buying and selling system that acts like EBAY for custom crafters. I also got a kick out of the ability to purchase harvesters which dig up incredible amounts of resources on all planets while your character levels up somewhere else.  I enjoyed tinkering around with some of SWG's non-combat options but that was really the only thing I found to do in the game.  At the time I played, there wasn't a single Jedi in the game but I hear that people are finally discovering (after almost a year of play!) how to become one.  I also hear that in the future, the game might add space combat and land vehicles which were a critical omission from the original game which leads me to my number one complaint, how can you create an MMORPG about Star Wars and leave out space?  That's like creating a Dungeons & Dragons MMORPG and leaving out magic. I'd like to spend more time telling you some of the pros and cons of this game but it bored me to death after two weeks of play.  And this is coming from someone that spent months on previous MMORPG classics. It doesn't offer the MMORPG gamer anything they haven't seen before and it probably has one of the most boring hack and slash leveling systems of all the MMORPG titles.  SWG still has a strong fan base and I'd recommend that Star Wars fans, diehard MMORPG fans (you know who you are), and MMORPG newbies give it the old college try but everyone else should save their money.  This game might be fantastic after three or four expansions which you know are coming considering it has the same developer that worked on Everquest, but it doesn't bring anything new to the quickly diminishing MMORPG genre which is imploding from its own repetitiveness.", "summary": "Only Recommended for Star Wars Faithful or MMORPG Diehards", "unixReviewTime": 1073606400}

Gone were the traditional top-down viewpoints, the 1-dimensional characters, and the boring spell effects, and we watched in amazement at hitherto-unparalleled graphics and a completely revolutionary storyline showed us exactly how good a RPG could be. Winning legions of new fans over to the genre, FF 7 fully deserved it's blockbusting, best-selling status.\nFF 7 follows the story of Cloud Strife, a young mercenary-for-hire, and his attempts to stop his ex-colleague and nemesis Sephiroth from destroying the world. Along the way he meets some memorable characters, makes friends and discovers who he truly is.\nThe strongest selling point of FF 7 at the time of it's release was the graphics, which today, understandably, have been surpassed several times over. However, some moments in the game still hold their own against the modern consoles, and for a seven year-old game, that's no small feat. What remains today is one of the best storylines ever, coupled with some of the smoothest game mechanics in videogaming history.\nThe emotion behind the characters of Aeris, Cloud, Sephiroth etc., is something which games developers have only recently started to latch on to - for example, 'Silent Hill 2' and 'Fatal Frame' go deep into the psychology of emotion - but in a character and story-driven game like FF 7, the depth of attachment we form with the characters is simply amazing. It's impossible to treat FF 7 as a piece of retro-gaming, such is the depth of development behind the storyline. It tackles subjects like political upheaval, religion, self-worth - and does it all in such a way as to force us to mentally attach ourselves to the little people running about on the screen.\nThe gameplay, too, is superb, with an easy menu system and full in-game tutorials being accessible at pretty much any point in the game. The difficulty level is pitched exactly right, there's a steady learning curve and monsters and battles become significantly harder as you progress, but not so hard as to be prohibitive. Puzzles and secrets abound, and each time you play (and you WILL play it multiple times) you discover several new features that you didn't see before. With typical Square finnesse, the game options are customisable so battles and cut-scenes don;t have to take up too much time, and the whole game moves at a speed which you, the player, dictate.\nI can't rave enough. Possibly equalled in terms of absorbing entertainment only by it's own sequels, FF 7 is still a rewarding, hugely entertaining, and very special game. Totally recommended.", "summary": "The Best", "unixReviewTime": 1075507200}

It seems that every time Nintendo releases a new episode in the series, it hits video gaming gold.  From the earliest release of the original \"Super Mario Brothers\" on the original Nintendo Entertainment System, it has always been a hit.  Even lesser known titles in the series, like \"Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island\", stay faithful to the series and produce very entertaining gameplay.  With the dawn of Nintendo's three dimensional, 360 degree rotating platform, Nintendo 64, the question became, \"Could Nintendo maximize the potential of this new platform and give Mario a fresh angle?\"  The answer, in the form of \"Super Mario 64\", proved to be a quite emphatic \"YES!\"\n\n\"Super Mario 64\" takes the technique of 'multiple goals' for each level (introduced in \"Super Mario World\") and expands it in a quite impressive manner.  There are 15 worlds Mario must navigate in an effort to free the Princess who is trapped in paintings in her castle.  The goal is to accumulate at least 70 stars to unlock the passage way the final battle with Bowser.  As each world contains 7 stars of its own in addition to 15 bonus stars around the castle, it would seem to be a walk in the park.  However, all is not as it seems.  Several of the doors leading the different worlds are sealed off either by locks or star requirements.  Therefore, there is a limited amount of ways to accumulate the necessary stars until more stars are attained or earlier battles with Bowser are won.  Of course, this leads to a journey through amazing worlds were Mario travels the depths of the ocean, soars in the open sky, battles over scorching lava, and even gets to sneak through a haunted house.  The variety of worlds and objectives are truly amazing, as are the new moves Mario can make to help accomplish these goals.  No longer content to just move forward and jump, Mario can now do backflips, long jumps, wall leaps, and crawls.\n\nOne other aspect of \"Super Mario 64\" that makes it standout is its use of rotating camera angles to track Mario's movements through each world.  It takes some getting used to, but it enables a truly three dimensional feel.  This is game that Nintendo built its release of Nintendo 64 around.

Yes.\n\nIs this Paper Mario? No.\n\nI didn't let what some folks were saying deter me from picking this up. In case you haven't heard, in Paper Mario: Sticker Star, Mario no longer receives exp from enemies he defeats, and thus he no longer levels up (although his maximum HP can be raised by finding hearts within the game). What people don't seem to realize, is that Nintendo didn't just simply remove features from their newest Paper Mario game but they replaced them too.\n\nIn case you couldn't tell from the title, this game has to do with Stickers. Stickers are the source of Mario's power in this game. A sticker can be many things. You'll find jump shoes, fire flowers, POW blocks, mushrooms, and many other staples from Mario games. Each one does something different when used in battle. Once a sticker is used, it disappears for good. But don't worry, stickers can be found over and over again by revisiting areas. The really good ones can be purchased from shops using coins won from battles and found in the various levels of the game. Mario himself may not level up, but he can sometimes find \"shiny\" versions of stickers. These versions are stronger than their un-shiny counterparts. For instance, a \"shiny fire flower\" will do more damage than a \"fire flower.\"\n\nStickers aren't just for battle either. Sometimes Mario can interact with his environment by grabbing/placing stickers. If a door is on a building crooked, Mario can pull it off and place it on correctly/ If a bad guy steals a bridge, it's up to Mario to get it back before he can cross. There are plenty of small surprises too if you really keep your eyes open :)\n\nThe game has an over-world map. I was pleasantly surprised to see the game treat the different areas as though they were levels in a Mario world. You'll visit 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, etc. It helps the game feel like a traditional Mario game while it remains an RPG at its core. Areas are extremely colorful and alive and are explored in the usual Paper Mario fashion. The 3D effect only enhances the experience. It's also neat that so much in the game is one huge play on being paper.\n\nMusic is catchy. I recently played Mario 3D Land, which also has really good music. I just wish Nintendo would give The New Super Mario Bros. series this kind of attention.\n\nYou can have three save files per game card. I was personally very glad to see this as my girlfriend quickly expressed her interest in the game. Rather than being forced to spend another $40 on a separate copy, she can just use her very own save file right on the same game card.\n\nSo far, my only gripe with the game is that the A button is both \"jump\" and \"examine.\" I don't understand why on a system with so many buttons, Nintendo felt the need to make one button have multiple functions. While it might not happen often, it's annoying when you want Mario to jump, but he instead interacts with something close to him.\n\nIf you're an open minded person, I am confident you will enjoy this game. If you hate change, however, then you'd probably better take your $40 elsewhere.", "summary": "A very well polished adventure", "unixReviewTime": 1352764800}

The artwork, storylines, and RPG gameplay has invariably hooked me, whether the game was on the Playstation, Nintendo consoles, or through the computer. Thus, when the opportunity to purchase the Collectors Edition of this newest title, I jumped at the chance. More Final Fantasy gameplay? Yes please!\n\nAfter playing the game today, I must say that the style, combat, and story of Final Fantasy Type-0 has left me in my usual giddy place. After my frustration with Final Fantasy XIII, I was worried that this new title would be tedious, annoying, and confusing. So, without further ado, here is my analysis of Final Fantasy Type-0 HD for the Playstation 4.\n\nGraphics & Sound\n\nIf there is a flaw in this title, it would be with the graphics. While the gameplay and cinematics are uniform and indecipherable from one another, the fact that this game is supposed to be an HD upgrade resulted in my hopes for the game falling short. Compared to the vibrant and detailed world of the recently released game 1886, Final Fantasy Type-0 HD (FFT0 for short) looks like a Playstation 3 title with some smoothing around the edges. Fingers look squared, with details such as fingernails and wrinkles about the knuckles being reminiscent of the abs that were drawn on Van in Final Fantasy XII. The hair of each character is blocky, skin texture looks like all of the characters are airbrushed models, and the clothing on the characters are as stiff as to look like an entire can of starch was used on each outfit. To add insult to injury, the mouth movements of each character are unnatural, even forgiving that they are synced to match Japanese speech (which is a normal gripe for previous Final Fantasy titles, too). Granted this is a sprucing up of a PSP title, but it would be nice if some of the textures and other aspects of the graphics were overhauled more thoroughly.\n\nThese issues aside, the world of FFT0 is for the most part gorgeous, although it would be nice if there were not so many restrictions on exploration. Invisible walls dot the landscape, and each Mission can sometimes feel very linear. Fortunately the action in this title is fast-paced, and your characters run quickly enough that even longer distances are not a huge issue. The camera is also one of the better ones that I have seen used in a title; it responds to input very well, stopping on a dime when you release the right analog stick. It is fluid enough to follow your actions, with few situations resulting in a surprise ganking. This is a very welcome aspect, especially when you factor in the frenetic pace of combat within FFT0.\n\nVoiceacting within FFT0 is also top-notch, even though the lip movements of the characters are somewhat stiff and don't match up with the English vocalization. Characters all sound distinct and have a host of grunts and groans, sometimes so much so that a porn star would feel jealous! Even standard encounters have voiceacting, although it is repetitive (if I hear Use all your ammo! one more time, I will throw my controller). The soundtrack for the game is masterful, as are all Final Fantasy titles, with the beautiful compositions of Takeharu Ishimoto. Sound effects are also great, adding a subtle touch to the game that helps to bring the world of FFT0 to life.\n\nGameplay\n\nThis is where Final Fantasy Type-O excels. I truly hated the combat system in Final Fantasy XIII, which was cumbersome and took way too long to kill enemies. FFT0 has developed a fluid system that functions in real time, enabling the player to dodge attacks and move about the field freely (although each fight has a set area, defined with those invisible walls again). This aspect of the game is crucial, as enemies will chase you and do their utmost to kill you. Fortunately, your characters engage in combat with the same speed as the enemies, with a fast-paced fighting style. Essentially your character can fight/dodge/run about the battle field freely, giving you the freedom necessary to dodge attacks and to issue your own. Attacks/defensive capabilities are mapped to the buttons of the controller, giving you a single-push action (which can be customized within the menu). After a few fights you will be zipping about the screen quickly, executing attacks with ease. This is where the strategy comes in: every enemy in the game has a random period of time where an attack can do excessive damage (a yellow target) or flat-out kill it (a red target). No matter the attack that you execute, if it connects with the baddie when either of these bonus damage timeframes appears, you will reap the rewards. This adds a bit of a challenge to each battle; mastering the timing to attack during these windows, all while avoiding death yourself, adds a lot of flair to combat.\n\nFinally, you have the option of controlling whomever you wish in this game, so you can alter the party lead to suit your playing style. Adjusting to new characters is somewhat critical, as the game has a tendency to ramp up the difficulty with little warning. Thus, being flexible and maintaining your partys stats is a necessity. As you move about the world and encounter more enemies, thinking on your feet and adjusting your combat becomes crucial to advancement. Just spamming the attack button will not always work. In the same vein, you will find that you may have better luck with a mission should you change up your party, as each character has their own set of strengths and weaknesses. Ultimately, you will find yourself spending a lot of time maximizing and Promoting your team.\n\nFinal Say\n\nIf you never got around to playing Final Fantasy Type-0 on the PSP, or are chomping at the bit for a title to hold you over until Final Fantasy XV is released, this rehash will fit the bill. With the exceptions of some of the finer details of the graphics, the breathy voiceacting that sounds like a bad porno, and some of the frustrations with the difficulty bouncing around, this is a solid title and definitely one that should be part of your Final Fantasy collection. Sure, the story is a bit clich (one kingdom invades the others, incites war, wants the power of the crystals sounds like Germany during WWII, only with a lot more dragons and magic), but perfecting combat and getting the best gear for your party is only part of the fun that adds a lot of replay value to this title. So sit back, bounce around the screen, and have fun Final Fantasy XV is still months away, so kill your time with this game! Definitely a solid 4 out of 5 stars.", "summary": "Lots of Fun & Challenge in a Solid Title", "unixReviewTime": 1426550400}

It gets really old racing against the same few models, and unlike the previous games, you never need to buy a second car. The gains from doing so are so tiny it's best to stick with whatever you got at the start. This game is much shorter as a result, since there is a lot less room for working your way up. It is devoid of the joy of getting that next car you've been saving up for. Another annoying thing about the vehicle collection is that some of the old favorites, such as the AE86 are no longer customizable. You get a \"custom\" version that you can't modify. Not even performance-wise, which makes them useless. The races are also WAY too easy. The AI's never take turns or even gradual bends at speed. Learn to corner and you've already beaten the game.

None of the games had download codes, so at least it appears with latest compilations being sold (of course that may depend on the seller), they are all on disk.  With that being said though, each game does take a bit of time to install from the disk, especially FC3.  I always tend to be a bit behind on games I want to play, mainly because I usually wait for the prices to go down from the usual starting price and the lack of time I have to play.  Because of that I sometimes miss some of the ones I want to play and the Far Cry series is one of those, but when I saw this compilation recently go on sale during the holidays for 12 dollars for the 3 games on PS3, I bought it.  I figured that if I didn't like it so much, it wasn't a big investment per game, plus it gives me a chance to decide if I like the series enough to get the new Far Cry games later on that are out on PS4.\n\nGranted these games have been reviewed individually since they have been out a while, but since I am new to them, I will give my initial impressions to each.\n\nFC2 is probably my least favorite of the three games due to some of the limitations in gameplay but considering this game is around 7 years old, it still has some things going for it that makes it fun to play.  The graphics are decent considering the games age, although it would have been nice if they had released a remastered version with updated graphics.  The sounds in the world are realistic from the wild animals in the jungle, to the crunch of the brush and even to the crusty old jeep you drive.  The story line is decent and interesting enough to make me feel involved in the outcome.  I am only about 20 percent in but there seems to be a lot of missions and things to do, although I will say some of the missions are a bit repetitive and at every guard post it seems you get attacked.  Sometimes it is hard to see enemies as well when they seem to be able to hit you much easier than you can them.  The whole malaria thing to me is a bit annoying but it does add a different element to the game.  I also think the driving with the GPS and using the map while walking is not as intuitive as I would like and a bit distracting, but it could also be because I have been use to different styles of gameplay from other games and it is taking me time to adjust.  There are a few issues I have found as well such as a guy shooting a different direction and I still get hit.  There is some variety in the weapons and upgrades but limitations with carrying them and ammo.  I am also not crazy about the save in certain spots limitation the game has on the PS3 as well.  As a game on its own, I am not sure I would have made a solo purchase but as part of this 3 game package, this is a decent enough to make me feel like I got my moneys worth.\n\nAs it is expected with sequels (especially one that has nearly 4 years since the previous FC2), FC3 is sleeker and sharper with its graphics with a large environment that has many more things to do than FC2.  In addition to the missions, there are the added elements of hunting and making things in the game.  Although I am not quite as far into FC3 as I would like to be, mainly because I want to finish up FC2 before I move onto to the next, I have so far enjoyed this game enough to make this purchase worth it for this game on its own.  The graphics and sounds within the game are good and much improved over the previous FC.  The story for me is interesting enough to get me involved right away with the game opening with you stuck in a cage trying to make a dramatic get away.  The missions seem at least to me from the onset seemed to be more focused and directed but not so much that it detracts from the open feel.  There is a really nice balance of stealth and combat here that gives some variety in how to approach a mission.  There are a few minor issues that I have come across but they are not enough to make me stop playing.\n\nBlood dragon is something a little different than what I have come to expect in the series but with being different with its tongue and cheek sci-fi approach.  Since I am working on finishing the first two games, I have played this the least but the game play seems to be pretty similar to FC3.  Considering this was DLC originally this is pretty good game overall, but as with most DLC it is not as deep with as much gameplay as the FC3 main game.  As part of the 3 game package though, this makes a nice diversion to play once I finish the first two games.\n\nOverall, for a 3 game compilation at less than 20 bucks, then this is worth it, especially if you are like me and missed playing all of the games in the series when they first came out.\n\n4 stars", "summary": "Good compilation", "unixReviewTime": 1450915200}

Carpenter", "reviewText": "I own the new Warcraft III series from Blizzard, and other true 3D games like Emperor: Battle for Dune, from Westwood/EA games.  I say this because some of the older RTS games like Westwood's Command and Conquer series, Dune 2000, Blizzards own Warcraft II, and other games date badly.  You can see this in terms of the control problems, blocky graphics, clunky path finding, and (if you play online) nearly non-existent fan base.\nStarcraft and the expansion Broodwar, still generate a daily complement of 40000 players, online at any one time, playing in thousands of games. I'm sure the newest games like Warcraft III, and Diablo II is providing the lions share of overall traffic on Blizzards server farms.  Still, Starcraft is a game going on six years of relatively strong viability. The reasons why are simple.\nFirst, the game has nearly flawless control.  This is significant, since many computer users, only work with a mouse and keyboard. Second, as an RTS (real time strategy game), the game has been patched, to keep up a finely tuned balance between forces. Due to strong after purchase support, the smallest bugs, have been rooted out of the game in subsequent, game patches. Third, the game has \"mucho\" replayability! I've played single missions over, and over, just to try the different strategies. The diversity of units is done so well, that many strategies exist in multi-player as well. Fourth, due to the easy to work game editor, there are many different games, produced by the players.  Some are just battle, and others are detailed RPG style games, while still others, reinvent the term: \"All Out War\".\nBlizzard has a different philosophy than most gaming companies. They continue to work on a game until they believe it is a first class product. They provide added value like a game editor that you can use to create better missions than the professional ones created in the game.  Not to mention, the server network Battle Net, that allows game owners with simple Internet connections to login, and play online with up to 8 players, for no additional charge!  Yes that's right Ultima and Everquest players, it's still totally free to play online!\nThe last thing to consider is the original Starcraft, and its expansion set Broodwar, are an incredible bargain, at less than twenty bucks for both.  Add to that that, they throw in both of the expensive guide books, and game newbies can start playing for dirt.  Moreover, just between you, me, and the lamppost, deep down in some secret cavern, inside Blizzards game complex they are working on Starcraft II.  If you have the stamina, (or the cheat codes) to beat Warcraft III on its highest setting, and last mission, you get an extended ending sequence.  The extension, shows a brief detail of 3D Starcraft characters, in a short battle sequence.\nBlizzard has not announced this game officially, and refuses to confirm or deny they will produce it.  I believe this all has to do with, continued sales of Starcraft as it exists today.  A game with a strong following, and decent enough sales to give them time to create a 3D follow-up, that won't disappoint. Warcraft II had a lot of AI, and path finding problems that Starcraft does not have. Warcraft III was necessary to revive that series.  Starcraft does not have those problems, so the challenge will be to make a new game, that is much richer, and more interesting in its game play.  Until that time comes, you won't be disappointed playing the original.", "summary": "This 1998 RTS game is still one of the best out there!!", "unixReviewTime": 1070150400}

Gaming mice I find have more of the customizable features and extra buttons that are so useful for me in my work.\n\nThe cyborg mouse is definitely one of the coolest looking mice. If a Borg used a mouse, this is what it would look like. Definitely an eye-catcher. The feel reminds me very much of the G9. Like that mouse, I find that my hand does tend to cramp up with extended use...I prefer a larger mouse that shapes to your hand more ergonomically for long-term use. But otherwise, this mouse sure has a lot of stuff you can adjust. I particularly like being able to easily adjust the weight of the mouse, having some heft to it really helps with precise mousing.\n\nThe biggest disappointment for me was the included software. You can assign a variety of keystrokes, etc. but where are some of the basic mouse/windows actions? The biggest issue I had is that I can't seem to get the side scroll button to actually do side scrolling! This was the main reason I picked up this mouse, I expected to be able to be able to customize that extra scroller to do left-right scrolling, but have yet to figure out how to accomplish this. If it *is* possible, it sure isn't very intuitive. Until I can figure out how to do this, I'll stick with other mice I have where this is an option that I have.", "summary": "Not as customizable as I expected", "unixReviewTime": 1289952000}
