I've come to realise that the benefits for a slightly longer life barely makes sense given the much higher price you have to pay for it.  Eventually, all strings corrode and lose their lustre and if you are a professional playing gigs, you change your strings so often anyway that to pay much more for polycoating doesn't make any sense.  If you are the kind that occasionally takes out the axe then maybe this would make a difference but what I do is I get the least expensive ones and make sure I wipe down and clean them, even using products like string cleaners and Fast Fret to reduce finger squeak if necessary and my strings last for quite some time as well except at a much lower cost.\n\nFew people know this but only a few guitar stringmakers exist in the U.S. and many of them that are retailed are actually the same strings with different brand names.  Granted Elixir probably isn't one of these as they try to make hay with the time they have left on their patent of this polycoating technology but my thing is why pay so much more for strings when the benefit you get is really not so substantial as to justify the price?  I myself use generic Kyser stings for my classical and acoustic guitars and Memphis Electrics for my electric just because they are the cheapest I could find on the web and my sound has not been detrimentally affected in any way.  In fact, you are much more likely to improve upon your sound by using better amps and guitar cables than you are with strings; at least most people would be able to hear the difference.  Don't get me wrong these Elixir strings are not bad but you are much more likely to get a better sound by improving your technique (practice), getting better cables, pickups, amps, guitars etc than from just using these strings.  For better string life, just wipe down and clean the strings before and after use.

Sound recording and editing is a hobby of mine, and in particular I am drawn to condenser microphones. I also am a pastor who has set up our current sound system at church, and I was wanting a microphone that was low profile, but was sensitive for those who are harder of hearing.\n\nAt first I wanted to find a large condenser microphone designed for more vocal work than instrumental. But the pulpit doesn't have a lot of room and none of the large diaphragm condenser microphones I was finding were low profile enough. So I took a chance with this one, realizing that it's more designed for picking up acoustic instruments, but hoping it would be passable for voice.\n\nUsing the cardioid capsule, this is more than just passable for voice. It's fantastic. All of my expectations for this microphone were far exceeded, and the best part about it is it's at a price point that won't break the bank. It's lower profile helps it blend into the pulpit so that it's not a distraction.\n\nThis is just an all around good microphone. Yes, it's mostly for instruments, but don't overlook it if you're looking for a low profile vocal microphone.

I was really surprised at how reasonable the price was for such a specialized product so I ordered it.\n\nWhen it arrived I was even more impressed with it in person.  It has a VERY solid feel to it and even though it has a different shape than any other harmonica that I have ever held before it fit in my hands perfectly.

This should be a great choice for the folk, country and gospel harp player.  Since there are no screws on the exterior of the harmonica I have no idea how you would open it up to repair or replace the reed plates but since they sell them I am certain that it can be done.\n\nI have always stuck to Hohner harmonicas and I still like them a lot.  However, I am so impressed with this product that I am going to add Suzuki harmonicas to my list of cool harps that I really want.  I am sure that I will be buying more soon!\n\nUpdate: 6/17/12  I have been playing around with this harp and have found that if you cover one end and blow in the other it will play all of the notes--both on the draw and the blow--and if you cover the holes with your fingers it is kind of like a backwards flute.

But, rather than rate the stars on that aspect, I'm rating based on the quality of the actual product.\n\nIt's a well constructed gig bag.  It's got padding, a side pocket and good zipper. It's a little overpriced, but it does have a couple things about it that stand-out.\n\nThe first is the plush interior fabric.  I have no worries putting an expensive guitar in there.  Most gig bags have nylon inside, which is ok, but I wouldn't want to put any nice guitars in them.  It also has a plush fabric flap that rests between the back-end of the guitar and the zipper, so there are no worries standing the bag on end.  Nice!\n\nLike others, this also has shoulder-straps so you can wear it like a back-pack.  Something I never do.  But this bag keeps them hidden so they don't flop about, and in the process, adds a little more padding.\n\nIf you need a nice gig bag, give it a look.", "summary": "It's a Gig Bag, it's Good.

Also, those cymbal separators inside are very flimsy and I had to immediately insert my own that were stiffer so they don't slip down to the bottom of the bag (where the supplied flimsy inserts now reside). So my final review is this: After doing my own handiwork to beef things up, the bag itself is surely secure enough and design wise its a beauty but in real world usage it's not built to last.

Once there, it takes several turns of the tuning knob to stretch the string into tune, so there's no danger of it popping out once in place.  I believe it is well worth the effort.

I can say the same thing about most fuzz pedals though. This is not a wooly, splattery vintage tone like the Dunlop Fuzz Face.  It really has it's own thing going on. You can also run an overdrive or boost into this pedal to push it even harder and it sounds like Cherub Rock.  Back when I purchased this pedal I'd read that this version of the pedal was redesigned by Fran Blanche (from Frantone pedals) back when she worked for EH.  I don't know whether or not the current production models have been modified from that circuit. It's not the kind of pedal that I keep on all the time, but it's a cool tool for the sonic toolbox.

The tube tone emulator really gives you that warm overdriven tube tone.\n\nSpectracomp multi string compression (not sure what that means in technical terms). Basically it has built-in compression which sounds great.\n\nHeadphone jack AND the ability to plug in an mp3 player or phone. This is one of the primary reasons I wanted this. Great for late night practices. Note the mp3 player will only play through the headphones.\n\nSize, nice and light and it looks cool with all the lights. You can easily store three different settings which is great for those of us who have multiple basses.\nAlso a built in tuner and you can get a footswitch (The manufacturer price for the footswitch is ridiculous but I got one off eBay for $45).\n\nCONS:\nOnly one speaker out, that is a big one for me and the main reason I will likely only use this as a practice amp.\n\n4 oms, another big negative for me as my GK cabs are all 8.\n\nNo effects loop.\n\nThere is a lot of talk online that this is no where near the stated 450 watts. I will leave that to others with the technical expertise to discuss.\n\nAll these negatives are right there in the specs so its my fault for not looking into it further.\n\nIt is a nice little amp, I won't be replacing my GK with it anytime soon but for a practice or back-up I can recommend it.", "summary": "Very nice amp", "unixReviewTime": 1437350400}

There are essentially two ways to weight keys.  1.  using a spring and 2. using actual weights on the keys.  There pros and cons with both methods.  Notice when you press a spring that it gets more difficult to press the farther down you go.  When you press a lever with a weight attached, it takes an initial budge to get it going, but once it's in motion, the inertia of the key actually causes the key to get easier to push when reaching the bottom (and to hold down easier than the spring).  Most pianists prefer the actual weights on the keys because a real piano uses that method.  The springs are more difficult to play when one is not used to it.  However an organ uses springs, so organists move over to a spring action much easier than a weighted action. So sounds that are sustained like organs, strings, most orchestral instruments (flutes, trumpets etc) and pad sounds are easier with the springs, while the percussive sounds like piano, harp, guitar, drums, and other play easier on the weighted keys.  There would have to be a 2 oz weight for every key to accomplish the weighted feel.  2 x 88 keys is 172 oz or 11 pounds that would be added to the total weight of the keyboard.  Lately, some keyboards are adding a swinging weight that gives more lifelike feel to the keys as in a swinging hammer hitting the strings. Those almost duplicate the feel of a real piano.  Spring keyboards have the advantage of being lighter and cheaper to build.  Weighted keys add more weight and price to the keyboard.  The Williams keyboard uses springs.  It's not easy to tell if a keyboard has one or the other since almost all manufacturers us terms like semi-weighted (which is always springs) and in this case hammer action which here is meaningless.  But usually the price and the weight of the instrument will give it away.", "summary": "Definition of weighted keys", "unixReviewTime": 1442534400}

Arturia would have been far better off making this slightly larger in order to accommodate full size keys (as their Analog Experience: The Player did.)I find the sliders, where one might expect mod and pitch bend wheels, to be inconvenient and clumsy, not responding well, and simply not having the right feel for this product. Despite those complaints, however, I do like and recommend the controller. First and foremost, the assignable control knobs are a pure joy to use, either when coupled with Arturia's Analog Lab software, or with, for example, Native Instruments' Reaktor-- they are a pure godsend, and they make using softsynths a much happier experience. Likewise the assignable pads, which can be used as triggers, or set as latched switches for background sequences. Good stuff all around. On a purely aesthetic note, the look of the thing is classic Arturia, which is to say, gorgeous. It has a cream colored body with simple but attractive wood end panels. This unit does NOT look or feel like a cheap piece of plastic crap, unlike so many of its peers.\n  The real joy of the package, however, is in the Analog Lab software. This is everything the Analog Player software tried to be, and better. Completely avoiding the nagging loop-point clicking that their earlier software seemed to be plagued by, Analog Lab is intuitive, well organized, and chock full of classic synth sounds, from pads, to leads, drums, special effects, and oh, the glorious arpeggios. If you like electronica, the arpeggios alone will trip your trigger. This software is among the finest products I have ever used, and I've used a lot of 'em.

Here are a few things about the Apollo that make it great:\n\nDesign:\nI used many different interfaces over the years, and this is by far the most simple and elegant in appearance. The front of the Apollo seems as if to give a nod to the older days of NASA when the name \"Apollo\" was a household word.\n\nThe rear panel of the Apollo has the basics. Two Mic/line inputs, Monitor L/R, Two Line Out, Optical in, Headphone port on the front, and a Thunderbolt port. The minimal approach allows for a compact design, but can also limit usage.\n\nConnectivity:\nFirst off, let me say that I love the usage of a Thunderbolt port for an audio interface. Not many company's have done this, and it allows for some of the fastest data transfer possible. The only negative sides is that they don't supply a cable. For an interface at this price point, they should.\n\nAudio Quality:\nIn the end, this is what matters the most. With either a mic plugged in or a line level instrument everything sounds warmer, clearer, and bigger than any other interface that I've used. Between the clarity and warmth of the pre-amps combined with all of the \"vintage\" plug-ins puts this interface at the forefront of the comparable brands on the market.

I also ordered a gallon of code 6 fog juice as well just in case I didn't like one or the other. The fog machine I used on both of them was a chauvet fog machine at 20,000 cfm. Also I diluted each for juice at 1:1 with distilled water and a splash of distilled white vinegar. This was recommended by froggy's to dilute the juice so it won't clog or ruin the fog machine. I also added in the vinegar to help keep things clean since chauvet's can die if not taken well care of.\n\nComparing this stuff to the cheaper walmart brand there is a difference. It's thicker, doesn't smell bad if at all and hang around more. However the code 6 lasted a lot longer than froggy's. both were used right after one another with minimal to no wind on the same night with the same temperatures in the same location. I also tried it the next night and use froggy's first to see if the machine temp had anything to do with it. Same results. The froggy's just didn't last for me outside. I haven't used it inside but I don't think there would be different results.\n\nI would also like to point out that there are some internet trolls that froggy has or a couple fanboys of froggy's on amazon. My last review I recently took down since it saw too many people leaving negative responses toward it. It was an honest review just like this one and I wasn't being biased. Also I left a 5 star review for code 6 and was thanked by the seller but that is also getting negative reviews as well. Every review for code 6 is positive besides 2. And every positive review has 2 dislikes. I highly suspect froggys is jealous of their competition and trying to spam other reviews on their competition. It's not a coincidence that every single positive review has 2 thumbs down and 1 thumb up from people reading them.\n\nI will never by froggys again and if I see someone with a fog machine I will point them in the opposite direction.", "summary": "Not too good", "unixReviewTime": 1350777600}

Both amps clipped at the same apparent loudness. I was disappointed. But the disappointment didn't last very long...\n\nWhen my band first used the iNuke 6000 as a subwoofer amp at an outdoor festival, it sounded like an entirely different amp than what I had tested at home. It was loud. Really loud! It pushed my 21\" downward-firing subs like they've never been pushed before. The kick drum was producing a solid, deep \"whump!\" while only the first signal indicator light on the iNuke was lighting up.\n\nI didn't have my Matica along to do a comparison, but I KNOW my Matica could not have reached that volume. At just half that volume, my Matica's clip light would have been sputtering like a fluorescent hospital light in a low-budget horror movie.\n\nSo why did I get all that volume with the iNuke on the gig and not when testing the amp at home? I have no idea, but I'm guessing there might have been a difference in line voltage between my house the venue, and maybe this amp requires clean voltage. I just don't know. All I can tell you is that I was more than impressed with how well the iNuke worked on the gig. My subwoofers filled the tent beyond my expectations. I was never a fan of Behringer in general, but I believe in giving credit where it is due, and Behringer really came through on this amp.\n\nUPDATE 2017: I've used the iNuke 6000 at several outdoor venues over the past several of years, and it's been consistently and reliably cranking out at full volume.\n\nIN CONCLUSION: I've worked with a lot of different PA amplifiers over the years (AB, Alesis, Crown, Stewart, QSC, etc.) and when I feel how light this amp is, hear how much volume it puts out, and see how little it costs, I have to consider this amp to be one of the most groundbreaking values ever offered in professional audio amplification. (Unfortunately, it's also one of the ugliest amplifiers in existence, too... it kind of looks like what you'd get if a TIE fighter crashed into the Chrysler Building.)", "summary": "You really get a lot of boom for the buck", "unixReviewTime": 1378339200}

To be honest, I'm not all that great a guitar player, but it's a hobby of mine.  So I don't shell out a lot of money for high-end equipment.  That being said, I love this guitar.  The tuners work well with virtually no slip.  The action and feel is really nice (you'll undoubtedly need to get it adjusted when you first get it), and the sound on it is pretty bass-heavy, meaning it would probably do well for metal styles.  The pickups are nothing to write home about, which if you're a more experience guitarist, you'll probably swap these out right away - the stock stuff is fairly boring and average.  I get a decent amount of sustain off of this instrument, which is a definate plus.  Compared to some other guitars that I've played, this thing is built like a tank, and a bit awkward to manuver with if in an enclosed space.  The headstock feels perticularly cumbersome, and (again) can make things difficuly when you're moving around in tight quarters.  But none of that has any real bearing on the guitar overall.  But is does feel like you've slung a beast over your shoulders.\n\nThe only downside that I can find with this guitar is how the neck is fastened to the body.  If you're used to hammering away on your guitar, you'll never get a single note in tune - there seemes to be a tiny amount of play in the neck that affects intonation.  If you have a lighter touch, no problems.  So, you're not going to want to be jumping around on stage with this thing wrapped around you...aside from the fact that doing so may actually maim or kill one of your bandmates because of its bulk.\n\nAll in all it is a good beginner to intermediate guitar.

Our teenage daughters soon joined me and before I knew it, there were 8 or 10 ukes around the house.  We have ukes from inexpensive models all the way up to the $400 price point....and I've found that no two ukes sound the same.\n\nWhen I think of ukulele sound, there are three categories to my ear: guitar-ish, ukulele-ish, and toy-ish.  This inexpensive ukulele from Hola! is really surprising!  It is definitely in the ukulele-ish sound category to my ears.\n\nThis Hola! uke is very well constructed, and sounds as good as ukes we own which cost 2.5 times more.  It plays fairly easy, and stays in tune as good as any others we have (after the stings have stretched and settled in a bit).  I'm very impressed with the rosewood fretboard and rosewood bridge - really hard to believe these features can be had at this low, low price point.\n\nThis uke could be improved somewhat by taking it to a Luthier for a set up.  They would lower the strings - adjust the intonnation slightly - and maybe make a few other adjustments.  It would play a little easier and sound even better - but in our area this is a $75 service....a good bit more than the price of the instrument.\n\nI ordered this Hola! uke as a gift for my niece - she is going to love it!  Considering the quality sound, quality construction, quality materials and super low selling price - this is a SOLID 5 star item!  I think I'm safe in saying there is nothing to compare to this ukulele at this price point - and probably not even 1.5 times or 2 times this price point.\n\nI was very fortunate to receive a slight discount on this ukulele in exchange for my honest opinion and unbiased review - that is exactly what I have provided.

I especially appreciate the fact that it doesn't require a battery inside my guitar, and that its output is high enough to use without a preamp. As long as I don't need a lot of amplification, this pickup pretty much sounds like my guitar, only louder.\n\nProblem is, that's true only as long as I'm not amplifying it very much. At least in my guitar, this pickup is very prone to feedback even at moderate stage volume.\n\nI use it mostly in church. Our band is not particularly loud, but I do have to be heard (and hear myself) over an enclosed drum kit. To control the feedback, I either have to (a) use a rubber soundhole cover, or (b) EQ the lows and low-mids down by quite a lot.\n\nBoth options are bad. It's either kill the sustain with the soundhole cover, or kill the tone with the EQ.\n\nIn headphones or at low volume, if I A/B the K&K vs. the stock Fishman piezo in my other acoustic the K&K wins by a mile. However, in most cases the Fishman will actually sound better through a PA because I don't have to clobber the lows to control feedback.\n\nTIP: If you use the K&K without their pre-amp, make sure you plug it into something with a 1 Meg ohm input impedance. A high impedance input, such as the 10 Meg ohm ones on some amps, will over-emphasize the bass frequencies.\n\nUPDATE 2/3/2012\n---------------\nI had a Fishman Matrix Infinity installed in the guitar. The Matrix pre-amp has a secondary input that passes an unmodified signal to the ring of a 1/4\" TRS (stereo) plug. Best of both worlds: I can plug in a regular 1/4\" guitar cable and use the Fishman when feedback is likely, or access the K&K signal with a stereo cable in situations where feedback is not a problem.", "summary": "Pretty good, but feedback is a problem at stage volume", "unixReviewTime": 1309305600}

It pairs well with just about every other effect I have and adds a whole new dimension to the sound. If you play bass with distortion, you will find this especially handy. The EQ segment of this pedal thickens up your sound adding definition to a distorted signal so it's more musical and less \"fizzy bass.\" This paired with a Proco Rat and a treble boost makes for a great Justin Chancellor-esque tone. While its effect is, in my opinion, much less pronounced with a clean signal it still adds depth to the sound. This pedal will also provide a creamy powertube style distortion if you crank the drive a bit. My personal preference is to keep the drive dial at about 11 o'clock and use another distortion pedal for a heavy sound while the Sansamp on its own just warms up the clean tone a bit. I haven't played without this pedal on since it arrived.\n\nOn top of all of this, the DI out makes recording super easy.

I play mostly blues with a strat.  I wanted to maintain the sound of the strat while getting a little more punch.  I have a Blackstart HT20 amp and a Fender Clapton Vibrochamp.  I like the clean sounds of both these amps but sometimes you want just a little boost without altering the tone.  I have a Ibanez TS7 but the mids are very noticeable. I have a number of other boost/crunch pedals as well but none accomplish what I want to sometimes achieve.  The pedal market is overflowing nowadays.  Its sort of ridiculous.  Boutique this, boutique that.  A lot that drives price is supply and demand and not the actual sound/tone.  I saw this pedal on youtube when I was looking at the Klon KTR, which is a few hundred dollars.  I really couldn't tell a difference between the two on the youtube video.  So, for $50 I figured it was worth trying.  I wouldn't stay its the most sturdy of pedals but I am not out gigging every night so it serves my purposes for recording and getting the sounds in my cover band.  You don't have to crank the volume either to get a nice boost.  I found that you start to get a noticeable boost around 10 o'clock.  Even with the volume lower than that, I feel like I get a nice open airiness to my tone.  So I think if you are looking for a good boost, or are trying to get that Clapton/Meyer strat sound while maintaining the tone of the guitar and without buying a $2000 amp, this is a great pedal for the money.  It also sounds great with my Gibson Midtown with P90's.", "summary": "exactly what I have been looking for", "unixReviewTime": 1392940800}

Although I play all genre of music, my preferences are 19th century western tunes and old-time gospel hymns.\n\n  At first, I had my reservations about ordering a $7.00 harmonica made in China; but I must admit I was quite impressed with my investment.  It came in a cardboard box, in lieu of a case, but I didn't purchase it for the carrying case.  In order to give the Hohner Bluesband, in the key of G, a fair assessment, I wanted to play it continually for several weeks and then have something to compare it with in appearance and sound.  From the many that I own, I chose my Hohner Special 20 made in Germany.  It retails for about 7 times as much as I paid for the Hohner Bluesband made in China.\n\n  \"The first impression is a lasting impression,\" as the saying goes; and I was quite impressed with that first impression of the Bluesband harmonica right out of the starting gate, so to speak.  The BluesBand looked and felt remarkably like my Hohner Special 20. They both have a black plastic comb, (yes, even pricier harmonicas come with plastic combs) and they both have stainless steel covers and brass reed plates.  They both are identical in dimensions, weight and touch.  With my eyes closed, I couldn't tell one instrument from the other.  Afterwards, I thought to myself, \"it looks and feels great-- but how does it sound?\"  \"Is it all show and no go?\" as the saying goes.  Needless to say, it sounded wonderful.  I was so impressed with the quality of its intonation I could hardly put it down.  It sounded that good -- and all for the bargain basement price of under $7.00!  I was able to use the same vibrato and muting techniques as I do on a harmonica costing seven times as much.  I was so impressed with the appearance and sound I ordered the same make and model in the key of C.\n\n  The only negative thing I have to say about the one I purchased, in the key of G, is that both reeds in the second hole do not work.  I chalk this up to a manufacture's defect or a mistake at the assembly plant.  If any of the reeds in holes four through seven had been defective, I would've had to return it.  Holes four through seven are imperative in order to play melodies on the harmonica.  One can still play a plethora of tunes without holes one, two and ten; but four, five, six and seven -- the diatonic scale -- are crucial.  By the way, all the reeds in the Hohner Bluesband harmonica that I ordered in the key of C work with no problem.  Ostensibly, quality control was on the job.\n\n  Out of five stars, I give the one in the key of G four and a half stars for sound and price --but only because the reeds in the 2nd hole are defective.  On the other hand, I give the one in the key of C five out of five stars for both intonation and price.\n\n  In summation, if you're just now learning to play the harmonica, or you are already an accomplished harmonica player like me, looking for something to supplement your play on a whim -- the Hohner Bluesband is for you, offering both an incredible sound at a remarkable price.\n\n  On the box it reads: \"This is a musical instrument, not a toy.\"  I wholeheartedly concur with that assessment.  If you want a toy -- buy a kazoo.  Here ends my review.  I hope you enjoy playing the harmonica as much as I do.  : )", "summary": "Hohner 1501BX-G Bluesband Harmonica, Key of G", "unixReviewTime": 1391817600}

Johnston", "reviewText": "After fiddling around with several different 49-key controllers at a nearby music store, it was obvious that this Akai was in a different league (referring specifically to build quality). If you don't like/want synth keys that could be a problem. I didn't have a preference going into it, but after feeling the quality of these keys and the consistency of the velocity in my DAW, I decided quality was more important than type (semi-weighted vs. synth).\n\nAlong the same vein are the rotary encoders (dials) and the sliders -- both have an excellent feel to them and are a clear cut above every other brand I tested within a $100 price difference (up and down).\n\nThis controller also offered a far deeper level of customizability than others I tested out. Most notably was the ability to change the colors of each drum pad (something like 10 color options) on each separate bank. Perhaps this isn't a necessity, but to me it not only demonstrated the level of detail that went into building this but also helped me quickly identify different triggers/patches/etc. by building my own color scheme.\n\nThis easily weighs over 12lbs. as it is built of metal and seems like it could take some abuse (not that I tested it).\n\nThe downloadable software was nothing hyper-impressive but it felt on-par with the type of instruments/plugins that come standard in any DAW.\n\nThe ONLY reason I returned it was it's lack of deep integration with Logic Pro X. I don't understand why big-named companies don't offer more online support/etc. for services that make a significant difference to the potential customer. The Akai website wasn't bad, it had helpful enough setup instructions to get this synced with Logic Pro X. However, there's no details as to what that means, how deep the integration goes, or which sliders/encoders are mapped to which settings. Seems like a PDF an intern could build in about a day. It felt as though they were merely \"checking the box\" as opposed to spending a little extra time to build a solid, deep mapping system for both novice and expert. Moreover, the level of integration didn't go past the 1st Bank. The encoders were assigned to PAN and the sliders were assigned to track volume and the transport controls of the Akai were synced with Logic. That's where it ended. Unfortunately (and this could be just me) the Bank 1, 2, and 3 options aren't mappable and there aren't any other dedicated buttons (or even extra buttons lying around) to map to bring up MIXER, INSTRUMENT, PLUG-IN, or FX as you see on some of the other midi controllers.\n\nObviously you can still map Bank 2 and 3 manually, but switching from and between plugins/tracks/instruments ultimately meant reaching for your mouse.\n\nIn the end, I decided to go with a \"cheaper\" (i.e. more plastic-feeling) controller but one that would allow deeper integration.", "summary": "Extremely well built, but not as well designed (i.e. only surface-level integration with your DAW)", "unixReviewTime": 1405728000}

Of course, the trade off is that it'll be a bit dimmer, but you'll be able to light a little more stage area.\n\nThe one thing people don't realize about these lights is that they're not meant to light a wide area of stage. They're an effects light. They're just intended to put a wash of light on the performer's back, and send down glowing tight beams of light through a fog. They're also meant to be directly seen by the audience as the lights do produce a noticable flashing pattern that changes.\n\nUPDATE: I've launched a youtube video which shows the Colorburst in my studio. I used it as downlighting on a couple of paintings.

No sound could get through it.  I changed out the battery with a brand new one and---nothing.  Zzounds sent me a new one in a few days.  The return process was painless.  The new unit works well, so far, although you have to remember to disconnect both in and out cords after each session or the battery will drain.  That is a terrible engineering flaw.  Even with the pedal off, you still get a dead battery if you leave your cords plugged in.  Have a four-hour gig?  Better remember to bring a new pack of nine-volt batteries, or get a 9V/100mA adapter with sleeve-hot configuration.  As far as changing out the battery is concerned:  This is the worst effects pedal I've ever owned.  Using a ballpoint pen, you need to push in the spring-loaded rod, on both sides, through two holes drilled in the plastic pedal.  It is truly hit or miss.  Once you get the pedal top off, be very careful.  The pedal spring is loose.  It can pop right out and be gone, leaving you to grope around, onstage, to find it, and you probably won't. All in all, I would not order another pedal made by Behringer.  This unit is made in China, and I suppose its other effects pedals are, as well.  While some Chinese stuff is OK, I suspect the factory churning out these units is strictly bottom-of-the-barrel.  The only reason I gave this unit two stars is that it sounds pretty darned good, once it's operating.  Its design flaws are too numerous to give it any other stars, though.  UPDATE: 5/6/12: The replacement unit went through a brand new Duracell battery in one hour!  We were rehearsing, thankfully, so I put in another new battery and things were OK.  I have a converter on the way, and I'll update, in here, once I try it out.  In all honesty, I have a feeling both units may go back.  In the end, you do get what you pay for, most of the time.  UPDATE: 7/18/12:  I have now had my second unit on its converter for over two months.  It works great and sounds great.  I can now recommend this unit, but only with the converter, as it eats batteries.  UPDATE: 1/23/16:  Unit is still OK.  You do need to put a strip of heavy black tape over the blue light or it'll blind you when you attempt to adjust the controls, onstage. Make sure you can see a bit of the blue to confirm the unit is on/off.", "summary": "Very, very, cheap, plastic unit.", "unixReviewTime": 1335571200}

This mode scrolls through all the LED indicators to ensure they are all functioning properly. Sure enough, there was an LED which was no longer working, which is why I was getting a faulty cable reading. I popped open the unit and swapped out one of the red LED's for another one i had lying around the house and it now works properly again.\n\nOverall, a great cable tester. I got one with an LED that had a fairly short lifespan, but with a little soldering, its back to its healthy running self again.", "summary": "4 Years later still works....

Double the record time of the closest competitor- the TC Ditto- and about twenty bucks cheaper.  Your loop can be as long as 10 minutes, with unlimited over-dubbing.  This pedal sold out in about a day on most of the big retailers- likely due to pre-order obligations and a delayed release.  It was worth the wait.  You can add layer after layer of sound to build a wall of music.  It's a really cool tool for jamming, performing, or composing.  Operation is simple- press once to record.  Press again and it begins playback.  Press a third time to dub on top of your last layer.  If you make a mistake, press and hold- it will erase your last dub.  Tap twice to stop play of the loop.  Press and hold while stopped and you will erase the whole thing.  Switch is a soft switch, so there is no click.  It is very responsive to pressure.

That was $240 (an absolute steal that I didn't absolutely need, especially in wonky condition). For $50 less this is more fun and much smaller (almost comically small), but also hard to justify at $190. We know Orange overprices their stuff and these Micro Terrors would be a staple in most every player's home at $100/130.  I don't know Orange's fiscal realities but I have to imagine they are shooting themselves in the foot with these prices. Still, if you had some gift cards to play around with as found money like I did, it is easier to justify. That said, people who travel for a living or play on the road should absolutely consider one of these.\n\nI got it to keep on my work desk and play mostly through a good pair Beyerdynamic open headphones.

So, I narrowed my search down to a few Levys models that I like, including the M26GF, as it was advertised to adjust to 53\" (my old strap was about 52 1/2\").  Because I needed a strap quickly, I drove to the nearest Levys dealer.  His stock was limited, but he had the M26GF-DBR on hand.  It was much more expensive than Amazon's price, but I needed it to play in church that weekend, so I bought it.\n\nUnfortunately, when I got home with the strap, it was too short (about 50 1/2\" button hole to button hole).  I contacted Levys via email and received an immediate response.  Apparently, in 2015, they changed the length of the M26GF-series, from 38-53\" - as posted on their website, as well as Amazon's - to 37-51\".  The 37-51\" adjustable length is shown in their online catalog, but not their website (which, at time of this review, still reflects that).  Shortly later, I received a phone call from Mr. Levy himself, apologizing for the error.  Wow, I didn't expect that!  A few days later, I had a longer tail piece in my hand.  Now that's customer service!\n\nThe strap itself is beautiful; well constructed and comfortable.  I never would have guessed I'd come home with the dark brown version of this strap, as pictures online of that color looked really dark, but in-person, it's a bit lighter.  To compare it's color, it matches the fretboard perfectly on my Rascal.\n\nSo, if you're looking for top-notch customer service and a well-constructed product  Levys is the place to go.

I was lied to by the seller, and manufacturer, regarding the wattage. It's NOT 500 Watts. It's only about 100, to 150 Watts RMS. This dishonesty has got to stop, now.\n\nHowever, in a small venue, up to about 1500 square feet, it does sound fairly decent in the mids, and highs. Even the bass notes didn't sound bad.\n\nI am awaiting a subwoofer, which is supposed to be a 300 Watt RMS type. I'll update.\n\nThe mixer is fairly decent for it's size. There's a fan inside it, which you can hear if you put year ear close enough to it.\n\nThe MP3 player is quite pointless, because there's no display to show you what you're playing. But, I suppose it would make for a ready backup, if you only have one playlist on a USB stick. LOL.\n\nI did have to crank my tablet PC (playback device) all the way to 90 percent, and the mixer's main output, and input gain all the way to about 7, with bass, and treble set to the 3:00 position to fill the room with about half the volume a DJ would be running. I'm guessing I'll be able to pull back on some of those volumes once the sub comes in.\n\nAt the above mentioned volume settings, I walked to other rooms of my house, and it did seem fairly powerful, for it's size.\n\nOh, speaking of size, the shipping dimensions are way off. I think the seller was talking about just one speaker. The box was about the size of one of those roll around storage tubs, and was fairly heavy.\n\nEach speaker, on it's own, is not very heavy, especially once you remove the mixer, and stowed mic, and cabling. I found the included stand adaptor for the mixer, and was able to attach it to the top of a mic stand, no problem. I do wish the adaptor had the same quick release feature the mixer has for stowing, and in-stowing to, and from the speaker cab. You might want to tape a zip lock baggie on the mixer, for storing the two screws that hold the adaptor to the mixer. I'd also recommend getting a video lighting stud, to threaded mic stand adaptor, so you can quickly attach, and remove the mixer, during teardown. You'll be looking for the smaller mic stand adaptor threading, not the 5/8. As it is, I was able to thread it onto a clamp on mic boom, which I removed the arm with the 5/8 bit from, in order to use the smaller threaded mic mount. When clamped to the stand I'm using, it worked perfectly, just a wee bit of motion, if you bumped it, but quite stable enough for my gig needs. My theremin will go on main part of the stand, along with a clamp on tablet holder, and clamp on mic holder.\n\nYeh, it sure would've been nice, had the RMS Wattage been listed prominently in the product description, along with the continuous, and peak Wattage. I wouldn't have bought it. Sort of wish I hadn't, but I suppose the compact size, and power will work out fine in small pubs, where there are only about 25, to 50 peeps yammering away, as they have mug, and a pipe, with a wee sup, and fellowship. Eh?\n\nNow I've had a chance to try it out, I'll certainly keep the system, but just for small to medium rooms.\n\nI've got me eye on a fairly decent system which does have the RMS wattage of about 400 RMS watts, which should be fine for the slightly larger rooms, but this system will have to do, for now.\n\nOh, I do recommend getting a left angled female IEC to male mains cable, to make the power cable run from the mixer less \"in the way\".\n\nThe only other knit pick I have is the spacing of the mixer elements (channels) are a wee bit tight for my tastes. For example, the right angle speaker cables tend to block the USB port, or the meter LEDS, if you don't remember to slip the one nearest you under the guard rail, and then plug it in. The other can go in, as is, no problem. I recommend using straight plugs when going into the aux input, if you intend to have anything else plugged in near it. Other than that, right angle plugs can be used for XLR, or 1/4, next to each other, no problem.\n\nI'll be conducting a mic check on the mixer, and will update, soon.\n\nSpeaking of microphones, the only gripe I have over that, is the mic clip is just a wee thing, isn't it? The XLR cable just barely fits into it. The main body of the mic won't You'll break the poor thing, if you try. LOL. I recommend you pack along one, or two of your favorite mic clips, to be safe.\n\nRegarding overall quality of sound, I'd say this works quite nicely. I did not notice any hissing, or humming. I do have poor wiring, so that's a very good sign.\n\nThe speakers slipped onto my 35mm speaker stands, no problem.\n\nI like the handle on top of the speaker, which makes for easy unpack / repack. I only wish the speakers had side handles for easier mounting on stands.\n\nI noticed the speakers have floor wedge on one side, so it can be used as a monitor. Speaking of which.\n\nBy the way, if you're using a nice, higher RMS wattage system for a medium to large venue, and need something to liven up dead spats in the room, this system might be the answer for that.\n\nI only wish the seller, and factory had been up front, and forth coming with the actual RMS Wattage. I did ask the community about it, and got no answer. Hmmm...\n\nAlso did NOT appreciate the product having been shipped in it's factory retail box, which would tell every bloody porch bandit who happened along, what was waiting on the porch! Oh yes, I did catch someone trying to steel it this morning. Just happened to be watching the security cam at the time, when the delivery showed up.\n\nRight.

I soldered a 4.02kohm across the end connections of the pot (any value near it would work as well), but that only shifts the complete pedal movement to change the volume to go from half to full volume. It won't completely turn down the volume. That works OK for me. With this mod the pedal movement seems to correspond to the volume change. I'm using active instruments & send the pedal to a line of effects pedals. If you don't want to deal with this, buy a pedal with input and output buffer circuits.

Then with experimentation with both pre-amp and distortion together I began to find sounds that worked for my styles and preferences. I only have two gripes. First, there should be a software way to turn the cab simulators on. The pre-amp section is an amp simulator, not a cab simulator. But the tone and dynamics improve markedly when you use an old 1/8 male headphone plug on the headphone input which turns the cab simulator on for all outputs. Why this can't be done via a global setting is beyond me. Second, in Memory mode (using pre-defined patches) I wish the CTRL (control) feature would trigger manual on-off for the effects foot switches. The CTRL is sort of that, but it basically acts like a second sub-patch turning effects within a patch on and off, but still not allowing manual foot control.

So here's my take.\nI haven't played a lick on a Dumble amplifier or it's clones, and perhaps never in my lifetime.\nBut I've seen plenty of youtube vids about this amp that costs as much as a Benz or a BMW.\nThen came the boutique amp makers such as Fuchs, Two-Rock, Bludotone, etc., that tried to\ncopy it's sound signature but still costs around 3 to 5 grand. Then came the boutique pedals\nthat emulates this sound as well, like the Zen Drive, Ethos, Royal OD, Zenkudo, Simble etc.,\nbut still costs from $200 and up.  You can buy an inexpensive tube amp head for that amount.\nBut now we have this cheap clones of the pedals that clone the amp. I've got to try one.\n\nThis is a low to mid gain pedal. For the high gain enthusiasts, this is not a distortion pedal.\nNo Marshall or Boogie sounds here. As a stand alone pedal, this works just like an overdrive.\nMost video I've seen, the reviewers were playing mostly smooth jazz or fusion.\nIt sounds smoother that all of my OD's. Not aggressive as the OCD or Barber Direct Drive.\nIt doesn't have the bite or grit of the BB preamp nor the mid-hump of a Tubescreamer.\nThis will not give you the blues tone but who's to say? Your listeners won't know it's not a BD-2.\nIt has 4 knobs to play with. Besides volume & gain controls, the two most important knobs are\nvoice & tone. Tweak these two controls to your taste. Plenty of useable mids to insure you'll be\nheard in the mix in a band context. Built solidly in a small metal enclosure to take less space.\nThe only thing that bothered me was that I can't see my settings on the 3 black knobs of the pedal.\nI had to use a white touch-up car paint with a toothpick to put the markers on. Worked quite well.\nOver-all, this is a smooth sounding overdrive. I still have no idea if it sounds like a Dumble amp.\nBut it's not bad for a $30 pedal. And when in doubt, stick a boost pedal or a tubescreamer in front\nor after and you'll be rockin' it out just like, well, a distortion pedal!", "summary": "It does what it's suppose to do well.", "unixReviewTime": 1519776000}

I should probably buy a spare, since my solo act would be lost without it.\n\n[Updates at 3 months and 18 months are at the bottom of this review, but you should probably read from top to bottom.]\n\nI'm having a great time with this box!  It has really added a new dimension to my solo act.  I can see why others might opt for the Harmony Singer version, with its simpler operation, but the Harmony-G XT is much more versatile and I find that I am using many of its diverse capabilities.  I like the fact that I can dial in a sound and save it to one of the 20 presets.  Then I just dial up the preset and adjust the FX level and the Harmony level while I'm getting ready for the next song.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that singers with low voices will not want to employ harmony voices below theirs.  One said it sounds \"evil\" and that is as good a description as any other.  Not usable for me, but the higher voices are enough anyway.\n\nThere are some things that could be improved.  It would be nice if the box ran on 9 volts like most other pedals. Then I could daisy chain it with my tuner pedal.  [The Boss VE-2 has this feature, but I have not tried that pedal].  Speaking of which, the onboard tuner works okay, but the LEDs are pretty small.  I prefer my Snark SN-10S pedal tuner for its visibility and, unlike one other reviewer, I don't have a noticeable discrepancy between the onboard tuner and my Snark inline tuner.\n\nMy feet are large and the Harmony G-XT is small, so I find I sometimes connect with more than the foot switch when I am trying to select the harmony during a song.  This changes the effects, harmony or whatever randomly (not good) and there is no way to recover.  [after 18 months, I figured out how to solve this problem: just make A and B presets the same and then if you hit the left foot switch by accident, you won't lose your preferred sound.]  I would prefer that the box was bigger and had adequate clearance between the foot switches and the rest of the stuff (think Boss pedals, for example).  There's a lot going on with the top of this box and I have to choose my footwear carefully to use it.  How about a separate plug-in foot switch for the harmony on/off functionality?  I'm also not fond of having the box shift into tuner mode if I press the harmony button too long.  All of the sudden in the middle of a song the guitar is muted, all the effects are lost, and the harmonies aren't tracking well (bad moment on stage).  Some other way to activate the tuner mode would have been better for me, especially when I don't even use the tuner.  That said, all these defects are minor and I have no intention of giving up the tone and harmony effects because of them.  [I still don't have a solution for this problem, but I haven't accidentally selected the G-XT tuner in a year, so I guess that's okay.].  It is also possible to nudge the FX or harmony knobs with your toe, when trying to use the harmony foot switch, but I have gotten better at avoiding this, which is a good thing since if that happens during a song you are pretty much screwed and either won't have enough harmony or too much (and have to avoid it).  Again, we really need an external foot switch to allow reliable harmony switching without getting occasional unexpected or catastrophic effects.\n\nTips:  I find things get to sounding terrible in a hurry as the microphone gain increases towards the 12 o'clock position (I'm using a Shure SM 58).  If the harmony sounds unpleasant try backing off the mike gain.  I have a mark at about the 10 o'clock position on the \"input\" knob and never exceed this setting.  If I'm not perfectly happy with the harmony sound and everything seems to be connected properly, I keep turning down the input until things start sounding better.  In addition I find that a little harmony volume goes a long way and end up using less than the recommended 12 o'clock position of the harmony gain (and FX gain) most of the time.  Somewhere between 9 and 11 works well for me.  It's easier to believe that the harmony is comprised of real voices when the harmony is subtle rather than being blatant.  Blatant works okay on loud covers where the  original group belted out the harmony (think early Beatles tunes), but never more than the 12 o'clock position.  Other reviewers have noted that the harmony participation can sometimes be controlled very well by the volume and pitch of the lead voice.  If I back off of my voice volume during a low pitched passage, I can reliably make the harmony drop out without touching the foot switch.  A useful feature for me.\n\n[Update after using for 3 months:  I really like the unit; I hardly play without it, even to practice.  I stopped going to jams and open mics, because it would feel like I'm leaving my most important instrument behind.  She is a demanding mistress and I have to be attentive to her many idiosyncrasies in order to get perfect sound and harmony, but I can usually get acceptable sound after a few minutes of playing with the most important settings.  The G-XT is even having a profound effect on the songs I select and how I perform them.  Tons of songs that just weren't interesting enough when sung by a soloist are now beautiful and interesting (think Eagles, Beach Boys, Everly Brothers, etc.).  The layered harmonies are that good!  A cautionary note:  the harmonies you are capable of generating with the G-XT are highly dependent on your singing and guitar skills.  If your singing or playing style is choppy, you won't get good results; the G-XT  simply won't be able to figure out how to harmonize or will do so poorly.  It usually works fine for me, but if I start to get unexpected results and unpleasing harmonies, I find that I can often resolve the problem by simplifying my finger picking or chording or by smoothing out my vocal delivery to make it more lyric.  If all else fails, I can often get excellent results just by slowing down my delivery or turning off the harmony for a line or two or turning down the harmony participation knob.]\n\n[Update after using for 18 months.  The first point to make is I certainly don't agree with the reviewer who said that the G-XT isn't suitable for live performance because it is unreliable.  I've used it for over 100 shows and the only problems I have encountered (other than hitting the wrong foot switch (which I covered above) involved other user errors (such as those discussed below).  If you do your part the G-XT will be there for you every time.  I used to find that I needed a more  sound check time in order to be sure I had the box set up correctly for the room.  This wasn't always convenient, since in some venues you are expected to go live as soon as everything is plugged in or least without extended sound checking.  What I am primarily interested in is whether the harmonies are \"tracking\" and how much the room acoustics are affecting the optimum level of vocal FX participation and Harmony participation.  If in doubt, just start with each of them in a lower than normal position and increase the participation level if needed.  It helps to start with a \"throw away\" song -- one that tests the FX and harmony on something not too demanding and which isn't your favorite song.  Oh and one more thing that can easily happen is that you leave your (upstream) pedal tuner in \"tune\" mode after you're done tuning.  The G-XT will still try to add harmonies, but they may not be very good since it will not have the benefit of the guitar input because your tuner will mute the guitar signal during tuning.  You can also get this problem if your 1/4 inch input cable from the guitar (or tuner) is not fully inserted in the G-XT or if the input and output 1/4 inch cables are reversed.  You won't have this problem if you're playing an electric, since you will immediately notice that there is no guitar sound.  It's not as obvious if you are playing an acoustic/electric, so get used to turning that tuner off when you are done with it.  I've actually gotten well into a song before I realized that the harmony box wasn't happy.  The solution is to avoid the harmony until you can hit the inline tuner foot switch and restore the guitar input signal to the box.  Finally, I find that the overall sound is much better and more reliable when I use the guitar \"thru\" mode.  In other words, I don't let the unit mix my acoustic guitar signal and voice.  I send the guitar signal through the box and on to it's own channel on the amplifier, where I add its own equalization and effects.]", "summary": "Tips on getting the most from the G-XT!

I had no problem - these slide right in and work fine. If they did not, I was ready to grab my drill and enlarge the holes very slightly. There are collars (similar to washers but look different) that go around the knob on the outside of the potentiometers, so even if you made the holes a little too big they should still grip and stay in place.\n\nSecond, I heard the wiring diagram was incorrect. I kept the stock electronics as reference and wired it up according to the chart. Everything worked fine, and I threw out the old electronics. Maybe there was a defect in the documentation they fixed? I do not know. I recommend keeping the stock electronics around just in case, until you are confident that everything works correctly.\n\nYou will need a soldering iron and the skill to use it to install this product.

First, let's not expect $500 double 15\" sound from a portable 9v amp.  Once that reality is recognized, this puts out far better sound than one would ever expect from an amp this size and price.  (Later edit:  As a result I've bought several of them as \"guts\" for hand-made, specialized amps.)\n\nOf course the sound you get out of this amp-- as with any amp-- will be directly relational to the quality of guitar and pickup you're feeding from.  I tried this on three different guitars and each one sounded significantly different.  One had very rich tone, another sounded \"tinny\", another had a passive pickup and required I turn the HoneyTune up quite a bit more than the one with active pickup.  So it won't sound the same on every guitar.  Passive pickups will require a preamp device to achieve any volume.\n\nIf your guitar has good tone and your pickup is good, this amp is simply awesome.\n\nMy sister visited and heard it right after I opened the box, and she was impressed as well.  Neither of us expected this kind of sound from such a small amp.  And I have to say, the aqua color is major retro.  Gotta luv it.\n\nI've been looking for \"the\" portable amp for some time.  This is the best I've found to date and the value for price is a perfect balance.

I play slide, classic rock, blues, roots styles, and mostly use no pedals--just straight into a good cranked amp, for my tone.  At low drive settings, this OD is perfect for times when I want a bit more cleanish gain resulting in a smooth overdrive tone.

I actually use it mostly to push my tiny Yamaha THR solid state modeling amp (Lead mode ala vintage Marshall)into higher gain territory for sustaining slide playing.

If you only sing and do not want to spend 799 on tc helicon I would go with this. If you play guitar I would recommend the tc helicon guitar gxt.  There are 2 reasons: 1. the harmonies the boss ve-20 gives you are not good enough for live performances. even when you set the key. It just does not sound natural enough to me. I would not use the pitch correction either. (If you are a singer- work on your control instead of relying on an algorithm to bump you into place)  Again, the pitch correction changes the natural vocal and makes it sound a little too digital. If you play guitar the tc helicon is able to give you better harmonies because it uses the chords you are playing- although at times for drawn out notes- it could get wonky there too.\n2. The effects- I was able to make good effects patches that seem to fatten the vocals, and after tweaking the effects for delay and reverb-these sounded very good. If you get one of these remember -less is more- don't over -do it with too much of any effect . Once again though-having the guitar gxt I have to give the nod to the tc helicon- It is a little easier to use and the pre sets sound better out of the box- it also has a de-esser and it just puts out a crisper vocal.\nthe boss ve-20 is not bad at all, but you probably won't use 35% of the stuff they put in here.  if you make different patches say 1 just a punchy doubler rock patch and then want to use another with some delay for a softer tune- you will either have to bend over and turn knob or hold the pedal down for 2 seconds to activate the patch selection pedals.  if you are playing in a band live- and you do 3 songs with different patches in a row you may not have time to switch.\nA good addition to the boss is the ability to activate an effect for just a few seconds- like major delay or distortion using the right pedal.  you can have an effect patch and also add more effect at the end of a line in a song for added punch.\nover all- its a good vocal pedal- its solid, not too difficult to use, lots of effects and can store 50 user patches.  but like all vocal harmonizers and pitch correction products... nothing can match the natural voice of a real person.", "summary": "the one to go with for vocalists, but not if you play guitar and want harmony.", "unixReviewTime": 1518220800}

Farnsworth", "reviewText": "I use this little guy in connection with my DAW and digital piano.  I run the piano sounds through balanced cables into the line-in ports for recording, and I also run VST intruments on my DAW that I trigger via USB MIDI from the piano and use this device for digital/audio conversion.  I listen through Sennheser HD 595 headhphones plugged in to this and I also have some studio monitors attached using balanced cables.\n\nI purchased this to upgrade from my previous audio interface, the Behringer UF0202.  That device worked quite well for this purpose as well but lacked two things: a volume knob, and balanced in/outs.  The volume knob thing I could work around, but my current monitors seem susceptible to ground loops (even with a ground lift plug), so I needed to go with balanced cables.  I'm glad I did.  The balanced cables completely eliminated my noise problems.  This was a good purchase.  However, I would say to anyone who doesn't need balanced cables and is on a budget that they should consider the Behringer.  It's a tiny fraction of the price and it works pretty well.  Further, it's class complaint so you don't have to use Behringer's drivers.  It's plug-and-play.\n\nI have some good things to say about the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 (all about the hardware) and some bad things (all about the software).  I've tried using the driver version 2.1, which came with the disk, and the udpated 2.2, which I downloaded from Focusrite's website.\n\nTo let you know what I need in an interface:\n\n1. Balanced stereo in/out\n2. High quality headphone amp\n3. Volume knobs for headphone amp and for the main line\n4. Good digital-to-analog conversion\n5. Low output latency (input latency not important to me)\n\nI don't use the Mic preamps, which is one of the big selling points of this device.\n\n================ The Good ====================\n\nThis box is simple and well-designed.  It does what you want, has very convenient controls, and has high build quality.  I'm pleased with the digital-to-analog conversion.  It has a great big volume knob and another for the headphone amp.  It has switches so each input can be a line-in or microphone pre-amp.  It has a switch for zero-latency monitoring (of whatever is coming in).\n\n* The headphone amp was of particular concern for me.  I use headphones a lot and a poor headphone amp can be quite a problem.  The Behringer headphone amp was only ok.  Specifically, it has an output impedance of 50 ohms.  The rule of thumb for good headphone/amp matching is that the output impedance should be 1/8 the impedance of the headphones--my hd 595's have 50 ohms of impedance.  Breaking this rule you get distortions of the frequency response.  In my case mostly this meant attenuation of the bass.  Most manufacturers don't list their output impedance, possibly because they are embarrassed.  Anyway, Focusrite does, which is one reason I trust them a little more.  The output impedance is less than 10 ohms--respectable but not amazing.  Still not as low as I would need in principle but I can notice an improvement in the bass response in my headphones.  There's plenty of extra voltage here too, so I could drive higher impedance cans if necessary.  Anyway, good headphone amp.  Check.\n\n* Balanced ins and outs work very well,  The ins accommodates a 1/4 TRS style in and XLR.  The light around them shows when something's actually coming in and shines red when it's in danger of clipping.  There's lots of gain available.  I have them turned all the way down almost.  The outs are TRS style (balanced or unbalanced) and are located on the back.\n\n* I like the look of the box, with a red metal case, and the front and back are sturdy and attractive as well.\n\n* The USB cable is just a type B port.  This means you can replace it if it gets damaged or whatever.  The Behringer, for example, was hard-wired to its cable...king of annoying.\n\n* It's bus-powered.  I actually would have been fine with a wall-wart, but this is even more simple.\n\nI really have no complaints whatsoever about the hardware.\n\n===================== The Bad =========================\n\nThe driver for this thing is horrible under Windows XP.  I have a clean installation with nothing installed except my DAW software, acrobat reader, and this driver.  I mean, my computer is really stripped down.  Performance using the Behringer was good.  The latency (time between playing a note and hearing it out the speakers) was 8 ms using the Behringer, which isn't really perceptible.\n\nUnfortunately the focusrite driver, though it's technically ASIO apparently, doesn't have anything like an acceptable latency.  The lowest latency I could set it at and get sound out instead of crackles and pops was 23 ms.  At that level the instrument begins to sound very sluggish and laggy.  It's very difficult, at least for me, to work with a large latency like that.\n\nI was ready to return this device when I decided as a last ditch effort to install ASIO4ALL.  That's sort of an ASIO driver to use if you absolutely cannot make the manufacturer's driver perform at a decent level.  I installed it and it worked.  The output latency was a tiny 4.3 ms (only .3 of which are actually output latency, so this is REALLY impressive).  I conclude that the hardware is very, very good in this machine, but the software is horrible.\n\nUnfortunately, you can't actually uninstall the focusrite driver because otherwise windows doesn't recognize the device and it never even turns on--it's not class compliant, unlike the Behringer.  So now I have two drivers for it installed, only one of which I use.\n\nThe bad news is that this configuration is very buggy.  In general when I just turn the computer on and try and play my VST instrument, all I get is crackles and pops until I open the ASIO configuration panel and increase the buffer.  The funny thing is that it doesn't matter where the buffer starts out, I always have to increase it before I get any good sounds out.  I can start it out with a huge buffer--lots of latency--and it will crackle until I open it and increase the buffer yet more.  I have to do this every time I turn on the computer.  Also, sometimes if I leave it on for a while and come back, it will be crackly again until I increase it yet another step. We are talking about major bugs here.\n\nI decided to try ditching ASIO4ALL and trying to make the focusrite drivers work again--maybe there was a setting I was missing.  As I was trying to set the buffer size, I heard the sound of an explosion and then my computer rebooted.  When it came back I couldn't get good sounds out, even when I turned the buffer way up.  Tried rebooting a few more times, still didn't work.  So I uninstalled and re-installed the focusrite software.  At first it didn't work.  I had to install ASIO4ALL as well, and now I can sort of get sounds out of it, half the time.\n\nI hope you are getting the idea.  These drivers are terrible.  Awful.  A monkey could have written a better driver.  I would give it 1 star if it wasn't for the fact that the device works very, very well when all the stars align and the driver recognizes the drive and allows it to play.  I guess I'm willing to sacrifice convenience and stability for nice hardware when it works.  I would never use this in a live situation or when time is critical.\n\nThe good thing about drivers is that they can update and fix them.  I'm hoping for that.  They have already revised the driver once, which is amazing because even the 2.2 driver is seriously an abomination, just like the 2.1.\n\n================ Closing Thoughts =======================\n\nUnfortunately, there really isn't a USB interface that has a good driver.  The Behringer driver always worked, but if you moved the interface from one USB port to the other, it was no longer recognized and you had to reinstall the driver.  However, you didn't have to use the Behringer driver and ASIO4ALL would give you 11 ms and perform without any complications.  That's about as trouble free as I've seen in this type of device.\n\nIf you read about the Presonus Audiobox USB and the M-Audio Fast Track Pro (probably the two closest competitors to this focusrite), what you get is a bunch of comments just like this one...horrible, horrible drivers that never get fixed. Actually Mackie makes a competitor as well, the Onyx Blackjack--but the reviews of that show that the driver is possibly even worse than this one. Unfortunately none of the pro music manufacturers cares about their drivers, so we have to live with unstable systems that only work half the time.  Maybe it's better under mac.  I don't know.\n\nInterestingly, this is really the only USB 2.0 device in this range.  That's quite shocking considering how long the USB 2.0 standard has been around.  The only real implication of this is that the USB 1.1 devices like the M-Audio and Presonus can only do two channel 24/96 audio in OR out, not both at the same time.  There's not enough throughput in USB 1.1.\n\nSo in light of the competition, the Focusrite looks kind of ok.  Unfortunately all audio interface manufacturers--at least in this range of device--think there's no need for good hardware and (especially) good software.  At least the hardware in this one is up to spec.  We can cross our fingers for improved drivers in the future.\n\nBottom line: this is a fantastic, 5-star device...if you can make the software work consistently.\n\nIf you are on a tight budget or don't care about balanced in/out, I'd recommend you go with the Behringer UCA202 or UFO2020.  They are tons cheaper, class complaint, and have better drivers.  If you use a high impedance headphone with it, even the headphone amp is pretty good on that one.\n\n================ Update May 2012 ==============\n\nA new version of the driver, 2.3, came out since the writing of the above.  The new driver actually works.  I have stopped using ASIO4ALL and I get decent latency.  Once in a while--not too often--it will inexplicably require me to edit the settings and increase the buffer, and some percentage of the time when I do that it will reboot my computer.  If I don't change anything, most of the time, it works ok.  I would never use this in a mission-critical setting (i.e., gigging or pro work), but for my home use, it's good enough now.  If you have issues with the driver, definitely update.", "summary": "Excellent hardware--Horrible driver", "unixReviewTime": 1322179200}

Very friendly staff.\nTurns out there was a Shure partner in New Delhi and I went to their location and they changed the phones for new ones on the spot. With two years manufacturers warranty, that's awesome.\nThe design flaw still stands of course. I'm Shure they'll fix it.\nI wouldn't want to use another set of cans. These are just perfect.\n\nUPDATE: July 2012\nThere is a metal T shaped hook that fits into the top (head) piece. Its held in place by a plastic cap covered by 4 small screws. This plastic cap has broken on my right cup and its about to break on  the left as well (I just checked).\n\nThis plastic \"cap\" that holds down the metal T joint, is very easy to break. It broke on my right can and is almost broken on the left as well. Ive put up some pictures.\n\nI really think Shure needs to look into this and strengthen the design at the joints.\n\nThese caps should've been made of metal. Mind you, I have used these phones VERY VERY carefully. I don't see these working in a real commercial studio environment.\n\nApart from that still a great sounding pair of cans.\n______________________________________________________\nMy mixes improved when i started using these cans.\n\nThey do bring out reasonable mid range detail you want to hear when you're EQ'ing your mixes. They are decently transparent and have close to a flat response.\n\nTo know exactly how the response of these cans are, search \"Shure SRH440 + frequency response\"\n\nThey are reasonably flat upto say 3khz and then there's a dip from 3 to 8 khz followed by a spike to return to normal at say 10khz after which the response falls off.\n\ni did some research and chose these over the 840. A Shure engineer or something like that said these were better for mastering/mixing. You can google \"Shure 440 vs 840\" if you'd like to confirm.\n\nI just didn't really like the plastic feel of some of the connectors.

I've played and used MANY different brands and types of strings and until now my two \"go to\" brands for good strings at a decent price were DR & D'Addario (Thomastic Infeld's are the best IMHO, but they fall well outside of the \"decent price\" genre...)\n\nAnyway, About a month ago I needed some strings and since I had heard of the new BT sets from D'Addario I thought I'd give em' a shot....  I've regretted it ever since.... (I ordered the  EXL120BT's)\n\nTo the point.....\n\nI install the strings, stretch them a little afterwards, tune em, clean/polish everything, spray a small coat of Fingerease and let it dry, etc...  My standard string install method I've used a 100x over or more with no problems or no noticeable issues...\n\nThen i start to playing....  (biggest mistake I've made this year so far)....\n\nAround 2 minutes into playing on the new strings (I use a few Gilmour solos to stretch the strings out after I install a set) I notice that my fingers on my left hand are REALLY starting to hurt, (especially my ring finger)....  When I stop and take a look at my fingers, I can see little tiny \"fine hair\" like metal splinters ALL OVER each finger, and a few of the larger normal sized splinters most of us have seen from time to time...\n\nSome are really small and difficult to see without a magnifying glass, and, others are your standard metal shard, but ALL hurt like %#!$@!!!!  ESPECIALLY when you touch anything with those fingers... (You know, like a guitar fretboard for instance)\n\nFast forward to today....  And I SWEAR that I am not exaggerating....\n\nI have not been able to play guitar since this happened due to the pain in my fingers, and I have pulled no less than 30 metal splinters from my middle, pointer and pinky finger on my left hand combined.... (I have finally gotten them all out as of about a week ago, which is around 3 weeks after the \"incident\")\n\nAs for my ring finger, the last count on it was 63 metal splinters (most being the little fine hair-like ones that are difficult to see without a good magnifying glass and get out without precision tweezers, but feel like knife wounds when you touch a hard object) that I have removed...  There are still several in this finger of the larger type and are so deep that I am unable to get to them so far..  I'm going to have to visit a doctor for these most likely...\n\nNeedless to say, I will NEVER buy another thing this company makes...  If you had gone through what I have (and still am), I can assure you that you'd be there with me...\n\nWorst experience in my life with a product..  If I was the lawsuit type, they would have one....  (& if this doesn't end soon, they may still)\n\nBUYER BEWARE.....\n\nDon't say you weren't warned....", "summary": "HORRIBLE Quality Control....

I know I would have paid a lot more to take it to a string repair shop (goes with the territory of owning a stringed instrument-you get to pay the big bucks).\nThe following is a few days after receiving the violin: The only thing is... you really have to know a bit about violin set up before using this violin. Reading the reviews was helpful: yes, you need to immediately install different strings. And yes, you probably will need to put chalk or some other material on the tuning pegs; they will slip - a lot. Also, the fine tuners are a little hard to handle -  but cheap to replace.\nONCE you have dealt with these issues, you will find that the violin is highly playable and what a sound.(!)  I used it through the house stereo system for the fun of it-the low end is deep and rich. The \"action\" (string height / playability) is excellent. There really isn't a cheap feel about it even though it is a really inexpensive instrument.\nTalk about bang for the buck- great case, video/book combo. Toss out the bow-completely worthless. You'll probably abandon the headphones.\nI particularly like to play it without amplification for practicing. It is barely audible outside a 10 foot range- now that's nice.\nGo for it- but again, expect set up issues. Solvable but requiring a bit of patience and know how.

They tested fine when I received them new.\n\nIf you own and of the Monoprice cables, I recommend that you test them with meter for shorts between the conductors.\n\nI cut the ends off the cable and tested ends and they were fine. The cable was still shorted with no ends on it. I put a meter on one end and cut 12\" off one section at a time until the short was gone so I could locate the bad section. I opened the bad section of cable and it has the 2 inner wires, black and white coated, plus the bare copper shielding.\nTHE BLACK WIRE HAD THE SHEATH PULLED APART ABOUT 1/4\" AND THE COPPER WIRE UNDERNEATH WAS EXPOSED AND TOUCHING THE COPPER SHIELD WIRE WHICH CREATES A SHORT IN THE CABLE BETWEEN THE RING AND THE SLEEVE.\n\nIn all fairness, if rolling them up normally or walking on them lightly a few times on stage causes this then its my fault but I have never in 30 years had any cable ever fail internally, its always been the cable end connectors that go bad or get loose.\n\n*******UPDATE 6-28-14********\nI contacted Monoprice and they provided excellent customer service.

The ends are not the problem, its the inner sheath covering the small black wire, its pulling apart and shorting out with the sleeve shielding wire on 3 cables but this one is short tip & ring.

But It simply did not work for me for a number of reasons. First, when you strike the drum pad on some of the selections, you must hit it really hard to be able to hear anything. This was also the case upon connecting it to my high-end Behringer amplifier.  Secondly, the drum pads are laid out and spaced a bit clumsily, with eight of them being a bit overboard. (Consequently, I found myself hitting the metal frame more often than I'd like to.)  Third, some reviewers complained of the foot pedals, and they are right--they are crap.  Ditto with the headphones, as I used my Sennheiser for better quality of sound. I am also confused as to why the price of the ailing kit is the same as the drum machine itself.\n\nThere are positives however: it has a very nice sound, ports for use with a snare drum stand, and a very diverse song database for learning the art of percussion. You may also appreciate the light weight, and portability.\n\nAs an alternative before you buy, take a look at the PYLE PTED06.  It has comparable features (except for the snare stand ports), much better reviews, and will save you $60 or so. Also, each drum pad features a little light that flashes every time you hit it, which is a great visual tool for beginners like me. Within the first 5 minutes of sampling it, I could tell it was more logical as a path to help me learn percussion.  The foot pedals sound much better, are also louder, and are more stable.\n\nBut whatever you decide, I say experiment with it and trust your first instinct.

Overall, the delay effect is the best on the market right now. It's a cinch to use, and having a tap tempo built right into the pedal is AWESOME. As a user (and abuser) of delay in my effects, I can tell you, tap tempo is KEY. The delay on this guy is warm and fuzzy sounding, for lack of a better word, and this has a lot to do with the analog simulation. Definitely a plus. The multiple tape head position simulation settings add a neat dynamic to the delay effect you cannot get with most other delays, which is also nice.\n\nThe reverb leaves something to be desired. I find to to be just passable - nothing special. This is coming from someone who is used to spring-mechanical fender reverbs, so my tastes may be coloring my opinion somewhat, but I find the reverb here to be a little dead sounding.  One thing that I definitely don't get is why there isn't a separate on/off pedal for the reverb, or at least a port on the back to hook up a switching pedal to do the job - that would've been quite handy. My sound is such that I frequently have a need to turn delay on & off, but I leave my reverb going throughout - there is no way to accomplish this if you are using this pedal as your primary delay/reverb box. This severely limits the usefulness of the reverb effect in my opinion.\n\nWith the exception of the aforementioned lack of a switching mechanism for the reverb, the selection of ports on this device are pretty good - stereo/mono in/outs, switchable direct out, a jack for an expansion pedal for controlling things like intensity, etc, make it a pretty flexible device.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that 3 years after buying my first unit, it developed a strange side effect - when the device is in bypass mode, the whole signal is cut out - this is NOT NORMAL BEHAVIOR, in this respect the Space Echo should work like every other pedal in the market, passing the clean signal through when the effect is disengaged. Despite this I bought a second one, because I need that Space Echo sweetness for my rig, and anyway I am of the opinion that this is just a random fluke and not endemic in the line. I've had tons of BOSS pedals over the years and this is the first time -I've- had any problems with one, although it should be noted that a friend of mine bought a tuner not too long ago and it was bad out of the box. It makes me wonder about Roland's quality control as of late...\n\nAnyway 4 stars:\nPros:\n - Awesome delay: the best on the market in a pedal.\n - Excellent array of ins/outs.\n - BUILT IN TAP TEMPO\n\nCons:\n - Price: expensive for a single purpose guitar pedal. Arguably worth it.\n - Reliability:  First one only lasted 3 years before developing a weird quirk.\n - Lack of a switchable way to engage/disengage the reverb seems like an oversight.", "summary": "The best sounding digital delay pedal on the market.", "unixReviewTime": 1332115200}

Hill", "reviewText": "A good studio monitor will reproduce the sound of an original recording accurately without coloring it in any way. In other words, a graph representing the sound coming out of the speaker, compared to the sound going in would be flat, or unchanged. This is important when making recordings, because the program will be heard as it was recorded, so it can be adjusted as required  for example if in playback if the bass is thin the recording can be edited. In contrast to using normal speakers and amplifiers for playback you might not notice deficiencies in the recording because consumer audio equipment often have enhanced bass built-in. So, if using regular speakers to edit a recording, a bass deficiency might not be noticed while being played back but might be glaringly obvious when played through another audio device without enhanced bass, like a smart phone or MP3 player.\n\nThe 3 Series from JBL provides a combination of components that insure a flat reference sound. The input cable can be either an XLR connector or a TRS Balanced phone plug, which provide compatibility with professional mixing equipment and eliminate consumer-grade connectors that might affect the sound. It also has a switch so that both high and low powered devices can be accommodated.\n\nThe speakers built-in amplifier insures flat sound amplification and eliminates the connections and equipment between the sound source and the speaker. And, the woofer and tweeter are tuned to provide a flat response across the entire rated sound spectrum of 43 to 23,000 Hz.\n\nA bonus with the 3 Series speakers is the cabinet, which includes a waveform guide on the face, whose design was lifted directly from JBLs much more expensive speakers. The high frequency driver (tweeter) is mounted at the back of the recessed guide, which disperses the sound far more widely than conventional speakers that mount the tweeter on a flat face at the front of the speaker. So, you can move back and forth in front of the speaker without the sound changing. There is an excellent demonstration of this feature using a moving microphone under the model number LSR305 on YouTube.\n\nI made recordings using an electric guitar and microphone on my PC which I then played back on this studio monitor, and it performed exactly as promised.

I'm writing this nearly four years later.\n\nAs with any stringed instrument, the strings really needed to stretch out before they would stay in tune. So, for the first several days, it was play a few minutes, tune, play a few minutes, tune. Then it was tuning daily. After a few weeks of this, the uke held a tune great. A tuner is not included in the package, which is the bulk of the minus star because a real beginner wouldn't have a way to tune the thing. (You need either a tuner or a reference note, say, on a piano or keyboard.) You can download a decent tuner app, though, for a buck or so. Do it, because you're going to need it a lot for the first couple of weeks.\n\nThe \"Firebrand\" ukulele is a laminated instrument of unknown wood. It's kind of dead-sounding. But then, soprano ukes generally sound a bit flattish to me - it's part of their distinctive character. The finish, while smooth, is spotty, and the decal around the sound hole has bubbles. But the fretboard is just barely adequately finished, with frets that are nicely flush with the edge of the neck so the feel is smooth - and has stayed smooth despite temperature changes. The beveled fret edges are filed, but not especially polished; even so, there's nothing to snag or catch. Fret dots are inset (one quite deeply) into the fingerboard and also painted on the upper edge of the neck, a nice touch. The action on mine is okay, at least down near the headstock where the starter chords live. The tuners are a triumph of cost-engineering: stamped metal with solid gears, so they're a definite step up from simple peg tuners. They make fine adjustments quite smoothly, and hold well over time. The bridge is slotted, so when you re-string you don't have to mess with that weird knot, just knot the end.\n\nI visited a specialty ukulele shop yesterday thinking of upgrading, and played with budget beginner soprano ukes costing three times what I paid for this whole set, and to me they played about the same and most even sounded the same; a few were a bit louder. They were all, however, finished to a much higher standard. I left empty-handed, but will probably get a better uke sometime soon. They're fun!\n\nThe bag is lightly made, unpadded, and has a fixed-length strap for carrying. It offered no advantage over just grabbing the uke to carry it, while adding the considerable disadvantage of needing to unpack it to play. It promptly went into the giveaway pile.\n\nWe haven't watched the DVDs, because the book has been great. It starts with C7 and F, and then adds C and G7, then G and D7. So it's not the C Am F G combo very common on YouTube. The songs are American folk traditionals, so if you've been around a campfire where any singing was involved, you've probably heard them before. There are lots of good instructions available online, including videos, so, really, the book is just a kick-starter to get you going. It's a pretty good book, with a reference section at the back with more chord diagrams than you're likely to need.\n\nIn all, it's an acceptable inexpensive starter set, not worth the \"list price\" but an OK value at Amazon's discounted price and a bargain at the Gold Box/Lightning Deal price.\n\nUPDATE: I changed the strings to the Aquila Nylgut AQ-4 set. Yeah, they're $10 strings on a $15 instrument, but the improvement in sound is just huge. I also polished the frets and fingerboard with a \"magic eraser\"-like product (an ultra-fine abrasive), shined up the body, and filed down the plastic saddle (which simply pops out of the bridge) to lower the action. It plays and sounds much better now, although the intonation remains sharp on several notes if you go note-for-note up the frets.\n\nUPDATE #2: OK, after going through the book I binge-watched the DVD. It consists of two segments of about 33 minutes each, each segment subdivided into easy-to-locate chapters that follow the pages of the book. It's really very good! The \"instructor\" (and remember, I bought this four years ago so this may have changed) was musician Julia Jordan. Production values were good, and the multi-angle views of playing were helpful, as were all the play-along segments. Minor quibbles: Jordan played a larger ukulele than the one in the pack, so you can't hold it in the exact same way. And it seemed like the songs were keyed to a higher register than her natural speaking/singing voice (you can hear her singing her own songs on a special feature and she's very pleasant to listen to).\n\nUPDATE #3: I now own a couple better ukuleles, have been a member of a ukulele meetup, and play a little almost every day. I can tell the difference between any of my better ukes and this one by both feel and ear. Still, it's a totally useable instrument, and it got me started on an enjoyable little musical hobby. Just remember to download a tuner app and maybe a metronome app and you're good to go.", "summary": "A bargain-bin good-enough ukulele that's held up for years now and is still fun to play.", "unixReviewTime": 1460246400}

I needed a bass as I do not always have a quality bassist at my availability so, Having bought Squires before I felt that this was a pretty good gamble that for a low amount of money I'd get a quality instrument.\n\nOut of the box I'd stack this bass against any Fender P bass that is hanging on a rack in any store. The craftsmanship is outstanding, it's already dialed in for action and intonation. My only other recent experience with an Indo Squire was the Surf Green 62 I bought from a local Music store.\n\nI remember seeing it as I walked and thinking \"YUMMY!\" A surf Green Strat but I was saddened when I saw it was a Squire. Something inside prompted me to pick it up and play it. To my astonishment it played great so I plugged it into an amp and she sounded amazing. I still couldn't believe it so I grabbed a $2500 Custom Shop Strat off the wall and compared them side by side and guess what. That Squire sounded and played just as nice as that custom shop.\n\nI own one USA Tele, Three Clones, Two Mexi Strats, One Clone and one Indo (Squire Strat) a Gem, a Kramer Beretta and now this P-Bass.\n\nMy thoughts, Sorry but I am not so patriotic that I am going to spend unneeded money just to get a guitar that was made in the USA when I can buy a Mexi or an Indo Fender/Squire that is just as good and as far as parts? Whatever! It's technique that get's tone. That Bass will sit as it is and sound amazing for years to come.\n\nPS... If you do not agree with me fine. I am only sharing my some odd 40+++ years of experience.\n\nPlease do not harass me by telling me I do not know what I am talking about etc.\n\nIf you do I'll have to get out my Troll Spray and annihilate you. ;-)", "summary": "Squires are every bit as good as Fender Guitars", "unixReviewTime": 1414022400}

Yeah, I know, better wood, better paints, better seals and electronics, I get it, but the Gibsons are still not woth the thousands of dollars they want for one. A lot of big name pro's have done numerous comparisons and average say the difference in sound and build quality is around 15%. 15%, is that reallyworth five to eight times the price. Don't think so. The action out of the box was set a little high and since I got the \"Floor Model\" it had plenty of finger jam on the frets so it took a good cleaning.  A new set of Elixr Strings and I lowered the Action. Frankly, I would put this Guitar up against any Gibson Les Paul costing thousands more.  As with my other Epiphone Les Pauls - If I played them to a blindfolded audience that were experts in guitars, they would not be able to tell the difference. Well, except in the sustain area where the Epiphones for some reason really run circles around the Gibsons. These guitars sustain forever. John Lennon and George Harrison plaed Epiphones, Joe Bonamassa has a Signature Model, Gary Clark Jr plays an Epiphone. If you want to pay more and brag, go buy a Gibson - But, if you want a solidly built guitar that sounds incredible, looks amazing, and doesn't break the bank, you gotta give Epiphone a chance - You will not be disappointed.", "summary": "Why Pay More for a Gibson?", "unixReviewTime": 1484092800}

However, the sound that gets produced by the filters in this box are extraordinary.  I've used it with several tube amp setups over the years and always prefer to have the signal routed from this box in my monitors as opposed to hearing the amp direct.  It's got a really high-end sound that is sophisticated and flexible.  It really makes a live rig sound amazing.  I use this through the PA to the house with that same signal to my monitors.  You'll ask yourself how you went so long without this little thing.  The sound filter options are really great and don't add too much of the 2kHz sound that is sometimes prevalent with inferior speaker simulations.\n\nOne thing to mention is that the Palmer PDI-03 is this same device with a power soak (load box) in a 19-inch rack format.  It is, of course, equally as amazing.  I use the rackmount in my studio to record guitars since I can't feasibly mic up any amps in my home and I get the same flexibility I need live.\n\nAs another reviewer noted, this isn't the DI box type that you plug your instrument directly into.  This is meant as a through-filter box to the board between your amp's power section and the speaker.  It will essentially spit out the speaker-sim filtered signal (balanced XLR) along with a through-output straight to the speaker from the power amp, as normal.\n\nTL;DR - if you're considering buying this box, you already heard how awesome it is.

You can completely remove the back rest to make it a smaller profile either while playing or for portability. It also is a nice sturdy weight without being heavy- well built.\nIt also looks very professional and keeps a low profile where other stools specifically designed for bass players take up more floor space, are heavier and MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE.\n\nCONS:\nBack Rest: is a bit too far back to really put to good use. You have to lean far back. One more drilled hole to bring the back closer would have been perfect\nPadded seat: While a well padded seat is essential to ease the pain on the bum in long practices, rehearsals, the seat is made of vinyl/leather which is not breathable therefore ensuring a sweaty bum!

The idea of having a vintage Fender Deluxe Reverb channel and a more modern channel (both with reverb and vibrato) is very seductive. The tone of this amp is exactly what I expected and was excited about, but three issues immediately raised their heads within the first fifteen minutes of unboxing both the amps I brought home.\n\nThe first issue was the hiss, that godawful hiss you can hear even when the volume pots are at \"0\" and there's nothing at all plugged in to either channel. At \"0\" the hiss on these amps is comparable to the hiss you would begin to hear on the '65 Deluxe Reverb and about \"4.5\" or \"5\". For someone like myself who plans to primarily use this amp at lower volumes at home, the hiss was unbearable; you can easily hear it under everything you play at lower volumes and you'd need a noise gate in your recording equipment to get rid of it if you planned to use the amp for recording. If you plan to use the amp at higher volumes (beyond \"5\") and in environments with high ambient noise, then I don't think it's really an issue.\n\nThe second issue is the ticking vibrato: Apparently it's quite common for the vibrato/tremolo in the 68 Deluxe Reverb to make a faint ticking sound that increases or decreases in frequency with the speed pot. In some amps it's apparently more noticeable, some less, some not at all, and in some it sounds like a faint whoosh (I heard it on three different amps). It's also an issue on the '65 Deluxe Reverb as well. If the Vibrato is turned off via the footswitch, the sound goes away entirely.\n\nUnfortunately, if you intend to use this amp at low volumes in a quiet setting with the vibrato engaged the ticking sound might drive you batty. It did me. If you want to mic and record with it at low volumes (the clean volumes), you'll be unable to get rid of the ticking when the vibrato is engaged. However, if you plan to use the amp in louder settings at high volumes, then you probably either won't hear it mixed in with the amp's natural breakup or it won't bother you. At home I could easily hear it while playing at volumes in the clean range under \"4\"; In the broken up range beyond \"5\" it blends into the overall sound while you're playing.\n\nFender is apparently aware of this issue and considers it normal for both the '65 Deluxe Reverb and the '68 Custom Deluxe Reverb. According to a little internet research there is a potential fix for the tick if you take it to a knowledgeable tech. Fender is even aware of the fix (I read they published a service bulletin for it at some point), but I guess they decided the expense or time/attention to detail involved in implementing the fix during the manufacturing process isn't worth it. That's sort of disappointing to hear. If there wasn't a potential fix and it was simply an artifact of the vibrato that couldn't be gotten around, I'd have given the amp another star, but I think Fender loses that star for apparently being cheap and/or lazy.\n\nThe third issue is reverb feedback. Id read about it in a couple of forums and only experienced it on one of the amps I brought home. What can I say, it was deafening, and occurred when both the volume and reverb were turned up beyond 5. Not actually something Id normally do anyway, but it happened and I got the full dose of what others have mentioned. Ive read suggestions where putting some padding above the reverb tank fixes the issue, but then why doesnt Fender do that at the factory? I also didn't experience this with the 65 deluxe reverb, so Im guessing it has to do with the modifications to this amp that increase its baseline gain beyond that of the 65.\n\nIn sum, if you're chasing that clean Deluxe Reverb tone, also want a channel with a more full, modern tone, and either don't mind the hiss, or the ticking, don't use vibrato, or will be playing in situations where it's unlikely to be noticeable due to other ambient noise, and have some extra sound dampening foam laying about to cover the reverb tank, then, by all means, go for it. If you're like me and will be using it primarily at home or for recording and plan to use the vibrato, then I doubt you'll be excited at the prospect of paying over $1k for an amp with a bum ticker, a screaming reverb, and the vague hope that you can pay someone to fix it down the road (or take the time to do it yourself if you're skilled in that area). It's the sort of thing you'll either be able to live with and you'll love this amp regardless, or you won't. The many folks who give this amp high praise obviously don't mind the hiss, have had their hearing previously destroyed, or got lucky and have one in which the ticking isn't noticeable and the reverb doesnt feedback for some reason. For me that was far too many strikes against this amp, and I tried two from different stores and different manufacturing runs that both had these issues.", "summary": "Hisses Like a Snake About to Strike, and with a Screaming Reverb That Would Put an Upset Child to Shame.", "unixReviewTime": 1457136000}

When I bought a rather expensive LPR0, I became concerned with it's weight and the possibility of the strap slipping off.

I purchased this leather model and it's just right for my Les Paul's (have an LPR8 now too), it works great on my Strat and Tele as well. I have since also purchased the Planet Waves 'Tweed' fabric version to match my 58 AV Tele, the locks work fine but the cloth slips more on my shoulder so I prefer the leather. Easy investment for your valuable guitar or important gig. Great strap!\n\nNote: I bought this a few years back and I'm just getting around to the review, it's still my favorite.\nUpdate: 11/25/2015 : I have recently noticed on my Les Pauls that my two Planet Wave locking straps are wearing the clear coat off right around the forward strap button. I believe this is because the strap pulls back on the LP and creates a lot of friction on the finish. With my Tele and Strat the button and body shape cause the strap to be held away from the body and paint. For this reason I would no longer recommend these straps with Les Pauls, and I would watch carefully how the strap fits on any guitar. Very disappointed that this has happened to two of my beauties.

After I purchased it (before it arrived) I read another review where the person said it does NOT contain a 1/8 or 3.5MM stereo line input jack. They are correct.  I just figured all PCM recorders must have one. Nope!  You *can* convert your 3.5MM plug to 1/4\" with an adapter, then plug that into one of the XLR jacks on the bottom (which double as 1/4\" inputs as well.)  Unfortunately, those are mono inputs, so a stereo 3.5MM plug mic set becomes mono. Yes, it's not like it's a manufacturing flaw, but I would've liked to see this standard feature in a higher level model like this.  Again, to clarify, I'm not rating it a \"dislike,\" based on that, but they could've done better here.\n\nI kept the DR-40, because one interesting thing you can do with it which I didn't expect is record drums fairly well.  You position the built in microphones to the outward position, then run a snare mic into an XLR port, and a kick mic into the other XLR port, and use the DR-40's '4 track' setting.  Hang it upside down from the ceiling a few feet over your kit.  The built in mics act as overheads, and the other 2 mics capture your most important parts.  Compared to what 2 overheads and a 4 track mixer would cost, this recorder is a deal just for that in itself.\n\nI did mess with the overdub mode, and found that if you use the \"mix\" setting, you do tend to get \"drift\" described in other reviews.  I found this problem while trying to do a song with 5 part harmony, but here's a much simpler way to understand how the problem works:\n\nSay you record a track into the built in microphones, and all you do is speak 1,2,3,4,5,6 .. 1,2,3,4,5,6 with one second between each number.  You switch to overdub mode, and turn on \"mix.\"  Hit record twice, and you will hear yourself speaking the numbers.  On this track, you record yourself clapping each time you hear yourself say \"1.\"  Hit stop.  Hit record twice again, and you'll hear yourself speaking the numbers, and clapping on the 1 count. On this mix, you will clap only when you hear yourself say \"2.\"  Do this 6 times, and you should have a final recording of you speaking 1-6 twice, and  clapping on all beats (in theory.)\n\nHowever, what drift does is causes the beats to not match up by the final recording.  You will notice some claps in the final product will not be exactly on the count, even though you recorded them correctly.  This is drift.  What does this mean to us end-users?  It means if your goal is to record perfectly synchronized ANYTHING with this DR-40 using overdub mix mode, you should instead record individual tracks (without the mix setting), then export them to a computer program, and synchronize them there.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the audio quality of the recordings is excellent, the rest of the features are good, and it's very user friendly, and most importantly somewhat portable (although, you won't be sneaking it through the security line at a concert unseen.)\n\nFor those who have done their research, and want this product, it's probably 4 or 5 stars.  The XLR inputs with phantom power available area  great feature for a portable recorder, for sure.. it's just not exactly what I was looking for.", "summary": "No 3.5MM / 1/8\" stereo line in.

From being susceptible to picking up power supply whine, to static on movement, to outright failure, cheapo cables cause problems.\n\nAdditionally, the cheapo cables also alter your tone, and you don't really notice it until you do side-by-side with something better. If your guitar lacks \"sparkle\", you might be experiencing tone-suck from your cables.\n\nMany of the budget brands use the cheapest materials available. It is not unusual to see recycled copper, cheesy shielding and brittle plastic used to create a cable these days. All this leads to high capacitance -- and a capacitor is what you put in the circuit as a \"low pass filter\", which means it kills the treble -- only allowing lows to pass.\n\nGood brands use oxygen-free copper, plated tips, strain-reliefs, and quality coverings to increase durability. This is what the MediaBridge cables have. (Please review the pictures.)\n\nShipped in a plain brown box, the cables have a very pliant cover that bends easily, yet doesn't have a \"memory\". The tips are gold plated to limit corrosion and keep impedance (essentially \"resistance to flow of alternating current\") low over the longer term. The ends are solid molded and have a durable, robust feel to them.\n\nI do not have an oscilloscope at my disposal to demonstrate the capacitance and frequency response, but A/B testing with one of the aforementioned \"cheapo\" cables\", it is evident that the MediaBridge cables are not interfering with the tone. The cheapo cable has a subtle, yet noticeable, decrease in the very high end of a Strat played clean into a regular PA system.\n\nOf course, pedals and amps can mask that if you are using distortion or other sonic modification, but just the increase in reliability make these cables worthy of a serious look (especially for anyone that plays live -- where things that CAN fail, WILL fail.)

The lifetime warranty doesn't hurt, either. This cheaper option let me buy a case, too. You can pick up a pickguard for these for really cheap if you need one. Because it shares it's design with the Gibson and Epiphone 335 style guitars, you can find many ways to upgrade this guitar if you outgrow it's features.

They include a tool to remove the original bushings, which is convenient. Probably nothing wrong with the original tuners, but I like the time savings and ease of using locking tuners. The mounting holes lined up perfectly, and installation was very easy. The locking system took a little getting used to. All my other locking tuners have locking knobs on the back of the tuners. I like that system because you just pull the string to a light tension, tighten the knob, and the string is locked. Two hand operation is very simple. There is a slotted nut at the top of the posts on these Gotoh's. To install a string, use a coin and loosen the post locking nut until a string can fit through the string hole. Thread the string through and pull the string taught. To lock the string, rotate the tuning buttons and an internal post rises up and touches the string to lock it in place. At this point just tune to pitch normally by rotating the tuning buttons. It is a lot easier is you have a powered string winder like the Ernie Ball power string winder. Until the string is locked in place, you have to keep tension on the string with one hand. The power string winder makes this a quicker operation. Tuning operation is smooth, and accurate. Once the strings are tuned and stretched, they stay in tune for me. I also lubricate the nut slots every time I change strings, so that helps prevent tuning problems as well.\n\nRemoving strings is a little trickier than with the knob-style locking tuners. The slotted locking nut on the top of the tuner posts does not want to turn very far with a string installed. It is easy to remedy by loosening the string with the buttons and a string winder until there is no tension on the string. then cutting the string close to the tuner post. Once this is done, the slotted locking nut can turn with the short piece of string still installed until the string unlocks.\n\nSo, they are not as convenient to use as the locking tuners that have a locking knob on the back of tuner, but they look great and I did not have to drill into or modify my headstock. Everything lined up perfectly. The trade-off is well worth it for me.", "summary": "Drop-in replacement for a Gretsch G5445T", "unixReviewTime": 1452643200}

As a guitar hobbyist/neophyte I could never justify the cost of a tube amp, even used. (Tube amps are heavy and expensive to ship, so even if you see one used that's reasonably priced, shipping is always the \"gotchya\".) I saw this on sale (not on Amazon, see other comments) with free shipping and couldn't resist.  Pulled the trigger.  After a few days, my little modeling transistorized practice amp is now relegated to duties as a second speaker for a couple stereo FX pedals I have (and as a spare for travel, as the Monoprice is a much heavier unit).  Cutting to the chase -- this amp simply sounds amazing.  I know people love to mod these things, but I intend to keep mine stock. It sounds great Everything they say about tube amps is true. I'm a believer.  (If you're new to guitar, I'd skip the many practice amp offerings and go straight for this unit's little brother -- 5 Watt Monoprice, for less than $100..)  It looks great, sounds even better, has good build quality, and is feature rich.  It doesn't have a dirt channel but press the < 1 Watt red button, crank up the gain, viola -- and the signal breaks up really nicely and musically with surprising grit. It has an effects loop (not used yet) and a true spring reverb.\n\nA word about reverb.  The spring reverb sound is very important to me as Surf is a genre I enjoy playing. So, a pedal I invested in is the Boss FRV-1, which is designed to digitally emulate a 1963 Fender spring reverb sound -- and it does this rather well. It's the only pedal I know of that authentically \"drips\"  like a real spring tank reverb unit (if you play Surf, you know what I mean).  Some have criticized this unit's reverb.  Maybe they heard older models of the amp and \"internet rumors\" (to be taken with a grain) suggest that Monoprice made improvements to newer units reverb. Or, more likely, they are used to the exaggerated spacey reverb tones (which have their place too) of modern reverb pedals, which a spring reverb does not emulate. However, I did a subjective comparison between the FRV-1 pedal and this amp's built-in spring reverb and prefer the tone of the authentic reverb tank built-in to the amp to the spring reverb pedal.  Even used in conjunction with the pedal, the pedal doesn't add much.  I'm thinking of selling the Boss and (my possibly my overdrive pedal).\n\nBottom line. This amp is simply a steal even at full retail.  I'm just blown away by it. Pull the trigger.", "summary": "Cutting to the chase -- this amp simply sounds amazing.

I've used phosphor bronze (preferred, 20 years) with an occasional 80/20 bronze thrown in.  I really was hoping the Monel's would project more bass response.  They do not, they kind of reduce the thump actually (more lower range response with age), bronze alloys definitely have more bottom range.  The Monels tend to round out the guitar a little better.  They give more \"old school\" country jangle and allow for more \"overtones\".  As far as generating \"woody\" sound, I definitely hear it.  When I first put them on, I thought of grandma's old piano with what i'm guessing had Monel strings as it didn't have new strings since the '70's.  I don't know about the \"smooth\" description, I would say the give it more a mid range bump & jangle.  I put them on a straight braced Standard D-28 and they took a few days to break in.  I generally liked them the first day, and better as they aged.  It's been 2.5 weeks and I intend to replace with some of my on stock phosphor bronze to see the difference again after break-in and use, but all ready intend to start using the Tony Rice/ Monel with regularity in the future.  Absolutely worth a try or occasional experiment.  You definitely need to give them a few weeks to break in and give that used string kind of tone.", "summary": "Give them a try!", "unixReviewTime": 1411430400}

I opted for this one based on reviews and price.\n\nSet-up is straightforward, and if you go on youtube you will find a few videos that show just how easy it is. Out of the box the mic has about the same gain as a wired SM58. If you expose the battery compartment in the mic you will find a gain adjustment that when maxed makes this mic very hot (sound wise).\n\nThe mic has some handling noise near the butt end, but is otherwise relatively quiet. I would put the sound quality on par with an SM58, and this is easily the same sound quality as Shure's much more expensive UHF handheld mic and received solution.\n\nI would love to make claims about distance, but frankly would be lying because not of the venues in which we perform is over 30x50 feet. So I cannot validate the 300 feet claim. I will say that this system has zero static and crystal clear voice reproduction that is not biased towards any particular part of the frequency spectrum.\n\nAbove I mentioned that I evaluated Shure, GTD and Audio-Technica. It has near identical performance as Shure (but nowhere near the price tag) and Audio-Technica (same rice range and I almost went that way). The GTD solutions were significantly less expensive and I was also tempted to opt for that brand, but it has no way of setting the mic gain on the mic itself. Plus the company did not appear to have the track record of the others. When it came down to this or the Audio-Technica it was - honestly - a coin toss. You cannot go wrong with either.\n\nAs for mic holders, the mics are much larger than regular mics and will not fit a standard mic holder like those for SM58s and similar.

These don't have the familiar thumbscrew, but that's okay (it turns out); numerous reviews cite this design is an improvement (I can vouch for this now). The illustration and limited instructions threw me for a bit. Here's a better explanation:\n\n1) Align the hole north/south (pointing up to the end of the headstock),\n2) Lock the string into place by turning the top portion of the post until it clicks,\n3) Thread the string and pull it tight without turning the post, and\n3) Turn the tuning knob. The top of the post is not supposed to turn in unison with the bottom portion of the post. It'll look like the top post isn't moving for about half a turn, this is how you know the lock is being put on and the string is clamped in place. To test, turn it a little more after the top post starts moving in unison. If locked, you won't be able to pull the string loose from the machine.\n\nOnce I figured out how to properly string the instrument using these tuners, I tested their effectiveness. They work great, as well as or better than their predecessors.

I've never owned a classical guitar because I didn't want to spend a lot of money on something I might not play very often, and have been unimpressed by those I've played in this price range. However, I took a chance since Washburns are generally decent-enough guitars.\n\nI made the right choice. It's well worth the budget price for an above average budget guitar, and I've ended up playing it quite often.\n\nCONS:\n1. Its top color. It's probably the official guitar of the Syracuse University Orange football team - but it's acceptable.\n2. \"Dipped finish\" appearance. It's super-glossy and a little thick, although not as thick as some other inexpensive guitars.\n3. Fret edges are protruding and sharp, they need to be filed.\n\nPROS:\n1. Back and side wood is attractive.\n2. Tuner is accurate and comes with 9-volt battery included.\n3. Heavy 9-foot cord included for connection to amp.\n4. Stays in tune once strings stabilize after initial multiple tunings.\n5. For me, action was a little high at first, but was adjusted to \"just right\" and is easily played.\n6. If not played side-by-side with guitars costing hundreds more, it sounds pretty good. Decent volume.\n7. Plugged-in sound is nice \"flat\", but EQ adjustments don't hurt.\n8. Nubone (not CHEAP plastic) nut and saddle.\n9. Wasburn is a better and better-looking guitar (with better brand recognition) than the no-name classical guitar I saw at Costco for about the same price as this one's sale price ($150): Costco guitar looked cheap and wasn't cutaway or electric like the Washburn, although it played OK and didn't have sharp, protruding fret edges.\n\nIn conclusion, there'll be no buyer's remorse with this Washburn.", "summary": "Most Satisfying Classical I've Played In This Price Range", "unixReviewTime": 1408579200}

To be honest, I was very, very impressed with their feel and handling. I do think they're the best playing strings I've used when it comes to pure playability. Hands down, none better. They were butter-smooth and great for flat picking. But for me it was a trade-off, because I simply wasn't impressed with the tone. I even took the time to try them on three different guitars (all dreadnoughts): a classic maple sides/spruce top, a mahogany back/sides with spruce top, and a maple backs/sides with a nato top. On all three, I didn't like the tone as much as the strings I was using. I really wanted to like them, but they simply didn't have the tone of the medium gauge Martin SPs I normally use.\n\nThis isn't to say they're not great strings that sound different on other peoples' guitars, but I simply didn't like them on mine. I love good projection with rich bass tones and ringing treble for the folk and traditional music I play in our jam group. The Elixirs just lacked the punchy high tones of the Martin strings I use, and the treble sounds tinny vs. the clear ring of the Martins I normally use. To be fair, the bass strings sound great, and aren't much different. I would have to say choose your strings carefully based upon how you're going to use them. I play in acoustic groups, and the Elixir strings just don't have what I need to be heard, in spite of how great they feel under your fingers. If playability is more important than great tonal range, then by all means buy these strings...you won't be disappointed.

For bands who are just getting started, or churches using volunteers to control their sound boards, automated feedback suppression is the way to go.\n\nAutomated feedback suppression is something that \"listens\" to the feed coming in to the mixer/sound board. In the chain of connections, this piece of hardware typically sits between the sound board/mixing board and the speakers. A cabling and configuration diagram is included, and is also available on the Harmon/dbx website.\n\nThe package does not include cables (most audiophiles will have preferred cables anyway, so it's best they let the customer choose which connectors they prefer).

Midi in and out on the back. 4 Insert in/outs, 4 main outs (bal/unbal), 4 record outs, phone jack and RCA. back on the front has 4 volume controls and green and red (clip) led's. It feels like a sturdy metal box and is well laid out. It is small but every square inch is utilized. Looks very professional, not toyish or like a car battery charger.

Other than occasionally adjusting the gain knobs when I see the clip light blinking, it just sits there and does it's job. With my usual buffer settings I get 10 mil sec of latency delay. That's round trip latency. I can easily live with that. There is no noticeable latency on input. I'm driving my CPU at around 30% with the Pro 7 DAW.  With the Reaper about 15%. There are no pops or glicks, and if it happens I'll adjust the buffer accordingly. I plan to move up to more channels soon, but until then this little thing works great.

I think everyone knows the story that some boutique pedal company was buying the joyo ultimate drive, re painting them and selling them for 200... That is because even though they cost around 25 to 30 bucks the quality of sound and construction is sooooooo freaking good.... There are a few haters of course... Not even the major brands are immune to that.... But back to the review of this AC Tone pedal.... Again, I wish all I had to say was WOW! But I'll continue and describe how great this amp pedal is.... There are multiple ways you can use this pedal... Hook it up directly to your soundcard to record and get an amazing mic'd amp tone... And I do mean TONE! You can hook it up to a mixer or pa system directly in a love situation and get that warm amazong VOX tone as well... Now this other option... The one I use the most is I place this stompbox at the end of the signal chain of the FX loop on my amp... That is to bypass the pre amp of the amp head and that way it's extremely quiet and it gives a better , richer , warmer tone.... I could hook it up in front of the amp as well... Nothing wrong with that of you don't mind a little extra noise... And it's very little but noticeable... If you do this the controls seem to be more responsive than the effects loop option but you do sacrifice a little quitness in your signal....\n If you place this pedal in front of your amp . Please don't  conplain that is noisey... Because you are basically purting a pre amp in front of another pre amp... That's just how it is. So I think that if you put this on the effects loop bypassing the amps pre amp... You will get the best results....  Now, they are a little subtle... This stompbox is best suited for people who are obssessed with getting the best tone possible, therefore you have to have a good ear and be patient and tweek the sound to perfection... If you think that you will get this out of the box and get the sound of the Vox AC 30 immediately ... I think it's an unrealistic expectation... But if you take the time to tweek both your amp and this pedal you wipl get an amazing smooth warm tone that will be noticeable by anyone and everyone who hears you playing.... Everytime I play out... People comment how good my guitar sounds... But it has to do more with this pedal than anythinf else... Absolute brilliant... Get it if you can! And you will not regret it... I read some hate saying that they are poorly constructed, or that they are not trie bypass, or that they suck b cause they are made in china and they are cheap... These people assume that and I think it even affects them in a subliminal level that this oedal cannot be that great if it's obly 30 dlls.... But in fact it's probably one of the best am simulators on the planet.... I also own the american sound , and brittish sound.... Both equally great... If this is the first joyo pedal you have checked out.... You really need to take a look at their ultimate overdrive.... It's ridiculously awesome.... Thanks ...

I understand due to its small size it wouldn't sound as full as my tenor or even my concert, but its plinky enough that it sounds a bit on the cheap side.\nThe carry bag is as cheaply made as they could go. Its a lightweight meshy fabric and I bet the zipper they put in it cost more than the whole rest of the bag to make. Its not going to protect your uke at all. If you're travelling with it, invest in a better bag or case.\n\nOTHER\n\nIts a little hard to fret because of its small size. I don't know how people can play the even smaller size (sopranino) that's recently come out. That's no fault of the instrument though and something I will likely get used to and then it won't be an issue.\nI've found my first uke to be the \"gateway instrument\"- As of now, I have 3 ukes, a banjolele, and have some other thrift store finds being shipped to me.

On first sight, these are better looking and once I put this Golden Gate pick on my thumb, the EB picks went in the trash. Why? These are better fitting for my thumb, they are a touch smaller than the EB picks.  I like my thumb picks fairly tight. There's something about the contour of these picks that's more thumb anatomical than the Balls or Dunlops. Most key, these are with a slightly textured material, so they stay put and do not rotate; much better than the Ernie Balls or the Dunlop picks that I've used in the past, especially when hands get sweaty. Some of this ability to stay secure has to do with the matte finish of these picks, as opposed to the slippery plastic of the Competitors. Note: Golden Gate also makes a Confetti thumbpick, and one called Pearloid; although I've never seen either in person, from the photos they appear smoother looking, as though they might move more in the thumb. I'm sticking with Ivoroid.\n\nI like my thumb picks short, and had no issues filing these down, just as I do with my EB picks.\n\nSo glad I tried these on a whim.

I REALLY would like to buy one of these in royal blue leather (EDIT - They are available from the manufacturer direct in Blue. The price more than doubles however...)\n2 - the adjustment buckle offers the potential to dig in to you and/or scratch your guitar (its plastic but...yeah.)

They last well, I've had a few for several years.\n\nThese are ten times nicer than the cheap 2\" nylon straps...don't \"fret\" (pardon my pun) the $55 cost.

I have 6 intelligent DMX lights connected to my OBEY40 right now and the unit seems to be working perfectly.  I can control up to twelve different lights (I only can afford 6) and the slide channels are smooth to operate.  In fact, everything so far with the unit works just as it should.\n\nNOTE: Do not even attempt to purchase a DMX controller unless you know how to use one, or are willing to spend a few hours reading the instructions.  I watched a few uTube videos to get me started, then poured myself a beer and read all the manuals.  Remember: you must have your manuals for each of your lights because they explain what each channel does on your DMX controller (You can probably download them if you've lost them).\n\nI gave this unit 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish there were more led lights on the unit to show which scene you're on.  Sometimes it's easy to get lost while switching around in your programs... but maybe I just need some more practice?\n\nWith those warnings being said, it is a MUST to have a DMX controller if you own these type of lights.

I don't know how to explain all of this other than to say there are two quick flashes of light with subtle hints of the the light coming on and shutting off, and then a delay followed by two quick flashes of light with subtle hints of the the light coming on and shutting off followed by a delay, and so on.  It just doesn't look or feel like a true strobe.\n\nI gave the unit two stars because it does appear well-constructed and it's cheap.", "summary": "Not the classic strobe I was looking for", "unixReviewTime": 1282867200}

The second problem is there is no handle on the back of the bag. This puts a lot of stress on the backpack straps, and makes putting on the gig-bag tricky.

The latches are well designed, heavy-duty, and properly secured to the case. The interior is soft and properly cushioned in the right spots. The under-neck stowage area is very standard and what you'd expect. The handle is well placed and ergonomically designed- thicker than average with a nice grippy rubber covering.\n\nThere is a steel band that runs around the sides and splits at the point where the top and bottom meet in order to provide a sealed closure. I found that you do need to sort of line that up with itself as your closing the case to allow all of the latches to close. Its one of those muscle memory things that can seem annoying at first but after doing it 20 times you don't even think about it anymore.\n\nIt also weighs significantly less than the particle board hardshell cases I was used to from Martin. I was pleasantly surprised at how light it was.

I have had the Pocket POD for several days now. I bought it as a companion to my new Traveler Speedster guitar (which I will also review). The Traveler Speedster, for those that don't know, is an electric guitar designed for traveling. When traveling, of course, I don't want to carry an amp around, so the Pocket POD seemed like the perfect solution. Along with the guitar and a small pair of headphones I have everything I need to practice when I am in the hotel room, without bothering anyone.\n\nI opened the Pocket POD as soon as I got it home, put the included batteries in, plugged in my new guitar and some headphones and started playing. Plugging the guitar in automatically turns the POD on (there is no power switch). I never looked at the instructions, I just plugged in and used the 4-way button to change to various sounds. I still have not looked at the instructions, although I did download the companion software and play around with making some of my own sounds. The only knobs I have actually used on the device itself is the 4-way to change presets and the volume knob. I don't even know what the others do, since I have just used the software on my PC for other adjustments. I did use the tuner by holding down the button on the bottom right, which seemed to work fine for me, although someone else complained about it not being a great tuner. I have a fairly good ear and it sounds fine after tuning as far as I can tell.\n\nI have been using the Pocket POD non-stop for about 8 hours. The batteries that came with it are still holding up so far. It has a plug for an AC adapter, but it didn't come with one. For the price, that would have been a nice thing to include.\n\nI think the problem with these kinds of gizmos is that folks expect them to produce sounds as good as stuff that literally costs 10 times as much. It doesn't do that. But what it does do is produce a huge selection of fantastic sounds, right out of the box, and the ability to come up with your own. Given how portable it is, I find it impossible to complain. I don't do gigs (I'm not that good) but I would not hesitate to play through this thing using an amp in front of a crowd. If you are so good that the difference between this device and a more expensive one matters that much then you probably already have something better suited for your situation. Still, I'll bet that it would work for even the best musician in a pinch.\n\nThe ability to pipe in music or other sounds from another device (PC, iPod, phone, anything you can plug headphones into) is a great feature. You might want to pick up an audio extension cable since it doesn't come with one. That is a cable with both ends looking like the end of a headphone cable. You can also make one out of two old pairs of headphones in a pinch. Using the cable, you can play along with your favorite tunes, or if you have an instructional video or something you can hear it while you try the licks being taught.\n\nSome folks have complained about the sounds that try to mimic bands. They say they have never heard of the bands. The website has all kinds of free downloadable user-made sounds, and you can make your own, so if that is not something you are willing to do then this might not be for you.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you are looking for a very portable device that will turn a guitar and a pair of headphones into a mobile sound solution then this may be just what the doctor ordered. There is even an output for playing through an amp, so If you just want to take your custom sound with you to practice in a place that already has equipment this can do that too.\n\nI also saw some complaints about the quality. I have only used the device for about 8 hours so far. When I first opened the box, one of the dials was stiff, but based on another review I figured out that the knob was just pressed in too far and rubbing against the box. I pulled it out just a tiny bit and problem solved. Otherwise, no issues so far. I did download and apply a firmware update that was available on the website pretty soon after I connected it to my computer to create some sounds, so that may have fixed some things. Creating the sounds was pretty straightforward too, by the way.\n\nI suggest you look around and see what other devices can do and, based on your budget and needs, if you land on this thing, get it. It works as advertised, produces great sound, and has some unexpectedly great features. If you are a pro looking for professional quality and sound, I am not sure why you are looking at this, but even so, I believe you will get more than you expect for this price.\n\nIf it breaks or disappoints in any way I will come back and update this review, but as of now, I would highly recommend it. If you see the features and just hope it does what it says it can do, you will not be disappointed.\n\nUPDATE: 6/5/2015 ... Still going strong. Love this thing. I have used it for over a year now and it continues to work like new. I did get some rechargeable batteries and I would recommend it.

I plan to update this review over the next couple of months as my impressions change while having it.  As a brief summary of myself, I'm a moderately skilled and self taught piano player who wanted to get a instrument for my apartment so that I could continue developing and have an outlet for creativity in my home.\n\n7/10/2014:\n\nThe piano arrived yesterday and the box that it arrives in is HUGE (~6 feet long) and extremely HEAVY (~100 lbs)!  Check your machismo, as this box is just too wide and long to get an appropriate grip to hulk it into your own home by yourself--much less up a flight of stairs.  That's my warning if you live in a flat that isn't on the ground floor and has no elevator access--also, if you DO have elevators, check to see if a service lift is available otherwise you may have trouble fitting this box inside a tiny elevator stall with you.  I actually had to assist the UPS delivery guy to get the package off of his truck and into my kitchen--he was a big help and I couldn't have done it without his help.\n\nAssembly wasn't too hard, first of all make sure you have the box with it's label upright before unpacking the items inside.  This will make sure that the actual keyboard unit is easiest to pull out of the box--additionally, the instructions to put together the piano is located in a small packaged cardboard box that can be easy to miss or confuse with the smaller boxes that contain screws or the power cord and adapter.  My best advice when unboxing is that you remove all of the items from the main box first, set the wooden frames and foot pedals in one corner of the room, the keyboard unit in another corner, and the manuals/screws in another.  Then repack the styrofoam protectors back into the box and save one last corner for the bubble wrap/bags/packing tape to throw away later.  When you start construction, you'll build around the foot pedals, so the area/corner should have plenty of room and be well lit to work on the front and back of the piano.  Lastly, I recommend keeping the box if you have the room as taking apart the keyboard isn't too complicated (in retrospect) and is a potentially safer option than moving the piano whole later on.\n\nAfter putting together the keyboard, plugging it in, and starting to play, I have to say that the sound is terrific.  The digital piano not only emulates notes but also the background sounds of the inner workings of the piano including the dull hammer strikes and accompanying resonance of nearby keys.  It's very easy to forget that you're not actually playing on an actual piano.  However, when you do remember, it's a bit of a audio/sensory dissonance.  At certain times of lucidity, it'll feel like your just calling a person over the phone who's playing the exact same notes you're attempting to play using a piano-shaped block of wood.  It almost sounds too good, too full-bodied, for what you've got in front of you.  It's only been a day, but I've caught myself on more than four occasions checking the sides of the piano to remind myself how thin it is but how resonant it sounds.  I imagine this is something I'll get used to.\n\nI'll conclude with some issues, there's a definitive learning curve regarding how to truly appreciate the features this digital piano offers.  Two tone layering, duet mode, adjusting brightness, and learning how to incorporate my USB stick all made for a very overwhelming experience.  The biggest issue is that the display only works by paying attention to a couple of red flashing lights/beeps, which makes it hard to know what mode your in or what signal went through.  This is something that will certainly take time to wrap my head around as I've never had to learn such a system for a piano and my personal keyboards have the advantage of an informative LCD display, which this device lacks.  I also noted that certain keys that perform useful functions (such as transposing) are not labeled and must be committed to memory or left as an item to consult in the manual.  In fact, as much as I was pleased to have the music book, the piano manual has yet to left the music stand and I continue to reference it.  I imagine with extended familiarity this will be smaller challenge.\n\n8/7/2014\n\nI've now owned this piano for about a month.  Let's see, my immediate impressions after going back to my old upright is that that the Casio PX850 provides a substantially improved playing experience.  I would list the improvements thusly:\n\n+This Casio provides me all of the benefits of an authentic piano sound(s) without having to worry about all of the long-term issues that come typical with an actual piano.  Things like notes going out of tune, broken hammers, dented felts, keys that get stuck in the down position, inner dust collecting, broken strings, etc. are all comfortably forgotten issues now.\n+It's fun to play for hours, then kick up the transpose a couple of notes and replay the same songs and have the sound feel completely different without having to learn or struggle with different scales.  It's just a great way to play for fun.\n+The keys are the length of a grand.  I never noticed this feature but I really appreciate the extra space for my large hands.\n+I can adjust the mellow/brightness of the piano on the fly.\n+There's always a clear unmuddled sound emanating from the PX850 even on full sustain.\n+Headphones are great!\n+The speakers are situated just underneath the notes, when you play, the keys actually vibrate just like a real piano.  The feeling is completely uncanny.\n\n-Yeah, the lower register keys with higher tension will clack when you play them hard.  Can't be heard at past 45% volume.  Not sure if this was a first day \"issue\" but I noticed it fairly recently.  Doesn't really bother me.  It's not really an overpower sound, but I know this very same noise has annoyed a bunch of other customers.\n-All of the features are still nebulous to me.  I can record onto the Piano or the USB, and I can transfer songs from the USB to my computer, but I can't transfer songs I record on the Piano to the USB (or at least I don't know how yet).  There's also a bunch of very nuanced things I can do like change the tempermant of the piano and I've yet to touch duet mode.  So far I've been just happy enough plugging in the machine, turning it own, belting out a few songs, then turning it off and unplugging it.  The fancy stuff hasn't really been a selling point to me.  Surprisingly, I haven't even used all of the different sounds yet.\n-The piano has a giant CASIO PX850 logo plastered on the back in white.  This won't bother you if your Casio is up against a wall, but mine is actually isn't and it's a shame seeing such a high contrast text plastered on my black cabinet.  I was hoping that only labels on the machine I had to deal with were the ones on the front next to the ominous red lights I can't turn off.\n-Can't turn the red lights off?  Shame.  I wish they just sort of shut off after a few seconds.\n\nOverall, this unit out performs my previous upright piano.  I'm upgrading the review to a four until I become more familiar with the more advanced controls.\n\n10/14/2014\n\nApparently I screwed up when posting my long September review.  So just to summarize, the piano is still holding up very well. I've upgraded to a 32 GB USB to further explore the recording options, and overall I'm still highly satisfied.  As far as cons go, I think the number of red lights that are on at the same time are a little excessive, but I never notice them when I'm playing.  Still happy with this purchase and the piano is holding up well even under very forceful strikes and regular use for about 3 months.\n\n3/7/2015\n\nSo it's been a little over half a year.\n\nHere's my update:\n\nGood points:\n+The piano is still very much in working condition, with minimal wear.\n+My piano playing has improved dramatically\n+The lid is wide enough to rest my old laptop on, which has dramatically increased the utility of recording music\n+I've learned to easily record my play, modify transpose, use dual voice features, adjust the volume of each voice, use the metronome, etc.\n+Everything is still in tune... which, I mean, is expected for an electronic instrument--but still, kudos, Casio.\n\nBad points:\n-The keys in the octave just above middle C are beginning to creak very slightly.  I can certainly hear a greater give in the keys I routinely play compared to the keys I don't.  It's way more disconcerting that it is actually distracting.  I can't hear it when I play, or with the headphones on, but when the piano is turned off and I press the keys I can make out definitive differences in keys I've played a lot on vs keys I haven't.\n-Sometimes I'll try to record a song and only realize after I've finished playing and moved the USB to my computer to view the waveform that I wasn't recording while I was playing.  I've had this instrument for a 3/4ths of a year and I'm still having an issue with the unintuitive feedback user interface.  Maybe I'm just a dummy (trust me, I'm not counting that out) but seriously, there should have just been a single dedicated red button you push to record and you push again to stop recording. Instead, to record, I have to push a button called AUDIO SETTINGS then wait while the lights next to AUDIO RECORDER and SONG RECORDER buttons flash five times, which means it's reading my USB drive (obviously, right?), then I push AUDIO RECORDER again and then a yellow light comes on for SONG RECORDER and the AUDIO RECORDER red light will flash once and then (hopefully) it will record whatever I play next--UNLESS if it completely refreshes my piano settings to the default settings.  Also if the red button next to AUDIO RECORDER keeps flashing, you pushed it too many times and have to push it again so it only flashes once so it starts recording.  I mean seriously.  I have a 15 year old YAMAHA keyboard that records with just a one button press and stops when you press it again.  It cost $30 bucks. It's something that still frustrates me.", "summary": "Will update review over the next couple of months", "unixReviewTime": 1404950400}

Different price points give you different features and more inputs including independent channels for each, but the sound is the same. This board sounds every bit as good as my Mackie CR-1604 that was eight times the price of this board. Plug a mic in and sing through it and hear the deep solid one that Mackie is famous for. Even their vocal plate reverb for voice is just right.\nI was shocked that Mackie made a board this cheap. They also have a ProFX12 which is twice the money and has a USB and a proper power supply. It also has 6 mic pres with their own EQ's instead of 4. The list goes on. You could actually run a small band through this Mix12FX with some microphones, a keyboard plugged in, and even a guitar or two that had their own effects pedals, or effects sends from amps.\n\nThe limitation on any one of these lowest priced boards is that they share faders on the additional channels. So the first 4 have dedicated EQ, and the MixFX-12 has three band EQ but the other channels don't, and they split the fader into a stereo so one fader controls two channels; they share the same fader. An argument could be made that you can pan those additional channels hard right, or left and have a dedicated fader, but then you would lose the other channel that it shares. With a center position on the fader you have two separate channels that go up and down the same on one fader. No independent levels for each. My CR-1604 Mackie has separate faders, EQ, etc. etc. on each channel.\n\nThis Mix12FX does not come with a USB but USB based boards generally only output the final mix. It is not like it is equal to an interface where you can isolate each and every channel in the computer. So the net result is you have one premixed at the settings you have on the board with a single stereo mix only, or you could say it is the main outs only.\n\nEveryone talks about the pop when you start it up, and the fact that there is no power switch. My Adcom MKIII power amps from the 70 which are high end amps all pop. I grew up with amps popping so it is not a big deal to me. However the instructions state that you should plug in/turn on the mixer with all levels turned down, and no instruments plugged in before you turn on your amp. If you are a performing band and going on break, just slide down the main outs and leave it on. Also a switched power strip is a good idea, or in line switch. You are saving a bundle on this mixer, it is unbelievably cheap especially considering you are getting 12 channels while still maintaining the classic Mackie quality. This board sounds every bit as good as my CR-1604.\n\nI recently purchased the Behringer XENYX X1832 for about two and a half times the price of the Mix12 Mackie, and it has a ton of bells and whistles including EQ's on all the channels (6 dedicated independent channels with Mix pres with shared EQ on the others) with an additional 9 band graphic EQ for the final mix or monitors, yes it has USB and the list goes on. I had originally ordered a 12 channel but I did a lot of research, and some of the reviews stated that they did eventually have some problems with some of the channels. So the advice was when dealing with cheaper boards especially one that gives you so much for so little, get more channels than you need so if one or two fails you still have enough of them to get the job done.\n\nMackie is known for excellence, and my CR-1604 that I bought in the 80's still works perfectly with no problems whatsoever. They are generally more expensive than the competition and are better built so I was surprised to see this Mix12 giving you so much for so little.\nPersonally I plan on using this as an easy carry around mixer for open mic night. I can plug a drum machine, a mic into it, my guitar effects pedal, and my keyboards etc. and then hand the house PA sound guy a single output that is coming from the effects send to plug into the PA. That's a line out signal which is the level you want for sub mixer setups. That way I have control over my tone and reverb and volume levels for the right mix. Then I tell them to just set the fader to the proper volume level and leave the EQ, effects etc. out of it as in just set it flat. I'm not a control freak I just know that tone settings etc. can make the difference between a lousy sounding performance and a great one. So why leave it up to someone else who might even be in the bag when he is playing with it, and may not even care or worse. :-)\n\nI wanted to wait until I tried it out for sound quality before I bought a carrying case, but this one is a winner for sure. I bought the Gator cases Pro G Mixerbag 1212 which is 12x12x5 inches. It fits it like a glove. If you didn't know any better you would think Gator made is especially just for this mixer. It tucks into place it is that perfect of a fit and won't wiggle around at all with its padded sides and edges. It also has an extra zipped in pouch for carrying cords etc.\n\nSo if you are looking for a small, inexpensive, incredibly lightweight and portable mixer for your smaller band, or for a solo performing musician, or even as a playback mixer for your home studio into powered speakers etc. this is a great choice. The Mackie Pro FX12 for almost twice the price with separate EQ on all the channels, and 6 mic pres on independent channels is even better yet and is currently the Amazon number one seller.

For $15 I took a chance and as you can see from my included photos it definitely holds the mic.\n\nThe mic stand is of average lightweight quality but the joints feel nice and sturdy and no tightening was needed at the main joints. Movement is solid and smooth and once you lock down the moving joints it's quite sturdy. As you can see from my included photos it easily holds the mic at a 45 degree angle, vertical, and inverted with no noticeable sag (although it does have a slight play at the mic attachment point which doesn't really cause much issue.)\n\nThe stand doesn't have full swivel movement but it definitely has enough back and forth movement to adjust it to your liking. Take note that the stand itself is of a smaller size with the length of the arm from one joint to another at about 14.5\". Also the base where it clamps down opens to roughly 1.75\" so make sure that your desk isn't overly thick. The stand does comes with an adapter so that you can mount the Yeti with no problems.\n\nOverall, for the price it's a great stand. Since it pretty easily holds the heavy Yeti, it should be even better for smaller, lighter mics (NOTE: I recently purchased the AT2020USB as well and it works well with this mic as well.) The main reason I purchased this was to get rid of the slight knocking noise the Yeti would pick up from my keyboard/mouse use and this stand has essentially eliminated this, even with the stand clamped on the same desk. Great stand, great price, would definitely recommend.

I do live sound for roughly 2-3 events each month, and I carry with me quite a few cables to each event cuz you'll never know what you may need more at each site.  The problem is the long xlr cables can be quite heavy, quite easy to get tangled, quite confusing to deal with when you have to use lots of them, and are time consuming to roll up (especially those of length 30-50').\n\nSince I found these, I have left most of the longer xlr cables at home to lighten up my cable loads.  My typical live setup would have 8 powered speakers divided into 3 groups (main left, main right, monitors), and running 8 set of xlrs and keeping them nicely organized on stage is tough.\n\nNow I would run 3 of these snakes (either 10' or 20') from my mixer out, 1 for each group.  Then have a 15' xlr from the end of each snake to individual speaker.  The stage now looks much cleaner, and the shorter end 15' xlrs are much easier to roll up.  If I need to cover more distance, I just use more snake as needed (it's why I bought 3x 20' and 6x 10' snakes)\n\nThe only issue I believe you'll encounter with any cable is how long it'll last with tugging and pulling, and the end connectors of this snake are not built to last.  So I opened up all 8 connectors and dropped in a generous amount of hot glue to keep the wirings together, as well as serving as extra welding.  Just drop in the hot glue, then quickly close the connector back the way it was, before the hot glue harden.\n\nBtw, the monoprice instrument cable does come with hot-glue reinforcement, which I was pleasantly surprised to find, so you won't have to do the hot glue for those like you have to do for these snakes.", "summary": "Very affordable snake.

The reason pickups by Fishman and Baggs are expensive is because they have impedance buffering and other processing built in, which they mis-label \"pre-amps\" perhaps to confuse us innocent musicians, because piezo pickups have plenty of gain already and don't require any more pre-amplification - what they do require is an impedance buffer or impedance transformer. The piezo material itself is apparently dirt cheap. These and similar PUs have an ultra-hi-impedance output signal at 10 million ohms (that's like radio waves - which is why the processor is best very close to the PU so as not to pick up radio waves on the cable, which can happen with some processors) which has to be processed down to a much lower impedance in order to feed the lower-impedance inputs on most amps and mixers.\n\nIf you try to use this pickup without the appropriate signal processor, you will have a tone with excessive high frequencies and little bass, and you will have to use multiple levels of EQ to get it to sound anything like acceptable. This is the reason for the bad reviews, when people say \"this thing sounds horrible!\". Yes it does, unprocessed.\n\nThe processor in question needs to have an input impedance of 10 or 20 M-ohms (millions of ohms) and an output impedance (to connect to amp or mixer) of something several orders of magnitude lower, like 600 ohms (mic level) or 10 k-ohms (line level).\nThe box Behringer sells for about 25 bucks has an input impedance of only about 1 M-ohm, not enough (check the specs).\nThe Boss AD-2 works well (and I am using it), for a hundred bucks. It's the most cost-effective solution. I think it probably works for _any_ instrument with a piezo PU.\nFishman and Baggs make boxes that are supposed to work, according to the specs, for about 300 bucks. I tried one Fishman model and returned it for various reasons - too expensive, didn't like the proprietary power supply, ate 9v battery in two hours, etc.\nGrace Designs makes some for a thousand bucks or so. Probably pretty nice! Guess maybe I'll never know!\n\nSo, this pickup is almost free compared to the processor you need, but it will sound really lousy unless you have something to plug it into with an ultra-hi-impedance input. Read the specs on your gear.\n\nNow, these pickups are cheaply wired and the connection in the jack will break easily. This is a solder job requiring a new jack, but no big deal. Also the plastic clam-shell housing for the pickup can crack apart easily. If it does, put it back together with cyano acrylate glue. No problem.\n\nI am actually using two of these wired in parallel to the same jack, a DIY job. I took the housings apart and filled them with epoxy to prevent the solder joints breaking. Although I cannot explain the technical reason, this actually improved the sound of the unprocessed signal - but not enough to not need an impedance buffer.", "summary": "Understanding impedance levels is the key; signal processor necessary.", "unixReviewTime": 1491091200}

I heard people complaining about it being off when harmonizing. that is actually the pedal staying true to where the other notes are, it won't brake ranks to make your playing easier, you need to realize how it is harmonizing and that makes the different settings work with different notes of the scale. the detune is so lovely, that has been a favorite sound of mine for years and on this pedal it sounds nice, watery and deep. I have added this to my chain of effects and with a chorus pedal, ehx cathedral reverb, distortion pedal, and an analog delay on the way, I can now pick and choose what to add to my setup. this isn't too expensive and if you play beautiful music it creates some great sounds to solo with over your chords. it can also drop tuning to bass simulator that sounds cool, if not exactly like a bass, it is still deep and cool sounding. you will have moments of enjoying a sound and going off on a tangent, that is called inspiration. lastly, it drops tuning to real death metal, gooey metal territory. I can see metal heads loving the sound of it, cause it is real deep and clean, like godflesh stuff. the 12 string sound you can create is really nice too, go dual and have the octave lower and higher AND your source sound  mixed at like 50% and it sounds really nice. with the blend all the way over the notes sound good and playing chords like that sounds real and not too artificial.

I purchased this model, and after the second time I used it, I had songs that I didn't have to do any editing to. They sounded clear, with no distortion, and you could hear each distinct instrument. We play loudly with a lot of distortion, and I set the recorder up toward the back of the room on a camera tripod (it has a hole for the mounting bracket) and I raised it up fairly high. I am VERY happy with the recordings that I've gotten. The interface on the actual recorder takes a little bit to get used to, but once you do, it's not too complicated.\nJust as a side note, right before I purchased this I bought the Tascam iM2W, that is a microphone that attaches to an older iPhone, and you can download a Tascam app to make your phone into a portable recorder. It sounded awful, and I couldn't get the software to work correctly, or record for more than a few minutes at a time. I only spent $15 on it, and I'm sure it would work for some people, but definitely not what I was looking for.", "summary": "VERY happy with this!", "unixReviewTime": 1459728000}

I give it a 5/5 for what it is, not to imply that it is one of the best out there.\n\nPros (for me)\n- Good sound\n- Good headroom\n- Low distortion\n- Low noise\n- DI is good for bass and electric guitar\n- Balanced in/out\n- Useful VU meter\n- Useful send/return\n- Headphone monitoring\n- Notched Gain + Linear trim\n\nCons (for me)\n- Big and ugly\n- The space is spent on all-in-one kind of stuff. If you just want the preamp, get the 2 channel 1U rack.\n- I wish they made this unit in a full 1U rack unit with all the same inputs/outputs\n- No TRS output. XLR output only\n\nI use it for vocals, acoustic guitar, and electric bass. It handles everything very well. No complaints on pre-amp performance.\n\nThis design may be useful to put in a sound booth if the performer wants to monitor themselves and the cue mix from the engineer. In a big studio they're likely to have all that hardware in the monitoring room, but for smaller studios and home studios, this could be a useful tool. For the monitoring room it's a big box that gets in the way. I'd much rather have a 1 or 2 channel full 1U rack version of this, but I do appreciate it as a standalone box for practicing DI instruments or testing mics.\n\nThis is a step up from my other cheaper preamps. If you are on the SM7 bandwagon, then yes, it is powerful and clean enough for that mic. But don't think that \"clean\" means there is no amp his at all. At 50db Gain I measure an average (across the freq spectrum) noise level of -100dB RMS in my DAW. This is quite good.\n\nMake sure you use balanced inputs. You'll need a female XLR to male TRS to put the output of the preamp into the line input of your A/D converter. You can go straight XLR to your mic input, but you may get different sounds and distortion levels. Use line input if you can and make sure to adjust the gain on your input device to unity gain (different for every device and every pot).", "summary": "A solid Preamp with lots of extra features", "unixReviewTime": 1384992000}

(Or even direct into the PA)\n\nThe Fly Rig 5 has totally answered the call.  I take the guitar out from the synth, through some pedals into the fly rig, remix it with the synth and run that through an eventide H9 to a pair of QSC K10s or the PA, and have managed to dial in some great guitar tones that get lots of compliments from other musicians.\n\nBasically I use the SANSAMP section as a clean fenderish amp that sounds great by itself or being pushed by pedals and the PLEXI section as a \"dirty channel\" that also sounds great being pushed by pedals.  The PLEXI \"hot\" control happily is INDEPENDENT of the PLEXI channel, so SANSAMP plus HOT is a great clean lead sound.  And my RAT and my Wah, and my Overdrive, and my Compressor all sound great through both clean and dirty channels.  I then set up the tap tempo DLA section for a nice short \"thickening\" delay and route the output through the H9 for sfx... and YEA!...\n\nIMHO, best for the size direct sound, lots of foot controllable variety, and ALL in a REALLY small package...

Sure enough this amp seems like the real deal.\nIt was plain to see that the carton had been dropped on one corner so i was a bit worried but the inner packing was quite good and absorbent as it should be as it traveled a long ways to get to my house.\n\nI saw enough on the demo video that i was able to put the amp through most of its paces without reading the manual, but if you are not familiar with tube amps i would read it first and do some google homework...actually for just about any guitar amp you've never owned or played before.  The three channels are all very good and each one has a variety of tones available.  If you like a more metal sound then the stock tubes are geared towards that although the clean channel is surprisingly crisp and sounds great.  I bought the bugera 212K  140 watt cab to go with it and they sound great together. Because I prefer classic rock and blues to metal i changed a few preamp tubes and a couple of power tubes with some i had lying around.  No bias required! Now that is amazing.  There was a nice improvement with each change I made for my tone preferences, and again I was pleasantly surprised. i have 3 distinctly different channels now. For me I like the Humbucker tone from my Les Paul and my Telecaster Thinline the best. If you are thinking about this amp I cant really see any reason to not to try it.\n\nHopefully the infinium technology will stand the test of time. My metal head son thinks its awesome too.  It sounds just perfect at any volume.  Now I will be selling a couple of other tube amps I have and keeping this one.  Bugera makes awesome amps for GAS folks on a budget. My V22 is also awesome.  Apparently swapping the rectifier tubes for the modern smaller JJ's is supposed to also be an improvement.  So the thing I like is that it sounds great as is, plus it can sound better if you upgrade it as your budget permits. I had an amp I wanted to upgrade and make work and I spent a lot of money on it trying to do that and nothing i tried really got it to sound as good as this amp does right out of the box.

It has great tone and sustain, the neck is fast and wide making it easier to play, especially if you have big hands.

After using the TWO independent battery conservation modes on the 661 (turn off the leds and minimize the big display from 5 rows to just one row of data) the jumpy current waveform settled down to 315 mA DC +/- 15 mA.  For battery usage, you can use a 315mA draw for conservative recording power usage estimates.  So that perspective users of the 661 can get a feel for it I've uploaded 5 most often seen sample screenshots with notes in the pictures section above.  The notes cover what each screen does and how the function keys work.  The instruction manual shows you how to wire pushbuttons and resistors to the 4 terminal remote plug which is VERY hard to find (most are 3 terminal - left/right/ground) - you can use the 3 terminal because the only 2 points you need are ground and the tip, but here is the 4 pin version for $0.28 on amazon&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/6FT-3-5-mm-to-3-RCA-AV-Camcorder-Video-Cable-Sony-JVC-6/dp/B000I1D0BW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">6FT 3.5 mm to 3 RCA AV Camcorder Video Cable Sony JVC 6</a>&nbsp;with this cable and the instructions in the manual you can build your own remote with LEDs and extended switches beyond the marantz remote from the PMD660&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Marantz-RC600-Mic-Mount-Remote-Control/dp/B0017OF2OW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Marantz RC600 Mic Mount Remote Control</a>&nbsp;which could be operated by computer or other automated systems.  Basically the 4 terminal plugs are becomming more common now.  The resistor values chosen for pushbutton operation are common values and easy to find.\n\nUPDATE 8-2010:\n\nI've put alot of hours on my PMD661, made a custom case for it, and now I must report a MINOR negative about a whole class of products (the 661, the H4n, certain flashlights, etc)\n\nWhile doing flashlight testing on the Fenix TK-40, 'Menace' pointed out that it seemed to drain AA batteries without being used AT ALL while a similar light, the TK30 did not.  I confirmed his findings using an inline ampmeter - a small amount of power was flowing with the light turned off.  As I measured other products that used the AA NiMH cell, the problem proved to be a bigger issue than just one flashlight.\n\nThis \"trickle\" power is just like your car - leave it in a garage at the airport for 30 days and don't expect the battery to be full when you return.  The amount is small, but placing a plastic strip between a battery and the spring then routing it out of the battery compartment will stop the power from flowing.  The \"off\" power is higher on the PMD661 because it has a timer and can turn itself on for play or record functions with preprogrammed times which other recorders can not do.\n\nUpdate 9-12-2009 - I just returned from a cruise ship using the 661.  I used a Canon hs-10 avchd camera for capturing the main stage video and the 661 to plug into the ship's mixing board for audio.  The ship's audio engineer was excited to see the 661 and hapily pulled out an XLR patch cord set to give me the house mix line level out, which was recorded in the same lossless format (24bit/48 khz) used by the camcorder audio making synchronization in adobe premiere pro a breeze.  The final benefit was hearing the show audio as it left the mixing board to the amps instead of being picked up by the camera set on a tripod in the audience full of echo and laughter, clapping etc.  The final production to blu-ray disc sounded like I was right on stage with the camera.  The marantz ALC circuit performed better than expected and prevented digital clipping while maximizing dynamic range.  End of edit.\n[ACTUAL PRODUCT REVIEW BEGINS HERE]\n\nWhen Marantz added a line level XLR input that bypassed the microphone preamps as opposed to just a mic level input in the 660 (prior model) I finally jumped at it.  Since I work alot of mixing boards I have access to the final stereo mixdown at line level voltages.  Whats the big deal?  Recording at line level gives you 20dB more signal to noise - thats 100 times better for those who don't speak dB - compared to mic level xlr inputs. Also recorders that put an attenuator in front of microphone amplifiers tend to be noisy - marantz is not built this way (the H4n I use for MIC level recordings is - it is not well suited to line level input because it must attenuate the signal to 0.8% before recording it) If you look at your dvd player at home all the outputs are line level simply to get rid of noise.  With such a fabulous recorder, why in the world would you want 100 times more noise in your recordings?\n\nThere are many other factors Marantz did that made the 661 the optimum professional recorder to get - the display is bright and easy to read under all lighting conditions, they used a 1/4\" headphone jack so the little 3.5mm headphones wouldn't pull out at the worst moment (another pro move) - and they improved the case quality.  There is also a digital input for people who are 100% digital already, however it stops at 44.1/48 KHz sampling.\n\nGiven these features, the PMD-661 sits head and antlers above all the other compact recorders out there offering professional connectivity at an economical price.  It's also fully customizable - the bright display is dimmable through 8 steps for indoor club use at night, and it features dual rca line level outputs for analog playback.  About the only thing I would like to have seen would be a worldclock input for synchronizing analog recordings to digital cameras, but the size of the bnc connector would have nixed that option in this handheld product.\n\nPrices are starting to drop - I bought in early but you can save 50 bucks off the original price.

Given the reasonable price, this was an easy purchase to make. Cosmetically these look very nice, not too gaudy and bit machined-looking due to the knurling of the tops. If they offered these without the knurling, but polished to look more jewelry-like I would like that better.\n\nMy two primary concerns were fit and tone, and I'm satisfied with both.  The pins fit my Taylor 714CE perfectly and don't have the tendency to pop out the way my factory-provided ones did. They fit all the way in the pin-holes making a nice tight fit. Because of the way these are machined, you can visually confirm that the flute of the pin is aligned properly with the pin hole even when completely seated.\n\nTone, however, was the primary reason for my purchase and I am very well pleased with the results.  I've analyzed before and after audio files and they visually confirm what my ears are hearing.  There is a 3db increase in sound output (I did not know this was possible from a mere change in pin material), and at the same time the strings are more balanced across the spectrum.  I've not lost any bass, yet the trebles are louder and while the strings still maintain the overall sound of a chord, each string is heard more distinctly at the same time. The waveform confirms that individual strings are more distinct as they stand out on either side of the main frequency spectrum. The sound is less \"mushy\" might be another way of stating it.\n\nYet, this effect is variable depending on how I strum the guitar and I can brush the strings to get them to sound more homogeneous, or bear down on each one to get the effect of each individual note.  Best of all, these pins have not changed the fundamental sound of my Taylor, which I really like and would not stand to lose (much like our sound tech's EQ, for this guitar, which maintains fidelity, and just amplifies it properly).\n\nAll in all I'm pleased and will be ordering more of these for my other guitars.  I can't say if sustain has improved, or diminished, it sounds about the same; however, when doing lead-runs on the G-B-E strings the increased volume is very nice to hear (louder, crisp, bell-like).\n\nI can't be certain, but I believe after many other changes to my Taylor (L.R. Baggs Anthem pickups, D'Addario Phosphor-Bronze Light Strings and decreasing relief with the truss-rod and lowering the saddle height) I finally have the sound I've been working towards for a year now.

For years I've been crawling around behind the racks in my small studio wiring and re-wiring gear every time I want to reconfigure my signal chains. But no longer will I be covered in dust bunnies and spiders, thanks to the S-patch Plus. This thing really is a game changer, especially for those of us less experienced with what can be a rather confusing \"simple\" tool- it's well built and packs a lot of common-sense functionality into a small space.\n\nThe best part about the S-patch is the freedom it gives you to choose Normalled, Half-normalled or Thru functions with the flip of a switch on each input-output pair. This is really convenient, especially if, like me, you're new to patchbays and want to experiment with functionality and signal chain options. The switches are sturdy, as are the jacks and the metal casing of the unit itself- no cheap plastic or thin faceplates here. I've noticed no loss or degradation of signal when tracking or mixing with the unit and I've found the signal flow diagrams printed on the top of the casing to be very helpful as well.\n\nMy only complaint is that the unit doesn't come with Rack Screws, which isn't a huge deal, but it would be nice. It does come with stick-on rubber feet in a little bag, which I'm not using because I have it racked but they would be nice if you had this sitting on a desk. Additionally, some folks have commented on how there isn't much room on the face of the unit for labeling each channel. This is true, but that's the price you pay for a single rack space size unit. I got around this by purchasing a 2 foot long, 1.5\" wide, 1/8\" thick strip of aluminum at the local hardward store for 3 bucks. I used a jigsaw to cut it to ~19\" long like a standard rack unit blank. I drilled out holes in the ends for screws and mounted it just above the S-patch on my rack. Then I stole my wife's labelmaker and created stick-on labels for each piece of gear connected to the patchbay, and stuck them vertically to the aluminum strip. This plate can easily be removed to access the diagrams on the top of the S-patch when you get confused on what the heck-swoggle \"half-normal\" means.\n\nOne word of caution, especially if you're new to this: while any TRS bay will pass phantom power from a preamp to a mic, you run the risk of \"hotpatching\" your mics if you plug in cables while the phantom power is engaged. This can really damage your preamps. If you're really careful, you can get around this by simply never patching a live mic, but this is always going to be a gamble, especially if you're like me and your brain is in 67 places at once during a session. So while it's tempting to put all your preamps \"behind\" the bay, it's better run the output of each pre to a channel of the patchbay which is then normalled to your interface / board. For example, in my studio if I want to plug a mic into an outboard preamp, I use the following chain:\nMic --- xlr patchbay (much safer for phantom than trs) --- Preamp --- S-patch channel normalled to line input on my interface. This means that my mics always run directly to my interface via my outboard preamps UNLESS I break the normal via patch cable. Any phantom power thus flows to the mic from the preamp \"ahead\" of the S-patch. Remember, phantom power flows the opposite direction of mic signal!\n\nOverall, I'm very happy with the S-patch and I already can't imagine my control room without it. It's also already full, so I'll likely buy another soon.", "summary": "Beefy and Easy to Use", "unixReviewTime": 1516492800}

The most noticeable difference between flat wound and round wound strings is the smooth feeling these strings have.  They are very comfortable.  As far as sound goes, I really like the sound but I wouldn't say that there is a stark contrast between these and round wounds.  I am assuming that if you're reading this review and are considering buying these strings, you probably understand the difference between flat wound and round wound.  If you don't, just google it and read up a bit so you know what you're getting.  Supposedly the flat wound strings are a little duller sounding.  I put some flat wounds on my telecaster and I definitely can hear a difference.  With the bass flat wounds, the difference is more subtle.  If you're worried about a drastic change in your sound with flat wounds, you probably don't need to be concerned unless you're an advanced player with a discerning ear (and if you are, then you don't need advice from me).  BUT, I should add that the D'Addario bass strings are \"affordable\" while the guitar strings I bought were Thomastik-Infelds and pricey.  That may explain the difference in what I perceive as change in sound (i.e., the Thomastiks are better quality than D'Addarios).  Is that actually true?  Probably not. But it's worth considering depending on whether you're looking for a change in sound or just some more comfortable strings.  I hope this helps. (I want to clarify I think D'Addarios are fine quality strings that I've used many times before.  I'm just stating differences I've noticed in order to help you decide what to buy.)", "summary": "Nice price for nice strings", "unixReviewTime": 1381622400}

Not just to look at either. It feels beautiful, sounds beautiful and I am in love. I have heard so much talk about Taylors, Martins, Gibsons, Seagulls, etc. I haven't yet had the chance to play those brands but I honestly do not believe they can be any better than this guitar. And to be honest, even if they are I don't really care. This guitar, in my opinion, is absolutely perfect. I came on to Amazon looking for the GIBSON Hummingbird and was prepared to spend over $3,000 for it. Luckily for me I saw this Epiphone Hummingbird first. I know Epiphone is like the poor man's Gibson so I figured I'd try it out and see if I like it before shelling out the big bucks. I now have zero intentions of shelling out those big numbers because to me, this guitar is perfect. I will probably never purchase another guitar for as long as I have the pleasure of owning this one. I have found my soul mate. My one true love and this guitar is she. The guitar arrived ahead of schedule and I live in Bermuda, meaning the guitar first has to be shipped to New York and then shipped again to Bermuda AND (like a normal post office) it usually takes Bermuda two or three weeks to figure out how to get the package from the airport to the city (a 20 minute drive). Never-the-less, it arrived well before time and it was packaged very well (double boxed and padded with extra cardboard and bubble wrap). I was surprised that it was already in tune and playable right out of the box. I expected it to be tuned down so the strings wouldn't be so tight for the trip but it was tuned (and perfectly to standard tuning I might add) right from go. I've had it for a few days now and I just can't seem to put it down. I don't want to put it down. In fact, she is sitting next to me right now as I type this review. If you are looking for an excellent bargain of quality for price, this is it. I highly recommend this guitar to everyone. I would give it a million stars if Amazon didn't limit me to only 5. Actually, I'm not even going to recommend it, I'm going to tell you to buy it (straight up).", "summary": "I'm in Love", "unixReviewTime": 1416182400}

I think I know, the answer, but I'll stay with my original review.\n\nI recorded me on guitar and vocals with both this mic and my laptop's built-in mic.

Quite frankly, I would have reported the results whichever way they went and I was shocked that they were so close. So, I'll live with the 0 of 6. If readers find this experience unhelpful, then so be it.  However, those buying this mic to record guitar and vocal might repeat my experiment to see what happens in their cases.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI'm at a complete loss for how many stars to give.\n\nI purchased this mic to record me--acoustic guitar and vocals.  The mic installed with no issue than taking a few minutes to locate and install the proper drivers. I recorded something.  It sounded fine. I wanted to see how much better it was than my laptop's built-in mic, so I recorded the same clip by using my Asus B23E's built in mic.\n\nThe two clips sound different, but my ears don't prefer one over the other. The AT2020USB+ is a cartiod mic.  It records what's in front of it.  So does my laptop.\n\nSo, how many stars do I award?  It's not that the AT2020 sound bad. It's that the current state of microphone design has these little built-in mics sounding so good.\n\nThis review is based on a particular application that is not terribly demanding.

Both in ease of playing & its overall feel & appearance.\nOne of the more weighty diatonics, it just feels good in one's hand... Just enough heft... very solid.\n\nQuite airtight. Bends fairly easily.\n\nI also own Suzuki Manji harps, and in comparison (tonality being subjective, of course): this is a \"cleaner\", more \"pure\", focused-sounding harp. While not equal-tuned, I prefer to play it for music one usually associates w/equal-tuned harps: melodic pop-rock, lead style, even classical pieces.\nI think of this Promaster as the more formal, luxury, richter-tuned version of the Suzuki Olive (Manji's equal-tuned \"sister\").\n\nThe Manji (with its wide open back & side openings) sounds louder, with an \"organic\" tone, better suited to gritty, blues music (it's intended purpose).\nManjis feel \"looser\" to play -to me- while Promasters have a stiffer feel... not in a negative way, but I think of it as a controlled, \"formal\" sound/feel.\n\nSince so many are familiar with Manjis, thought I'd use the comparison to help with this Promaster review.\n\nThe Promaster comes in a protective light grey hard shell, molded case with darker grey plush lining. It's curved shape is pleasing aesthetically and makes carrying this harp in one's bag or pocket very easy.\n\nOverall, I'm very pleased with this harp... As I am with all Suzuki harmonicas. Can't go wrong with the fine, Japanese precision engineering and attention to detail.\nEasy accessibility for cleaning & repairs, and replaceable reed-plates are a major plus.

So the portability is very nice and it's easy to handle in all aspects of the process. It has 7 ports on the chain so I have 6 pedals and a tuner, the board fits everything nicely. I did build my pedals around this board so do keep that in mind.\n\nOverall I really do like it for what it is and my current stage of gear it fits my needs perfectly, but there are things where I'm still left wanting, mainly the size, and I realize that this board isn't the end all be all board, but it's great for what it is.

If my child was a serious string player who practiced and played for the love of the instrument then I could see spending the money for the 3/4, however my child doesn't practice consistently and this isn't a full sized instrument.\n\nThe sound isn't as good as my child's 1/2, more muffled than clear, no ringing end notes.  We replaced the strings with pro-arte brand strings and noticed enhancement in the sound.  Good, not great sound enhancement.  The E string broke while the adult \"helper\" was tuning in chamber orchestra, the pegs are stiff and tricky like most new string instruments.\n\nTip, don't purchase the more expensive perlon core style (dominant) strings with this beast.\n\n I then purchased the prelude strings in the red package, now we are talking.  I had forgotten my own lesson with the first cello after we had first purchased it, get the heavy duty strings that last for students (and helpers) who are still learning to tune.  The sound is brighter with the new red pack of strings, you can hear the cello, especially since most students get the cheap strings that are \"brighter\" sounding for their violins that tend to drown out the few cellos.\n\nThe bridge is very thick and appears to be carved from a 2x4, however it gets the job done with little finesse.\n\nPrice is the selling point for this cello.  The price is right and it is able play after easy set up.

Prior to discovering this brand, I begrudgingly purchased Monster cables under the false assumption that they were better than anything else on the market.  Once I learned that one of my favorite guitarists uses these cables religiously, I decided to give Mogami a chance.\n\nIn short, doing so was the best decision I have made in building my collection of high-quality cables.  Performance-wise, these put Monster cables to shame with flawless sound reproduction and virtually silent handling.  With respect to reliability, these once again far outshine anything Monster or their competitors have to offer.  While I admittedly liked the fully gold-plated design of the Monster cables, I found the interface between the solid metal connector and the cable to be a weak point in the construction, and as such, needed to replace a single cable twice within the span of three years.  With Mogami cables, I have not once experienced an issue with build quality in the nearly 2 years I have owned this product.  The contacts are VERY heavy-duty and will hold up for years regardless of whether you're a bedroom studio audiophile like myself or a touring musician.\n\nPROS:\n1. Heavy duty construction with no obvious weak joints to fail unexpectedly\n2. Crystal-clear sound transmission with minimal interference or handling-noise\n3. Great durability, reliability, and quality\n\nCons:\n1. These cables have a somewhat intimidating price-point; however, this is certainly a case of \"you get what you pay for.\"\n2. If you currently use transistor/solid-state equipment, you might not experience the full benefit of upgrading your cables beyond the \"midrange\" options available from other companies.  These cables truly shine when playing through valve state equipment or high quality studio gear.\n\nOverall:\nA must buy for any musican who is serious about every facet of their rig and is willing to shell out a bit of cash for truly outstanding gear.  Not advised, however, for those playing through entry-level equipment.  I hope all of you enjoy these cables as much as I do.", "summary": "Blows Monster out of the Water!", "unixReviewTime": 1516320000}

Ch1 gives me the whole range of low gain, sweetly overdriven jeff beck sounds to pretty rocking rhythm sounds at full gain. The warmth of the overdrive blew me away, it really responds to picking dynamics of passive pickups. The lead sound of my custom built guitar with john petrucci's liquifire pickups going thry ch1 is sheer heaven, that singing lead sound we all dream of.\nCh2 gives u enough gain to go all the way from dreamy long sustained lead sounds to somewhat aggressive metal rhythm sounds. Even at full gain, the sound is well rounded & musical. it does not become abrasive, it doesnt give u ear fatigue after a concert.\nThe 3 band EQ helps u shape the tone to your guitar quite well. its a very musical sounding EQ with no harsh or artifical cuts/boosts. The ISF is surely a gem of a feature : u can get the sound of a warm dark british amp as well as the modern tight sound of american amps, & even some interesting inbetween sounds. This means u won't get bored of this pedal anytime soon, there's tons of sounds to be explored in conjunction with the EQ. FINALLY, the most important feature for me is the cabinet simulator. It is really impressive & helps me get rid of carrying heavy amps around. I just add a reverb/delay in front of it & i can just vary the ISF to get a tight fender/mesa sound or the warm woody sound of marshalls. I even recorded a couple of songs with this & i must say that the cab simulator sounded even more accurate thru studio monitors. when playing rock rhythms, it even simulates the feeling of a cabinet pushing air with each palm muted chug ! Try adding a compressor before this unit & u can rockout a crowd with the tightest of crunching rhythms.\nFinally, some people criticize the footswitches as being somewhat delicate : this may be somewhat true. the unit has never failed me until now but i do understand that they don't seem to be sturdy to jump around on top of it. but considering all the other incredible sounds from this baby, I don't want to nag about it. I'm pretty sure all kinds of guitarists(other than death metal) would love this unit once its explored fully.", "summary": "worth every dollar paid!", "unixReviewTime": 1421020800}

This finish is highly resistant against scratches  . The electrical circuit is good and decent, no hums nor electrostatic noises while adjusting the knobs or switching the pickups. The pickups provide relatively  high output, enough to create some crunchy  clipping in clean channels with some amps. The timbre is suitable for blues , jazz and heavy rock.  Excellent sustain.  After a while i decided to change the pickups for more \"acoustic\" humbuckers that have less kilo ohms, (maybe less inductance) and slightly less output but more bright timbre,  this is just a matter of personal ever changing  tastes. I like the fact that this guitar only has two control knobs, which  makes it  a very simple, no-nonsense elegant and classy guitar ,  this is one of the reasons i decided for this Artcore model instead the most expensive ones\n\nI had to invest some time in adjusting the string action, the nut and leveling the frets in order to get a easier to  play guitar and near perfect  intonation. But this is something you must do with 85% of the guitars on sale regardless of their price tag. Besides this, my only complain would be the tuners weren't smooth, which caused some problems and annoyances , but instead of buying new tuners,  all i had to do was to apply some wd-40 inside the tuners  to make them ultra smooth and precise like any other high quality tuners, so i just don't feel the need to buy new tuners at all, i simply don't. The tuning stability also improved with this .

You could get a really nice powered speaker for 1/4 the cost of this.  This is marketing hype.  If you think it's great, then you have never used a modern high quality powered speaker like a QSC, Meyer, JBL, etc\n\nFirst of all, this claims to be a line array.  A line array is designed to throw the sound farther, but they don't tell you that a line arrays ability to throw sound farther is limited by its length.  The bose is 87 which means its a line array to about 320Hz.  But what does that mean?\n\nIf you have the system dialed to sound good at one spot as you move closer, the bottom four octaves (20Hz to 320Hz) get louder.  However, as you move farther away those frequencies disappear.  The reason is that the line array phenomena is that it cuts the amount a sound decays in half as you move away.  However any sound lower in pitch than the frequency (2X the frequency whose wavelength is the length of the array) in this case 320Hz doesnt get that benefit.\n\nOh wait,  They say its easy to move  A 45lbs bass module, plus the 24 lbs power stand, plus the bottom half of the array at 18lbs and the top half of the array at 16 lbs totals to 103 lbs!  By comparison a traditional speaker stand (Ultimate Stand TS-90B $90) weighs 8lbs, and a QSC K8,10,and 12 1000W powered speaker weigh 27,32,or 41lbs.  Thats half as much!\n\nSo they are supposed to be really loud  According to their comparison system the L1 M2 with a B2 module produces 115dB continuous, and 121dB peak.  The same QSC K8,10&12s peak at 127,129,or 131Hz.  Remember folks every time you add 3dB is twice as much power, so the K8 is 4X as powerful and the K12 is over 8 times as powerful.\n\nThen there is the cost  This system costs $3,198.00  For that you could buy a pair of K12s, Ultimate Stands, and a 8 Channel Touchmix mixer for  $2,680.00 and have a real PA for less money that weighs less.  JBL, and may others have similar systems.\n\nI wrote this review because I am a musician who has a sound company.  I am forever tired of going to venues where they have this junk, and expect us to sound good.  I don't work for or receive anything from QSC, JBL, or anyone else here.  I just know what the professional companies use, and abuse day in and day out.

After selling my previous guitar (a yamaha pacifica), I went to a music store and tried about 10 different guitars.  My criteria was that I wanted at least 22 frets, I wanted humbucker pickups that had coil tapping so I could get both that \"strat\" sound and the full Les Paul sound, a whammy/trem bar, and a really playable neck with no buzzing or octave intonation problems.  I tried LTD's, Ibanez, Fenders, PRS, BC Rich.  Initially, I liked the Paul Reed Smith SE custom ($719), but then I tried the Schecter Hellraiser.  The neck on this guitar was perfect.  Thin, easy to hold and play.  And 24 frets!  However, the Hellraiser was around $800 and I had wanted to keep the price around $500.  So I ordered the Schecter Omen 6 Extreme FR.  It plays great, the neck feels just like the Hellraiser, it has Schecter humbucker pickups with coil tapping, and that amazing Floyd Rose locking whammy bar.  I love this guitar.  While I usually play rock and roll, I spent a couple of hours today just playing clean chords with no distortion.  The sound is amazing on this guitar.  Very rich, deep tone.  And if you pull up on the tone control, the humbuckers go to single coil pickups and sound much like a strat.  I am so impressed by the playability of this guitar.  I have used the whammy bar over and over again, and the guitar just refuses to go out of tune.  Compared to a regular bridge system, where if you bend notes too hard you have to retune, this stays in tune seemingly no matter how crazy you get with your bends-because the strings are locked at the bridge and locked down at the nut at the head of the guitar.  Of course, if you crank up the gain on your amp, this thing will crunch with the best of them, and sustain even at fairly low volumes.  The finish on the guitar is impeccable, and stunning.  Even the tech who replaced my strings for me (I wanted lower gauge strings) complimented the finish on the body of the guitar.  I have not found a single problem or complaint with this guitar. It plays better than guitars costing twice as much. Highly recommended, especially for the price.", "summary": "Best electric in this price range", "unixReviewTime": 1406937600}

However, the Amplug2 Bass unit left me a bit disappointed due to some noise issues, and the lack of tonal variety compared to its guitar counterparts.\n\nThe underlying tone offered by the Amplug Bass is actually quite good.  It had a power low end response with my Squier P-Bass and sounded very full and robust through my Sennheiser HD280 headphones.  Whereas the guitar models have different drive and effects settings, the bass model offers a selection of rhythm patterns to play along with, plus 3 \"gain\" settings for \"high, normal, and low\" gain.  The front of the packaging promotes the device as offering \"boost and compression\" to aid the tone.\n\nThe rhythm patterns were decent enough, and I believe there is an AUX IN jack for jamming along to MP3 tracks.  There is a tempo adjustment too, which is a nice touch.\n\nI struggled with this device in two key ways.  First, there was an almost unavoidable \"hiss\" on my unit, almost no matter what the setting.  Other users noticed that this gets worse if the tone or volume are turned up, but for me it was annoying at all times, and above and beyond what I had heard from the other Amplugs I own.  Is it possible that I have a bad device and other Amplug Bass models would be less noisy?  Sure.  But I do not have the ability as a reviewer to go buy 10 of them to compare and contrast - I have to evaluate the product as it was sold to me, unless it's just clearly broken/defective.  I assume all models have this issue to some degree, and it's unfortunate.\n\nSecond, the different \"gain\" settings were not what I expected.  These are more like difference in volume than in the level of sustain, dirt, or saturation.  I'm not sure I expected a full-on overdriven or \"fuzz\" sound offered by the Amplug, but why not?  Other Amplug models go from clean to dirty with chorus and delay effects.  I'm not very experienced with bass guitar, but the Amplug Bass seemed to offer one type of bass sound that you could make louder or quieter, and change the tone filter a little.  I expected a little more variety.\n\nBy contrast, Zoom makes a product (the B1on) for $50 that offers several different amp models, plus a suite of effects, a 30-second looper, and  more sophisticated drum patterns, and it can also be run on batteries.  The Amplug Bass is compact and powerful, but is too limited and has too many flaws to compare favorably with some of the other alternatives on the market now.", "summary": "Decent clean bass tone marred by excessive noise and limited tonal options", "unixReviewTime": 1454284800}

I think you'd really need a strap pad to make it work for a guitar that weight or heavier, and unless you're a big fan of strap pads (I'm not), you'd likely be better off spending the extra money on a wider strap.\n\nThe ends are very thick, so thick that I can't get my 'strap locks' (beer bottle gaskets.

And innumerable combo Amps, solid state modeling and tube amps both. On the 100 watt Marshall and Soldano I always used the Marshall Power brake (input attenuator) so I could glow the tubes and not have the neighbors call the police. The DSL has a Pentode/Triode Switch on the back that in a way acts as a power brake, sorta. But it allows you to cut the amp back from 100 watt to 50 watt. So you can crank it up and still get that distinctive Marshall sound. I've had the amp almost a year now and I have really enjoyed it. The clean channel is pretty clean and crisp, with both Strats and Les Paul's, and The Dirty channel is pure Rock legend. This is a great amp. And I paid more than the $899.00 Amazon has it offered for. So if you've wanted a Marshall but couldn't afford one. Now is the time. This is a good deal.\nAlso check out the 1960 Cabinet to go with it. Amazon has it at $899.00 as well. Both are great buys.\n\nUpdate: July 2016. the older these get, the sweeter they sound, just like the pickups on a vintage guitar. I have two of these now. Both are still rock solid. And sound phenomenal. And playing through the 1960 cabs, with the 4 Celestion speakers, even turned back to 50 watts, these are killer heads.

The lower register sounds more dynamically even in comparison with the higher register, making this a very well balanced playing whistle.  Overall the sound is almost like a hybrid of a traditional whistle and a recorder, and gladly it doesn't sound exactly like a recorder.\n\nThe look is not traditional of course, but it is very nice.  Theses are lighter than a metal based whistle and feel good in my hands. The holes had a bit of plastic filaments left over from the factory, but this really didn't impact the sound and feel once I scraped them out of there.  It's obviously a cheap construction but it doesn't matter as the sound is absolutely not cheap to the ear.  The tuning capability is a really nice extra feature, and its nice to be able to take off the top piece for easier storage in a pocket.\n\nOverall these are fantastic.  Beginners should absolutely go for these over any others. Advanced players can certainly use these in their collection, especially as their plastic construction makes them ideally suited for playing outside on a cold St. Patricks Day.  Also the case it comes with is fantastic.  It's a simple synthetic leatherish case with a zipper and three pockets in the inside for whistles.

If you need some dynamic Marshall crunch in a floorboard friendly package to add some zazzle to your amp, here you go.\n\nA little more than you need to know maybe: For the last several years my primary amp has been a Marshall Haze 40 tube amp. The Haze has a nice clean channel (if a bit overly bright) but a really muddy OD channel and a significant volume drop when switching from clean to OD and volume spike when switching from OD to clean. Playing with the knobs, etc., I can overcome some of those issues and switch channels without completely changing volume and tone to a distracting degree, but it takes some serious work. So I borrowed the Dirty Little Secret to see if it could help me with that problem. My thinking is that throwing a Marshall in a box in front of the clean channel would allow me to keep the basic volume and tone of the clean channel and then hit the box and get the same good crunch I would out of the OD channel. And the Dirty Little Secret almost completely delivered that promise. The crunch is 95% as good as the natural OD channel when I have it dialed in right on the amp. But there was a certain solid-state sterility that crept in when I'd hit it. That's the reason for just one star shy of 5.\n\nThis pedal is built like a tank and the sound is 95% there. I doubt it would warm up a solid-state amp and it added a little sterility to my tube amp. The difference is close to the \"only dogs will hear it\" territory. But it's there. And I think it's almost worth noting because the Dirty Little Secret has a lot of competition that gets you 80% there for half the cost or less. Is 95% vs 80% worth that price difference to you?\n\nPS. Total side note: I've become nearly allergic to music gear marketing departments' obsession with the dang volume knob on your guitar. I swear everything from dirt boxes to tuners to killswitches \"clean right up with your volume knob.\" There are reasons to want dynamics in your playing, yes. But if music marketing departments are to be believed, everyone's just running around fiddling with their volume knobs constantly.", "summary": "Does What It Says But Not Actually A Tube Amp", "unixReviewTime": 1429833600}

Did extensive research and found this stylish and many good reviews.  Now after about 5 months of practice, I feel this Capo is good to some extent as it is impressive and eye catching. But But......\n\nI didn't like it that much as it is pretty inefficient if used on the first fret.  String A & B buzzes a lot.  I have to re-adjust capo close to metal fret, then far away, mid way and somehow I do get a position where strings dont' buz, but when I start playing guitar, they somehow start to buzz again. Real disappointment there.\n\nAlso, when I press this capo on the string with my hands and strum then there is no buzzing at all.  The moment I let go and strum, then strings start to buzz again.\n\nConclusion: this is a very nice goodlooking, eye catching, impressive-stylish Capo, but it doesn't have that \"required\" press on the string if used on the first fret.  It seems okay to be working on second fret and other ones BUT NOT on FIRST FRET.  Why its a disappointment as I really needed it for the first fret play as my favorite song is played with Capo on first fret.\nIt is good but not good.  Why waste so much of money when it is not doing it's job on the first fret?", "summary": "Did extensive research and found this stylish and many good reviews.

It cost about 6 months worth of rental fees and since we own it the \"pride of ownership\" motivates my son to take good care of it.\n\nOverall, it is a beginning student trumpet so don't expect it to last 50 years. The valves have plastic carriers so you know that they'll get brittle over time. Still, if this trumpet makes it into the last 2 years of high school I think it'll have done well by us.\n\nThe finish (Nickel) is nice and easy to keep bright. It has a nice, bright tone until you really wail on the the high notes, at which time you might notice a little buzzing. Since most students can't punch up the notes like an adult I don't think this is a concern. The valves needed a little breaking in but are otherwise quick and accurate enough.\n\nThe accouterments are all decent enough; the case is basically a formed foam block with a nylon carrier. It's nicely lined on the inside and protects the instrument. There's not much room in the outer pockets so you'll have to carry your music books in your backpacks, kids.\n\nIf you've got a kid just getting started (or maybe you want to pick up the trumpet) then this is not a bad way to go.

I must confess I was kind of hesitant to buy a bass online sight unseen.  But I had an Amazon gift card so I figured I'd take a chance.  I didn't expect Fender USA quality at at this price range, but wow, you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference with this bass!  I've been playing for many years, and I have expensive American made instruments that sadly do not have as good a \"fit & finish\" as this inexpensive Squire bass.  Maybe I got lucky and got a rare \"good one\"  but I was blown away at how well this bass was put together.  Some observations:\n\n1. No dings or finish flaws.\n\n2. Neck is straight with a nice amount of relief out of the box  (.012\" as per Fender specs)\n\n3. Frets are polished smooth and level with no sharp fret ends!\n\n4. String action/height out of box was a tad high (About 1/32nd above Fender's \"recommend\" specs)\n\n5. No fret buzz whatsoever, even after lowering action.\n\n6. Tuning keys seem to be of pretty good quality.\n\n7. Sounds great and plays like butter!\n\n If I had to nitpick, my one complaint would be the volume and tone pots.  They  work just fine but \"feel\" a bit on the chintzy side.  But at this price, I am not complaining.  Ultimately, this bass is an awesome value that (to me) feels and plays just as well as an Fender Am Std.", "summary": "Exceeded expectations", "unixReviewTime": 1492732800}

Finally I decided that I didn't want to pay $100 plus for something that wasn't guaranteed to do what it's supposed to do, and I started looking at the non-name brands.

Recording was flawless, and Native Instruments plugins were zero latency. Ran about 16 tracks audio and, say 8 tracks MIDI. SE3 worked well. Got a budget laptop HP G series with a 2.3 dual core cpu. No firewire ports (whats up with diminishing firewire support?!! Bring it back to the Laptop please!!). So I thought I'd get an Audiogram 6. Seemed cool. USB 1.1 (2.0's are a bit  scant in supply). Came with Cubase AI 5. Cool! I'm a fan of Cubase. I did not like Cubase 5 because there were no MIDI effects, VSTs were cumbersome to assign as it uses a different VST folder/version (better? Really? No). Yes you can assign a vst common folder, but you don't get full functionality with the VST plugin (like I hated with DirectX). Enough about Cubase for now. So, you get this budget laptop, with a budget mic, in a home (budget) studio, with a set of budget speakers/headphones (not budget for me. I'm picky about speakers and headphones.) My whole cabling is TRS or Mic (XLR). Am I going to expect awesome Professional Studio quality from a largely budget system? No. That said. I found this usb interface to be a lot of fun. I am very skilled at tweaking ASIO and achieving low latency while stripping out the issues that lead to clicks and pops. Ran VST Instruments with recorded audio and MIDI, and it worked well. My dual monitors flicker now and then (due to the audiogram). Set the priority to normal, and the latency to normal. When set to high, you get some pops and the latency improves by a whole 4ms (that's nothing! No improvement) If you run windows 7 64 bit (or any os for that matter) please install and use the Yamaha ASIO driver. I have toyed with trying ASIO4ALL driver, but my system is so far so good. I was blown away at the clarity recording from the mic! The on board compressor is very handy! Recorded voice with pauses to see if I could hear noise. Nope. Purely quiet. Don't be fooled by the small hissing in headphones when recording. That hiss is only routed to the headphones and does not appear on the recorded track, so crank it up and sing at whatever level (no need to back away from the mic at times). In sum, firewire is miles ahead of this usb 1.1 24 vs 16 bit for example, and a couple other things. I miss firewire, and plan to return to the FWsolo when I build my next desktop recording computer. For now, the Audiogram is a worthwhile replacement. It is simply irritating to have to fiddle with it to adjust to varying recording situations. Love the sound. AI 5? I went back to SE3. Much better (old, I know. Saving for Artist 6, but not sure if Audiogram 6 can handle Artist 6. Steinberg says it can). Hopefully I'll be back to Firewire by then. Are you a home budget musician recording your own music to enjoy? I would suggest this one. Are you a beginner to the whole ASIO tweaking thing? You may get frustrated. Cubase has been confusing for some ( I understand). I like Cubase (after spending a great deal of time learning how to setup and use it efficiently).

The only thing I really don't like about the violin itself is that the outputs from the pickups seem to be in mono, so when I try to use headphones to practice I only hear the processed signal in one ear, which just feels weird to me and makes me feel \"off balance\". If you use this for recording like I do that's remedied easily enough by recording the channel sound comes through on as a mono track then making it a stereo track with the same content in both channels. It also works well enough through an amp, which is a mono sound source anyway.\n\nThree things that I did to make this a highly satisfactory setup overall was to get a different bow, install a set of Wittner fine-tune pegs, and pick up some rechargeable 9V batteries. I haven't been able to find some kind of headphone adapter that will handle the mono-to-stereo conversion for use while practicing, so if anyone who reads this knows of such a thing, please let me know.

(I bought it for remote recording with my laptop.)\n\nRegarding latency, the built-in audio interface responded to buffer settings in my DAW, with the default setting at 52mS. I was able to reduce the settings to about 20mS, which is still too large for real-time monitoring. However the \"direct monitor\" function on the mic worked fine and my DAW compensated the latency and lined the recording up correctly. On my laptop I had to run Tracktion's \"auto-detect\" function to set the latency compensation correctly. (You can confirm compensation by holding your monitoring headphones up to the mic to record the sound of your DAW's click track. When you zoom in, the recorded click track should fall within a millisecond or two of the beat markers.)\n\nRegarding noise, I recorded myself speaking directly into the mic and compared against my usual recording chain (1\" condenser/preamp/24 bit sound card). After matching levels, the G-track's noise measured only about 6 dB higher. However the character of the noise had a high-frequency emphasis which I think is an artifact of some USB mics. So subjectively I think you can expect about 12 dB worse signal to noise ratio compared with a professional condenser mic. The mic is probably not a good choice for recording quiet sources, but is ok for its intended use of close-miked vocals. You probably won't be bothered by noise recording loud instruments like drum or amped guitars. (Also note that the popular Shure SM57 dynamic mic also has significantly higher noise than the studio setup against which this comparison was made.)\n\nSound character was fine, though as with most condenser mics I like to apply a broad EQ peak around 1-2kHz to flatter vocals. The mic was not too sensitive to plosives -- as long as you hold the mic away at least 8\". I'd recommend a pop filter or wind screen, homemade or otherwise. I didn't try it on guitar or other instruments, but suspect the high-frequency emphasis would work well for most applications. Anyway I'm a firm believer that a mic's character can easily be changed to suit your needs with EQ plugins.

They had always sounded good and the company has a good range of strings to select from.\n\nAbout a year ago I got a mid 70's Yairi dreadnought. The guitar had been played hard all these years and the top was open and it sounded warm and powerful. I realized that there would likely be a search involved to find just the right strings to make the most of this well worn beauty.\n\nThere were string gauge recommendations/limitations inthe soundhole of the guitar. Given the age of the top I wasn't going to exceed the limits. My normal dreadnought strings are Daddario EJ17's (13's, Mediums), but they were outside the limits. I tried EJ16's, the lights, but I felt the warmth was not what I had hoped. Older guitars often have this magic where you get fantastic projection without brittleness or strident tone. The EJ16's didn't bring out enough of the vintage character I felt the Yairi could provide.\n\nSo I began searching other manufacturers to see what was available. These strings were a very close match to the gauge limits so I ordered a pair. Just what I had hoped! Warmth coupled with projection. These strings were a perfect fit for my vintage Yairi.\n\nI'll also mention that the B and high E strings feel unusually thin for their gauge...thinner than EJ16's. It's not bad, just a observation. They are every comfortable to play. You can really feel them under your fingers and they fret easily.\n\nThe downside to these strings are that their tone tends to fade more quickly than my others, hence a 1 star deduction. The sound is so good and they are reasonably priced...despite this flaw I'm sticking with the 2003's.\n\nI've been using these strings for a year and I've never had a broken string. All the sets I've used in that time...about 10...have been uniformly excellent.\n\nIf, like me, you're on a search for a warm, smooth sound that still has projection and power (and you have the guitar top to facilitate this), give these a try. They are perfect for my old Yairi and I've had a positive introduction to Ernie Ball!", "summary": "Fantastic for my vintage dread...warm, full sound", "unixReviewTime": 1357430400}

There was literally nothing left to trim when I was done stringing the D string.

Well a pedal board isn't generally something that is torn down after every gig but the should last as long as you aren't constantly pulling on the cable.\n\nOther thoughts:  I hope that Planet Waves releases some straight jacks as some of my pedals would be better off with those over L-shaped jacks.\n\nSummary:\nI can't recommend this kit enough if you are interested in looking at an easy way to clean up you board with custom cables.", "summary": "Better than pre-made pedal board cables.", "unixReviewTime": 1434326400}

Two plastic side panels are held on with 3 screws each. The sides will probably break if the unit is dropped, but will withstand normal stomping. The flat bottom panel is a flat piece of steel that slides snuggly into grooves on the aluminum chassis. There are two strips of semi-firm rubber on the bottom which are a bit too smooth to prevent the switch for sliding around.\n\nInside the unit, the latching switches are SPDT (single-pole, double-throw) with the common lug and one side lug connected to the jack. The jack is a single TRS plastic panel mount component. One switch is connected to the TIP and the other to the RING. Some devices might expect a TRS plug for their switch inputs. Some will require two TS plugs. In the latter case, you will need a 1/4\" stereo (TRS) to dual mono (TS) \"Y\" cable or the equivalent adapters to use both switches.\n\nAs a side note, the SPDT switches give you the option to wire them to a second SPDT momentary switch and have them work together. I just finished this mod and now have four buttons the top two are the original latching buttons and the lower two are momentary. The top switch reverses the state of the lower. It's useful when you want chose between making a temporary change or latching it on/off. If you want to know more about this mod, ask in the comments.\n\nOverall, I'm satisfied with this product.

I've had it in a D-28 since they released it.  I've used undersaddle pickups for a long time (for ease of use) and never cared for them.  I enjoyed condenser mics better especially recording if available, but there can be short comings at shows.  When the Anthem came out they really pushed the microphone like sound, and I decided to give a shot.  It does sound great, not quite 100% condenser quality, but far better than previous on board mics and undersaddle a I've tried in the past.  I haven't had feedback problems either which is usually a short coming with other pickups.  My only cons for the Anthem are: 1. It does dampen sound, though a small amount, it's enough to be a little frustrating.  2.  Battery pack inside the sound box, baggs and fishman both need to figure out a way to remove the battery from inside the sound box.  Either use a watch battery and make the unit easier to remove and reinstall or have some apparatus the connects to system by strap knob, tying pouch to strap.  Taylor's & Martins Aura systems with a bored out rear pin is the best but I have wondered about removing more wood being a negative aspect to resonance.  I also purchased the floor direct input pedal as baggs used it in all their promo videos, the two pieces together really do sound great and it's great to be able to use a battery in it for one less cord to have.", "summary": "Best pickup for standard D-28", "unixReviewTime": 1410739200}

Once we were plugged in and running, however, it quickly became apparent that sound quality was not compromised, and I got over my tactile apprehensions.\n\nThe receiver can be rack mounted and includes the necessary rack adapters. While we were pumped to fill another void in our rack, we were a little disappointed when we realized that rack screws were not included.\n\nAmazingly, not all wireless mics include a mute button. Thankfully, this one does. This simple addition provides an opportunity to avoid some potentially awkward hot-mic/feedback issues. On the topic of feedback, it is almost non-existent with the Concert 88; unless you're trying, of course. A lack of feedback is great, but good mic technique is also not necessarily rewarded. The mic appears to have been designed more for speaking engagements than singing. Having to sing almost directly into the mic for true representation does open the door to plosive issues. A foam wind screen is certainly recommended.\n\nUnfortunately, the mic does not come with its own holder, and does not fit into any of the molded plastic holders that fit our other mics. We can use a spring loaded clamp holder, but even that is not a perfect solution. I find myself frequently holding the mic in my back pocket when not in use, which is obviously not ideal.\n\nI do have some longevity concerns but, overall, I am pleased with the performance of the system at this price point.

It is the best Telecaster chickin pickin speaker I have found yet! I mostly play Brad Paisley stuff (Nails it!) with some Slash thrown in. The Fender Mustang I with this speaker is like having Dr. Z Maz 38 amp in your home office under your desk. Cleans are superb all the way up to 10. Chest caving bass, with a slight mid range bump. No flubbiness at all yet still smooth and not stiff. My favorite speaker yet and I have tried nearly all of them from Celestion and most from Eminence. Just know that this is a super LOUD speaker even with a 20 watt modeling amp with volume at 5 will chase you out of your house. Mustang 1 is Definitely gig-able with this speaker for a small hall or church. I ordered a Celestion Gold 10 for a benchmark comparison and will update my review after I get a chance to get the Gold broken in good. Make sure you break in the Ramrod on 8 with heavy bass for about 50 hours before you give it the real sound test. It warms up and bass fills in a lot after about 50 hours of beating.

But when turned on it really does shine.  There are multiple delay-type effects (3-types of basic delays, a pan effect, a ping-pong effect, a basic modulator, and reverse delay) and I've found each one to be quite effective and nice...there's even three types of basic delays (Tape, Digital, Analog), and each sounds unique offering different things.\n\nOTHER FEATURES:\nIn addition to the delays, it also has the ability to lock a setting once you dial it in by flipping the toggle.  Even if you unplug it, it still remembers the setting.  It also has a 40 second looper (it calls it \"hold\") where you can stack parts on.  There's also a tap delay feature: if you have it on any effect model except for \"hold\", just hold down the switch for 2 seconds then tap the delay speed...you can even hold it for 2 seconds more to go back to on/off mode while still keeping that tapped speed.\n\nALL IN ALL:\nI love this pedal.

Long", "reviewText": "I play keys, but my co-writer plays only guitar. I am using Sonar 8.5 and a Roland Juno-G as a remote instrument through a MOTU Ultralite and a return through a M-Audio 4x4 MIDI hub. The lag we experienced while testing was very small, about maybe 3-5 milliseconds.\n\nConsidering the path from the YRG through the MOTU, through the computer, back through the MIDI hub to the instrument, we found it to be entirely acceptable. One method we plan on using to offset the difference in performance is to use an on board sound monitored locally through an amp, while recording silently in the DAW. After recording, maybe three small nudges left and the track should have no problems lining up.\n\nIn hindsight, we didn't even try to go direct MIDI right to the instrument \"in\", cutting out three stops along the way. In that setup we would just record from the MIDI \"through\" of the instrument. I was being lazy and the setup worked fine as is. At first he was a little disappointed in the response on the strings, then we increased the sensitivity in the control panel and that did the trick.\n\nBut what is great was when we threw down a quick scratch track with keys and guitar and within a few minutes the guitar player was laying down an incredibly expressive synth sax line, that would have been impossible for me to duplicate using keys. This is exactly what I got it for and I wasn't disappointed. Even with the slight lag, after just a few minutes he was hitting the next note just slightly early enough to sound great. It's not sporadic, the lag is entirely predictable and consistent. So I agree with the learning curve statement given in an earlier review.\n\nConsidering the cost of any available alternative for MIDI guitar conversion, I personally believe this to be a incredible value. I have only owned it for about two weeks, so I will note any future problems in the comments section. One thing to note is that if using USB power, you might want to look into getting a fairly long USB cord.

After manufacturing this machine for 20+ years you'd think Alesis would be kind enough to supply ALL of the information to make our purchase go smoothly. Nowhere does it state in the description that the footswitch jacks require MOMENTARY switches. These switches are not uncommon but they are not commonly made in a two button configuration to reduce cord clutter. After fumbling around with a Johnson latching switch I realized my mistake.\nA good choice of pedal is the Boss FS6 which is switchable from latching to momentary. Along with a 1/4 TRS and 1/4 TRS to mono splitter I'm finally in business AND a little neater.\nI suspect the SR18 needs the same switch........ Why isn't Alesis offering the machine WITH a usable footswitch?\n\nEDIT for the following comment.\n-------------------------------\nThere is NO 3/4 time preset and contrary to what google searches say, it is not easy to program your own waltz rhythm. The manual is useless and I have not found even one accurate, step by step explanation of how to accomplish it. After several frustrating attempts I ordered the SR18 which does include waltz rhythms but has its own set of problems. (Some day I'll review my experience with it). I returned the sr18 within days.\n\nAlesis has made available a system update file for the sr16 that includes 3/4 time but it requires a USB to midi interface which is another $40 or so. The upgrade works well but be aware the 'in' cable has to go to the SR16's out port and the out cable has to go to the in port.\nConfusing but it works. I used the \"SyEx Librarian.app\" on my Mac to push the upgrade to the Alesis and it rebooted with the updates immediately.", "summary": "Love the Rythyms", "unixReviewTime": 1423008000}

Daddario has the best, most consistant strings in the business. The wound strings are wound with just the right amount of tension as to not feel to stiff to most players.

Furthermore, Daddario uses the right diameter cores and windings to achieve a tensionally-correct string (other brands can have, for instance, a stiff A string compared to either the E and/or D string or strings that feel slinkier at the expence of breakage). Lastly, Daddario's doesn't just pack the strings in an air-tight package. Nope!

Plus these are the strings I prefer anyways. Had high hopes for it but even looking at the picture I thought \"I wonder how they get the strings to not bind up inside?\". The answer? They didn't. First string I went to grab was the low E. I followed the instructions and held the rest of the strings in place while pulling and it got stuck. Pulled as hard as I could without risking damage to the string and it would only come out about 6 inches...and then it wouldn't go back in. I tried another string, same thing. I now had 2 low E strings sticking out 6 inches from the box. I had no choice but to open the box up all the way, take apart the plastic spools inside, unwind ALL of the low E strings, and then try to wrap them back up again. The result? I now have 25 brand new low E strings with finger prints all over them. Thought my problems were over once I finished with the 3 wound strings. Nope. Sure enough went to grab a G and it got stuck. Took some serious coaxing to get it out. I would rather pay the extra money for 25 individual sets of these strings than ever get this bulk box again. They didn't even wrap each bundle of strings in protective sleeves either so by the time I use the last few sets they will probably be corroded and useless. Especially the low E's thanks to my prints. Basically what I'm saying is unless you are a guitar repair tech and plan on changing 25 sets of strings in one week do NOT buy this.

I think the Hards are too hard though for most ukulele's. The Hard's may work for baritones or electric's/solid bodies. The Hard's are about twice as thick as the Medium and Soft. The Medium and Soft are essentially the same thickness; the only difference is the tension in them. I find that the Medium is the best though because of that extra little resistance.

Sure, there are better (and more expensive) interfaces out there, but the Tascam is a very good buy for the money. A reviewer below gave it low marks because the 20 inputs count the ADAT/SPDIF inputs. ALL manufacturers count their inputs that way, Tascam is not out to deceive anyone. I use a UA 4-710D with my Tascam via ADAT and it works great.\n\nI've been playing with my new Celesonic for a couple of months now and like it. To summarize:\n\nPros\n1. The pres seem open and clear.\n2. Lots of volume from the headphones. Two headphone outs, which is perfect for me.\n3. 3 modes of operation-mixer, interface, and preamp. I find this very handy rather than being the impediment that the other reviewer found them to be.\n4. Intuitive software package with a lot of flexibility for routing and other tasks.\n5. Word clock BNC connections. My last interface lacked these. I clock to the 4-710D.\n6. USB3 support with Windows 10.\n7. Latency seems to be fine. I'm running a sample rate of 64 with no issues so far.\n8. A very solid build. Everything works smoothly and feels tight.\n9. XLR inputs up front. For my setup, this is great and saves some wiring and patchbay real estate.\n10. 10 line outs, two are used for monitors. 2 additional line ins out back for my Integra 7.\n11. MIDI DIN in and out.\n12. ADAT support. I use a UA 4-710D as the front end and need an interface with ADAT. SPDIF in and out as well.\n13. Rack and desktop ears included.\n14. iOS support for working with my iPad.\n\nCons (room for improvement)\n1. Phantom power for channels 1-4 and 5-8 rather than per channel.\n2. The gain knobs are very small due to the XLR inputs being in the front. However, this is more than offset for me as stated above.\n3. Wall wart instead of an internal transformer.\n4. Metering-there is one lamp for each channel that changes color as clipping is approached. Not a huge deal, but a band rather than a single lamp would be better.\n\nI feel that cons 1, 2, and 4 are due to the fact that real estate on the front of the interface is limited due to the XLR inputs being up front.\n\nOriginally I thought that there was no clock lock indicator except in the software, but this isn't really the case.

There is a reason why Alex Van Halen and John Bonham played this drum. These guys had the choice to play any drum and they went with this drum. I can't see how you can be disappointed. The only issue might be the P-85 throw-off. Sometimes they stick. I don't why Ludwig refuses to redesign the basic throw-off. They should just install P-86s on all their snares and call it a day. Someone over there must be stuck on \"tradition\" or \"authenticity\" and cost. Can it really be that much more to use the P-86?

I'm a professional photographer and I often run into situations where I want something a little offbeat on a set or in a location shot. LED light sticks like this aren't something I get to use everyday, but they do add a quirky touch to location portraits and band portraits and I've used a number of MARQ products in the past just for this reason. I also work at an FM radio station part time and I'm sure we'll find a use for these at live events--be great to draw people to a booth at trade shows, that's for sure.\n\nThis particular set of lights (like most of the other MARQ products that I have) suffers from one thing: a lack of a really good manual. This set is nice in that they have 30 preset programs (so you don't need a DMX controller necessarily--though you would certainly get more out of them if you owned one and knew how to use it), but it still takes time to get them to repeat certain patterns and to predictably call them up. I sat on my living room floor for several nights entertaining the cats (and I think my neighbors) playing with various configurations and various programmed effects. (Seriously, I have to wonder why none of my neighbors came knocking to see what was going on.) I got elated when I stumbled onto a really cool effect and then somewhat frustrated trying to go back to it again. But hey, I've been a photographer a long, long time and that's how you learn to use all lighting (though I will say that photographic lighting comes with vastly better manuals).\n\nEach of the tubes has 32 LED lights in them and they are one meter (about a yard) long and they lighting is very intense--that's one thing I love about all MARQ products, by the way, in terms of light output and color purity, they rock. The colors are super saturated and the biggest issue I've had in trying to photograph them is finding a good exposure to capture the nicely saturated colors accurately.\n\nI really like the fan stand that they come with, but it's also nice that you can set up each stick on its own. I'm going to experiment soon with doing some time exposures with a model moving the sticks around--perhaps one in each hand. I've read in a few other reviews that they aren't that well protected in the case, but I think if you're careful with them, the case is fine and its a very nice travel case. I eventually cut out a pice of black foam core material from the dollar store to lay on top of the tubes but that's just because I have a tendency to toss tuff into my prop/lighting room quickly at the end of a long day--but again, I think if you treat the contents with respect (it is light gear, after all) you'll be fine.\n\nSo my favorite things about these lights? The colors are bright and saturated and if you play with the programs, you'll find some super cool effects. If you have kids in their teens, forget it, you're going to find these going in their bedrooms all night long. I also like that you can set them up on individual stands (be great in a window display at the holidays--though they're kind of pricey for that) or you can fan them together. I think a DJ that does their own lighten and knows how to run a DMX box will have a blast with these.", "summary": "Nice saturated and bright LED colors and lots of cool effects", "unixReviewTime": 1465948800}

I've only had them a few days, and the only con I can think of, I share with a lot of other buyers. When you switch them off, you get a POP. I don't care what anyone says, it can't be a good thing for the speakers. Solution? Simple, plug them into a dedicated surge protector/power strip and turn off the strip when you want to turn them off.

Surely it must be out there... If you're never going to need battery power, you'll probably want something with some onboard effects, there are many out there, but for power source versatility and excellent dry sound for little gigs this board kills it.

All it does is amplify the signal that comes from your guitar and transform it from analog to digital, then you can choose the output method, through your pc speakers, the headphone (or monitor) jack in the Guitar Link, or the computer headphone jack. The plastic doesn't look \"chinese\", if you know what I mean. It feels resistant and strong enough to take on a few drops.\n\nYou HAVE to have it plugged in during the installation or else it won't work. Also, it only installs on one USB port at a time, so I recommend you choose one port just for it (not that the port is goning to stop working or anything).\n\nThe installation instructions are really like this:\n-Insert the CD with the guitar combos. Install all 3 if you want, although you are good to go with the AC Box Combo alone (other 2 are 30 min trials)\n-Plug the Guitar Link and start the driver setup, it is in a folder called \"drivers\", but I don't remember which of the two CDs has it.\n-Restart your computer and start the AC Box Combo.\n-You are all set to start playing.\n-If you want all the other software you might as well continue installing it.\n\nThe software included is mostly trash. It comes with 3 Combos, one full version, the other 2 are 30 minute trials. You can use this if you are an amateur and you will be more than happy. The Audacity has a learning curve as steep as a skycraper, and the \"lite\" version of Energy (called EnergyX2 or something like that) is a liiiittle limited. If you plan to make a studio of your office or room I recommend you buy something more \"professional\", I personally use Fruity Loops and Waves GTR, but a friend has a couple IK that work awesome and most come with a pedal.\n\nThe 64bit asio4all driver is included but is named like setup36.exe, who knows why not 64 or 86, so don't worry, it supports vista/7, 32/64 bit. I haven't tried it on MacOSX or XP.\n\nBottomline: Definitely is a good investment, weather you are a pro or a beginner. Good quality and good design.

The easy access battery compartment is great too, right next to the 1/4\" jack.  I like the brightness of the Martin sound, but I have grown to like this bassier tone equally.  It counters my brighter sounding DX1 and I highly recommend it.  This was $759, but I later saw a Maple topped, all wood Martin acoustic/electric for $829.  It had the cut out for higher fret use to it as well.  If I had it to do all over again I would have given the higher priced one a chance first.  This is my traveling guitar because of all wood and when amped out the bass really comes through.  I used it once at a nursing home right after getting it and it was flawless.

You cannot change the default mode, and this mode has changed over software versions.\n\nAs VST host\nGood luck using non NI VST plugins. most will load, but good luck finding presets, or saving presets.\n\nInadequate routing, poor/frustrating integration with a DAW environment (Maschine as a VST), and a clear focus on sound packs vs functionality means this is not a good purchase.. used prices reflect this.\n\nOn the + side, you do get a lot of kits and content, and Maschine is a decent midi controller so has dual use.\n\nSummary\nIts like hanging out with an 8 year old... its fun for a while, but sooner or later you want adult company.\n\nBUY if\na) You are new to music production, and want ONE entire ITB item.\nb) You have simple needs of groove/rhythm production\nc) If you are seeking a lot of drum content and need inspiration on grooves/rhythms.\n\nDON'T BUY if\na) You think that Maschine will short circuit the need for a DAW. It wont. You will still need to learn Live, Logic, Sonar etc.\nb) You have any hardware gear .. its painful.\nc) You have a DAW and think that using Maschine standalone will be quicker and easier.

I could say that, but I won't because with the built in Wizards, you could get away with knowing very little about these things, and still get great results. I would strongly recommend, however, adding the RTA-M reference mike to your purchase, unless you have something else equivalent.\n\nThere are several Wizard programs, that will take you through setting up the DriveRack to recognize your system, set volume levels, auto EQ etc... Even pros should appreciate these apps as they pave the way to a great starting point in ringing out your system, and your venue. While Pink and White noise generation is available, the Wizards use frequency sweeps to tune the system, speaker by speaker, and point by point in the room.\n\nThe feedback control is quite nice. With 12 filters that can be divided in to Fixed (for room characteristics) and Active ( to handle performance characteristics) this system keeps feedback on a very short leash.\n\nGetting the best out of your sound system is achievable as the Driverack has 6 XLR outs for stereo High, Mid, and Low speaker systems OR you can run a single chain for a simple mono system. The RTA Wizard takes your configuration and figures out where you should place the reference mike for it to analyze your system.\n\nThe Automatic Feedback System (AFS) is used after you have set up a rough mix with all mikes in place. This clever little wizard listens to the system as you raise your mixer faders. You can hear the feedback begin, and then get squelched as the AFS kicks in. The fixed filters are set automatically, but you can change the Fixed/Auto filters allocation if you like/need to.\n\nPros will appreciate the ability to control pretty much anything from the Display contrast, to the Crossover frequencies on each speaker array.\n\nThe only thing i can think of to complain about is the size of the display, but even I think this is unfair because, let's face it, it is a 1U sized device. There is not a lot of real estate to work with. There is also a Laptop application that will allow access to the device via a router, with makes the controls much easier to manipulate.\n\nWhichever way you choose to control this device, you do not need to drill down through more than a couple of menu layers, due to the array of buttons that will bring you to each section's \"Home\" screen.\n\nIn summary, you get a lot of bang for the buck.

Swanson", "reviewText": "I love small amps and have played many of them over the last 25 years. I still own a few, my favorite being the first Super Champ from the early '80s; Rivera nailed that one. I naturally prefer tubes for that true tone, but tried one of these out last year at a pal's place and was sold within two minutes. I bought one six months ago and after playing it almost daily since then I can say without doubt that this is the most versatile solid state practice amp I've ever used.\n\nFor the money it's a crazy deal. I have never once used the included online stuff or the Ableton software, so those add even more value to this package, no doubt. All I wanted was a warm up amp with real tone, and this is that and plenty more. My all-time favorite tone is the clean glassy Fender late-'50s/early '60s sound, typified by the Bassmans and Twins and Deluxes of the pre-CBS era. That tone needs tubes to really sing, but to my amazement the amp modeling of this Mustang comes amazingly close to that sound without tubes. You'll always miss that tube sag but the crispness and snap is all there, especially on the Bassman settings. My Strats sound so damn good through this on clean settings, and my PRS absolutely smokes with real lease-breaking volume on Super-Sonic (dial the gain way back for a nice low-throttle roar).\n\nHaving gain, volume and master lets you dial in a TON of tones with each amp model, and the two separate effects knobs let you add chorus/tremolo etc plus various reverbs/delays etc, though I find myself keeping everything totally clean as time goes by; if I can't get the tone I want with my fingers then I need to learn how to is my motto. And this amp is so accurate that I can.\n\nAbove all, this Mustang is MUSICAL. For a small amp that's a real feat, but for 100 clams it's a near miracle. Add a built in tuner (the most useful \"extra\" ANY amp can have), good effects, great amp models, the software and more online amp models (which I'll get around to one day but so far I get all the tone I need from the amp as it is), plus 20 watts for lots of headroom, and this is a straight up steal for a bill.\n\nThe only thing missing is serious bass at volume, but this is an 8 after all, not a 10, so you'll always miss some of the real bottom. But what's there is solid and tight and only craps out at top volume; only with a rock drummer will you need more roar than this provides. You could easily do quiet jazz and folk gigs with this puppy.\n\nAll told, the Mustang I is easily not only the best value practice amp of them all out there now (Crate and Line 6 etc don't come close), but paired with a mini-Strat this would be the absolutely PERFECT beginner's set up for a kid looking to play anything from the Beatles to Metallica and everything in between.\n\nCan't recommend this highly enough to anyone who thinks real tone can't come in a small solid state amp. It can, it does, and it's cheaper than I can still believe.\n\nFender truly went to 11 on this one.\nLeo would be proud!", "summary": "Best cheap amp of them all", "unixReviewTime": 1354233600}

It is common for instruments that are made of natural materials like wood to be inconsistent and have some flaws. Things like temperature and humidity levels cause wood to change shape a little bit and can even cause wood to warp or crack. Add to that the fact that the wood is under the tension of tightly wound steel wires (strings) and you have a reasonable probability of inconsistency.\n\nI have to say that I find the Epiphone Hummingbird PRO to be a possible exception to the hard and fast rule of: Try Before You Buy. When I received my Hummingbird PRO, I saw it has several markings on it indicating that it had been inspected multiple times prior to shipping. It has markings indicating that while it had been manufactured in Indonesia (the way Gibson/Epiphone keeps the cost down...and a good part of the world to find quality woods, I might add) it was \"100% Inspected and set up in the USA\" by Epiphone. If you don't know what a \"set up\" is, that refers to the guitar being adjusted to make it playable. The neck is straightened and all warps and twists are removed, the sting height is adjusted to be low enough to make the instrument easily playable but not so low as to cause the strings to 'buzz' against the frets, etc. When I received my Hummingbird, it was nearly in tune! Only 2 strings were out of tune and those 2 were not even a 1/2 step out of tune! It seems Epiphone tries to make this guitar set up and ready to play right out of the box and they got pretty close to that goal.\n\nThe action is low and comfortable, the fit and finish of the guitar is VERY smooth, and it's polished to a glossy shine. Epiphone makes this guitar ready for playing right out of the box without the need for an expensive set up at your local guitar shop/luthier. All the surfaces of the guitar (pearloid in-lays, frets, all the wood, etc. were smooth and polished. Mine is the Faded Cherry Burst, of course (at the time of this writing, I believe that is the only finish being offered on the PRO version of this guitar). This guitar just looks gorgeous!\n\nI may want to change the strings one day but that would only be because I want a different tone from the guitar. The strings that come stock on the guitar are good, loud, clear sounding strings. The stock strings are plenty good enough to leave on there for awhile. I don't know what brand the stock strings are but I assume they are Gibson/Epiphone brand or some brand that is owned/partnered with them.\nUPDATE: I read today (3/12/13) on the Epiphone site that these guitars are strung with Gibson Masterbuilt .012 to .053\n\nI knew I was taking a bit of a gamble buying an acoustic guitar online and it's normally not something that I would do or recommend; however, the Hummingbird PRO is so new that I couldn't find it locally yet (which is pretty incredible considering I'm in Houston, TX of all places). I took the gamble because it's not some knock-off, no-name brand. It's an Epiphone. Epiphone goes to great lengths to offer a high quality performance worthy instrument. In this case, the risk paid off and I'm completely happy with my guitar.\n\nHint: If you think the batteries in the pre-amp may have arrived dead, remember to turn up the Volume dial on the pre-amp when you test it. Replacing the batteries in this guitar only costs about $8 (at the time of this writing) and it doesn't hurt to have a spare set in your case either.\n\nThe earlier reviews were right on! I highly recommend this guitar!\n\nUPDATE: Incidentally, this guitar did not ship with a case or gig bag.

I am more of a casual guitarist and not so much the type to see others and laugh at their doo doo playing or someones attempt at it.  I don't really claim to be great nor do I play in a band.  I usually just play songs with my kids and throw a good metal sound in the middle of it.  Being thirty years old is kind of late to start learning guitar but you can really learn to play anytime.  Its just if I were younger there would be so much free time to get good.  So don't take this review as definitive or critical but merely my experience as a somewhat newer player (little less than a year or so).  I know judging from what some people might think since I'm new I should have it setup by one of those musician magician stores.  I really am not that serious to that point to take it somewhere and have to pay for fixing it.  I enjoy playing by myself and thats really all I can see myself doing.  But enough about me and my awesomeness and onto my experience.  But first I must say this is all my personal experience and I really went by other reviews to decide.  At the time I bought this one it had just come out and there were no professional reviews.  Take this review as coming from a commoner slack jawed yokel perspective and you'll appreciate my whatever I guess.  But its like my dad told me \"if someone doesn't like your guitar playing take them outside and stone em.\"\n\nI am very reluctant about ordering a guitar and having it shipped but I got this one through the Musicians Friend website and not from Amazon.  I didn't know much about John5 at the time when I bought it but now I really appreciate his work when I hear it.  A lot of the reviews I have read on this guitar have been generally good out of the box.  Not so much for me.  First off we will go with whats so toilet about it.  I have fret buzz on a lot of the frets and at first not so much at first but after a day or so it came.  I don't know if its my climate maybe my neck bent around or what but now no matter how I move the truss rod it always has the same results.  The truss rod does its intended job though so let me make that point.  Something else I noticed was I was getting a lot of feedback in my amp from the guitar until I rested my hand on the chrome parts of it be it the the frame or the amp connection point.  The buzz would stop whenever I touched the metal parts.  The next issue would be the amp plug in spot (can't recall what its called) constantly has to be tightened or it will come loose.  The next problem I found was the nut got kind of loose or something since it almost seemed like it wasn't cut the right depth for the strings which may of caused the fret buzzing.  I am not qualified to diagnose the condition so I won't even try.  The last thing is this thing loves your finger prints.  It shined like a diamond out of the box but really collected finger prints fast.\n\nNow I know I have read around about the hatred of the Squier brand but some were still good.  When I first took the guitar out my wife told me it looked like a country music guitar just from the looks.  The width is what really gets to me since it is a little heavier but nothing major I found my self always hitting one string off at first when not looking and just picking it up.  My other guitar is really thin and feels like I am holding air sometimes I would look down only not to be playing anything merely air since it was so light. Anyways the good things are that it stays in tune very well and the strings that came with it are kind of nice but I would recommend switching them out but the factory ones are still good.  Steel I think and have kind of a cold sound\nto them but still offer what I want it to sound like.  I also thought two volume knobs was weird but now after messing around with them I had a great sound but there is always a twang to anything I play and I have no clue if that's normal but it still sounds good so I guess its a good thing.  Flicking the switch to get a different sound is another unique feature I really like on this guitar.  I still find myself messing around with the switch to see what sounds I can pull off.  From country to metal to air guitar I think most people will find something to enjoy about this guitar.\n\nNow this is not a heavy sounding guitar with these pickups but it does offer plenty of tone.  Of course to get a devilishly fiendish devil sound out of it you will need extra devil equipment.  I knew this guy who claimed he conjured the devil with his guitar playing greatness.  He said he couldn't show me or it would compromise his deal and code of silence with the devil.  I took him at his word though it didn't make since because he played bluegrass.  Don't get me wrong it sounds great its just to get that sound I was looking for I had to take extra effort.  Oh yeah he also said he grated cheese over his strings.\n\nMy final thoughts are for the price you may be able to find yourself a better guitar or maybe you will love this one but its up to your ears and maybe even your patience or expectations.  I have seen around other Squier reviews for cheaper models than this one and there are some that are really good.  Its really tough to give a solid recommendation for something costing around four hundred dollars but who knows it may be worth it to you.  In my mind its a sharp looking guitar with a sharp sound.

The first is the HellBabe01 wah wah pedal. Very good...especially for the price. So, that convinced me to try out the GM108 amp.\n\nI received it yesterday and I have to admit...I really like it. Has very good sound although you have to set it just right. The distortion is not the best, and it can overwhelm you. The amp modeling is not bad, although there seems to be very little difference between the U.K. and U.S. settings. I've read where people complain the clean setting is too quiet. Hmmm...mine seems to be fine. It's not super loud, but not soft, either.\n\nIt seems to handle my HellBabe and Digitech RP55 mutli-effects pedal pretty well, also.\n\nI haven't tried connecting my iPod to it, yet, but I think that is a cool feature. Also, not sure if I will use the amp modeling very much, since the RP55 has that covered. I plug headphones directly into the RP55 when I need to be quiet, so I don't need that in the amp.\n\nSo, why'd I get it, then? Easy, it beats lugging my 32 year old Hohner 1230 around. The fact that it has a few features and sounds great is just gravy for me.\n\nI definitely recommend this amp.  Oh, yeah..sounds MUCH louder than 15 watts! It's a whole lot of amp for $60! I had my my eye on a Fender Frontman 10G. I think this is a much better deal!\n\nMay 6th 2010 update:\n\nWell, bad news. My amp developed a horrible thud noise and static when playing. Thought it was my less than 2 month old Epiphone SG-310 which I've since returned. Got an Epiphone LP-100, plugged it in and it's doing the exact same thing. Tried a new cord as well.\n\nI'm swapping out the amp for a new one. Should be here in a couple of days. Let's hope it last's more then 30 days this\ntime!\n\n2nd update May 10th:\n\nWell, goodbye amp. Makes the exact same thud, muddy, staticy sound through the headphones and without them!

There is only about half an inch in between where it clamps onto the rod and the bottom on the metal plates. That means any fine-tuning height adjustments are going to have to be made from wherever the rod it is mounted.

It is well-made, well-padded, looks terrific & fits my Epiphone Les Paul like a glove, (and my Les Paul looks terrific in the case as well). I only wish I could have found fitted cases like this for my Stratocasters & Telecaster. This is just a terrific case. When I first opened it I immediately noticed that there was no strong 'new case' odor. (I usually air out a new case for a day or two before putting my guitar in it. There was no need to with this case.) I really appreciate the 'safety latch' on the opposite side from where you open it, this looks like added protection from the case inadvertently flying open. The case also has a locking latch for security, however please note that it only comes with one key - another key would be nice, just in case (no pun intended). A nice touch is the very large, well-cushioned carrying handle which allows you to maintain a comfortable grip. The metal feet on the back & the bottom of the case are also appreciated - You can actually stand the case up on the floor without leaning it on something due to the feet on the bottom (I'd be worried a pet might bump it an knock it over though). As stated, the interior is very well padded, and it features a wonderful covered compartment in which to carry accessories such as picks, a tuner, a strap or an instrument cable etc.\nI really like the fact that because it is made for a specific model guitar, the Epiphone Les Paul case is no bigger than it has to be. You'll be surprised at how compact it is. Not only will this easily fit in the 'way back' of my SUV, but it will also easily fit in my convertible which I can't say for my large ABS cases that I keep my Telecaster & Stratocasters in. Granted the large ABS cases have lots of bins for storage inside, they are also heavy & more difficult to carry around, where this case is much easier to carry & has enough storage for just what you need to take along with your Les Paul Guitar.\nFor the price paid I wasn't expecting such a nice guitar case.

They have a nice smooth feel to them, not as smooth as Elixirs mind you, but smoother than most of the others I've played which have included almost all the coated and non-coated Light variations (12-53/54) of D'addario's and Martin's. They also hold their tune very well. I've had them on my guitar for 3 weeks and have put roughly an hour on them each day and they still feel and sound very similar to the first day I put them on. The other brands are fine, they aren't bad but they aren't great on my guitar, either.\n\nThe magic, folks, lies in the tone these bring to my Taylor 414. With the other Phosphor Bronze strings I've tried the guitar sounds very \"flat\". My guitar is a little too balanced sounding and sometimes doesn't seem to want to jump out and grab your attention. The bass always feels a little reined in and the mids tend to dominate. All the 80/20's I've tried were a little too \"crispy\" sounding and the uncoated ones didn't last very long. I admire the Ernie Ball engineering team for keeping some of that \"crispy\" tone from 80/20's while adding longevity to the string by blending some Aluminum into the mix. A very clever way indeed to make the strings last longer while not having to coat them. Even after 3 weeks of daily play for 1 hour, there aren't even any dents on the underside of the strings where they hit the frets or color changes on the played parts of the strings. That definitely speaks volumes about the quality of the strings. Ernie Ball also claims these strings are louder than other strings and they are, that isn't marketing bs. The lows are very powerful, tight, big and very three-dimensional sounding and I can only imagine how these would transform a Martin D28!\n\nFor the price of these strings, they're definitely worth a try in my opinion. I am not endorsed by Ernie Ball either, I'm just an amateur strummer trying to get the best tone I can from my Taylor :)", "summary": "Multi-dimensional tone to your guitar", "unixReviewTime": 1435536000}

This uke is better in terms of sound quality, intonation, and appearance.\n\nI tuned the strings dead center to standard GCEA then did scales to see how accurate the notes were, and they were all within the 'in-tune\" band (G-Strings App) while the Lanakai was about 3 times as far from dead center.  In both cases the notes tended to be on the high (sharp) side.\n\nThe laser etched details are nice as are the dark bands on the front and back.\n\nI dinged this a full star because the sides of the frets aren't as smooth as I would have expected.  Some masking tape and 400 grit sandpaper should smooth this out.  Also, the gig bag, although quite nice given the price point, had some mold growing on it, indicating that it must have been quite humid where this was packed and shipped.  There was even some mold on the Uke when it arrived - a microfiber cloth with some water and Murphy's oil soap cleaned this up, but I would hope this was an exception.\n\nFree/discounted sample received for evaluation.  My goal is an honest and informative review. If you have any questions or comments, please let me know!", "summary": "Excellent intonation and detail, just need some dessicant and a little more finish on the frets....", "unixReviewTime": 1468281600}

Other than the intentional grit of my pedals, I couldn't hear anything from my amp that would make me think I was using a wireless system.

It's battery powered. Can't get around this so just make sure it's fully charged before a gig or recharge after each session.  If you leave it fully plugged into the base without powering up the base you will be transmitting and will discharge the battery.  I just push it into the base but not all the way down.  That way it's where I expect it to be without draining the battery.\n\nThis is just so simple and easy to use.

However, because there is very little output in those lower positions, I don't find it to be an issue.  In fact I rarely feel the need to use the full travel of the treadle when doing volume swells.  I thought it a bit strange that this thing specifies a 12 volt AC adapter yet can be powered by a 9 volt battery.  So... I decided to see if I would have any issues if I used my One-Spot AC adapter on it - polarity corrected, of course.  It worked just fine.  I usually power my looper with the same adapter so I built a splitter cable with labeled, polarity specific terminations and everything worked fine.  My curiosity didn't end there though.  I wanted to know if there would be any discernible difference if I used a 12 volt power supply.  I did it and the only difference I could find was that the power indicator LED was just a wee bit dimmer using the 9 volt adapter.  There was no change in the sonics whatsoever, nor was there a reduction in output volume that I could hear.  So what's up with the 12 volt adapter spec, Behringer?  Did you think you could fool all of us out here?  I give it four stars because even though you don't have to use the pedal's full sweep, it just not very comfortable in those lower positions.  I'll probably get used to it eventually.", "summary": "Au contraire, mes Amis. You CAN use a 9 volt adapter!", "unixReviewTime": 1347148800}

Compared to the unknown brand strings that were on my guitar and the Ernie Ball set that followed, these (IMHO) sounded and played better. The tone was fuller, and the trebles were more pronounced (clearer) and balanced. After using one set of these Pro-Arte, I decided to try a set of Savarez 520R. (If you have any experience at all with classical guitars, you probably know that one should experiment with strings to find the \"right\" strings for one's taste.) Although I have not made a clear decision as to which string sounds better to me, I will say that they are very comparable. Both types of strings offer full, round bass notes and clear treble notes. The Savarez may be a bit rounder / brighter on the bass side, but these Pro-Arte also sound excellent. The trebles may be slightly louder with the Pro-Arte on this particular guitar as well, but the sound of both sets are excellent and both project very well.\n\nMy recommendation is that these strings are well worth trying to see if the are the ones for you. I will definitely buy another set of these to make another comparison in the future. Great sounding strings.", "summary": "Clear, balanced sound.", "unixReviewTime": 1410652800}

Sweeney", "reviewText": "There is only one reason to give it five stars: it is a hundred-dollar instrument, and I have some deep philosophical objections to them. That said, this is as good as a hundred-dollar instrument can be. No, it is better than you should expect. It's a three-hundred dollar instrument masquerading as a hundred-dollar instrument.\n\nWhat it isn't is a quality student instrument. There's no magic trick to getting one of those cheap. Hundred-dollar instruments are a disservice to the student and an insult to the instrument. The way to make one cheaply is to automate everything possible and to remove the skilled work that is necessary to really set one up properly. That means quality is all over the map. It may play out of the box, it may play if you rework it, it may never play at all.\n\nDon't go this route as a young student or parent. You don't know enough to overcome the shortcomings, you won't be able to get repairs, and it won't stand up to hard classroom use. Rent from a specialist in student instrument rentals, or spend for a real student-level instrument from one of the two or three manufacturers who still stand behind their own names (like Yahama). Getting a cheap instrument for a student is a bad idea. You risk them being unable to learn, blaming themselves for the shortcomings of the instrument, being driven crying from music. You risk it breaking just when it is needed most. I wish there was a simple way around it but band instruments aren't just carrying around relics of a Class Society that prices them out of the range of most of us; they are intrinsically hard to manufacture. It can look like a trumpet or violin, have all the parts in the right places, and still be devilishly difficult to play and sound like garbage when you do.\n\nEnough of the lecture. Where these instrument makes sense is for the experimenter, the dilettante, the gigging musician who needs a throwaway for a switch part or to take to the playa or throw in the vacation bags. What you need is the skill to fix what can be fixed, the talent to work around what can't be fixed, and the fortitude to throw the whole thing in the trash if neither of those works.\n\nThing is, from my (limited) experience Cecilio/Medini breaks the odds. I've gotten two instruments off them and both shipped as perfectly workable introductory instruments. I'm not saying this trumpet doesn't have stickiness in the third valve slide, a little air leak on the main slide, less than perfect plating, and a generally cheap feel and sound. But it was plenty good enough to learn trumpet on as an adult and will play fine in experienced hands.\n\nSix months later it hasn't corroded or lost any parts and the valve action (always the critical part plus the first thing to go) is still good. So, yeah. If you or your child is taking band next semester then hell no. But if you are a clarinetist and want to mess around with the Dark Side then, sure; it's enough to see if you like it and maybe do a little pickup gig while you figure out if trumpet means enough for you to drop $1200 on a used Conn.", "summary": "To ISO or to not ISO", "unixReviewTime": 1526428800}

It tracks synthesizer and Eurorack oscillator signals beautifully in all three display modes, including across a wide range of octaves.\n\nIt's very small, and light weight. It's made of plastic, but if it isn't abused, it should last for some time. It's getting four stars versus five simply because of the plastic versus metal design (which in fairness, I knew about when I bought it).\n\nSo, for synth players, especially those with modular synths, who need a quality, reliable tuner that handles synth signals across a wide range of octaves, give this a look.", "summary": "Great tuner for modular synths", "unixReviewTime": 1457740800}

Thinking they were the same, just that the XD was an older model, and that the 10\" open back cabinet would be close in sound, because it was the same family of amps, I was very dissappointed. As far as I know, the XD and newer X2 combo, both use a different type of speaker, as well as being a 10\" open back, compared with the X2 \"stack\" using a 12' sealed enclosure. This all adds up to a very different sound. I haven't used the newer X2 combo, so I can't say how it sounds compared to the stack, but the older XD has a very different sound IMO.\n\n This cabinet has a Celestion G12P-80, which seems to be a Celestion Seventy 80 (8ohm). I've read is a rather common speaker for lower budget modeling amps, as it's a fairly neutral speaker. Though I am just repeating what I've read. I'm sure there are better cabinets that would sound great with the head, but i'm sure it'd would be more expensive. Some of the other lower budget cabinets i've looked at use the same speaker in theirs as well.\n\nThat said, after using my first X2 setup really liking it, selling it, then getting the XD combo, really not liking it, and now back to having the X2 stack again, I think I've learned to appreciate it even more, and love it. This cabinet is pretty perfect for the X2 amp head. I think it has great cleans and bass, and with the voices on the amp just makes some greats sounds right out of the box, at least ones I really like anyway. I have never been too sure how well the voices on these amps match the originals, but I like the voices either way. The more I play through this amp and cabinet, the more I love it.  They just work together fantastic. I've added a pic of the amp and cabinet next to a strat so you can get an idea of the size of it. I hope you love yours as much.\n\n******************************************************************************************************************\n\nI use this with the Super Champ X2 HD, as intended, you can read that review to know about the amp.\n\nIt is a nice size cabinet, and fits the head perfectly. It's a closed back design with a\nCelestion G12P-80 speaker. For the type of music I play, I have found it to sound very good, although some high gain sounds probably won't sound there best through this. Still I'd suggest you find one in the store and try it out with your gear if you can, you may be surprised.\n\nI have only had it about 6 months, and haven't used it as much as I would have liked, so I'm still breaking it in and getting used to it. I think it is a good match with the X2 HD head. Are there better speakers out there, sure, but some are as expensive as the whole amp and cabinet together. The cabinet itself is well made, and is solid. It is covered with the same black vinyl(tolex???)and cloth as the head, but has no corner gaurds, and sits off the floor maybe a half an inch or so. All in all a good match for the X2 head.\n\n***UPDATE***\nJust wanted to update this review, as I have spent some time playing through it lately.\n\nI still think this is a great cabinet, and well suited for the XD head, I just find it a bit bass heavy. Not in the whole bass range, just certain lower frquencies seem to really over power the speaker a bit. I guess it's the drawback of a closed cabinet, but overall it's not a huge deal, and common with most sealed cabinets.", "summary": "Perfect addition to the Super Champ X2 HD", "unixReviewTime": 1343260800}

Namely, warm thick blankets of massive blues-fuzz overdrive. It skews much more toward the classic solid state crunch, which is of course what it is. Maybe it's unfair to expect it to sound any different, but that's what the marketing promised, so shame on me for believing it.

The unit is a stereo device, but has a single input marked \"mono\" if you only have one lead, as you would with a guitar. My main interest for the use of this device was in my digitizing studio to remove noise from really noisy sources, like old cassettes or noisy LP records. There is an input switch labeled for guitar or audio. All my tests were done with the switch in audio. The noise reduction is quite impressive. The manual states that the Hush can be configured to decode Dolby B recordings. The noise reduction available can be compared to a dbx. This is a single ended device, meaning no encoding is necessary. That being said, if you're not careful, the adjustments can be overly aggressive and make the source sound dull. My method of adjustment was to play a blank tape without Dolby and set the threshold control to just where the noise was down about 20 db, then adjust the gate so the light was just on, a nudge past where it was flickering. This achieved, to me, the best performance without degrading the original sound and taking away too much shimmer from the highs. The difference between on and off is striking. I have several other single ended noise reducers. Phase Linear, BSR and dbx, and none of them are as good as this HUSH. Rocktron claims some patents for the HUSH. These guys have it right.", "summary": "HUSH Means QUIET!!!! This Thing Works!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1506816000}

However, I had no idea that they would sound so darned good! I'm hearing a few things that the Focals didn't provide, but there are clear benefits to the Focals as well.\n\nAt first, I just unpacked and connected these. After being astounded by what I was hearing, I began playing some CDs (yes, CDs) through them. There was a tremendous amount of detail, the timbre of instruments in acoustic jazz and classical work was excellent. However, I listen to rock an metal, so I popped on some prog metal. Dream Theater's \"Awake\" was literally awakened by this pair. The bass reproduction was amazing for a 5\" mid, though you need to place these at least 1ft out from the wall behind them in order to avoid any muddiness, or low frequencies running together. The tweeter was never harsh, and even metal wasn't fatiguing to listen to over long periods. These are amazing.\n\nAfter listening for a while, I checked around my wiring just to verify the sensitivity switch was correct, and IT WASN'T! So, I switched to +4dB (connected to \"pro\" level outputs), and the sonic character changed from being pleasantly forward, to far more recessed, but still very good. Personally, I believe I liked them better in the wrong position, so I wrote to JBL about what I heard, and what they did from the factory, and look forward to their response.\n\nThe bottom line is, I will probably keep these, and A/B them with my Focals when I get the repaired one back!

I do like the gauges better, but it comes down to cost in the end. When you're changing strings every week/ every show (which could be every day), it adds up.

This is your deal.\"\n\nI strongly disagree.  You can find MUCH BETTER distortions for $100 or less, even a few near or under the $40 mark the DS-1 is currently priced at.\n\nI've played guitar for over 10 years.  Like many people one of my first pedal purchases was the DS-1.  Afterall, everyone talks about them, they're available at any given music store in the nation, you hear about all these famous musicians using them, plus a DS-1 is actually pretty cheap!  So I snapped one up just like everyone else.  Come to find out that just because something is POPULAR, that doesn't always mean its GOOD (see: Nickelback, the Transformers movie franchise, the Kardashian family, etc...).\n\nSo I plugged it in and didn't really care for it.  The distortion was harsh, thin, artificial sounding and always noisy.  I tried it on both my amps (My practic amp: a solid state Fender Frontman 25R, and my big amp, the B-52 AT100, which is a 100w tube halfstack) It was was not very diverse, and the basic sound was not very likeable to me.  I've read the Japanese made DS-1's are better in sound than the newer, made in Taiwan models but, either way, the DS-1 is just not a great pedal in my mind.\n\nBut, like many newer players, I didn't know any better at the time.  Fast forward a few years and I've bought and sold literally dozens of pedals.  There is a whole world of great tones to be found out there if you keep your eyes open.\n\nSo here are some pedals I currently own that I like much better than the DS-1.  All of them are great general purpose distortions, easy enough to find new and used in most guitar shops, and can, at the time of this writing, be bought brand new for $75 or less here on good ol' Amazon.com, and are rugged enough to last for years:\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Boss-DS-2-Turbo-Distortion/dp/B0002CZV8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Boss DS-2 Turbo Distortion</a>:  Lest I catch any flames from people thinking I'm a Boss hater (I'm certainly not, I loved the TU-3, the ODB-3, the MD-2, and the XT-2, among others) I'll start with the DS-1's big brother.  This pedal has a much nicer tone to it, not to mention 2 distinct distortion modes.  The I setting is pretty much a higher quality DS-1, the II setting is a brighter, richer tone.  As the DS-1 completely overshadows the DS-2 in popularity, you can find DS-2's all over ebay for very cheap prices.  A very worthy pedal, unfortunately overlooked by many.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Pro-Co-RAT2/dp/B0002MSQVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Pro Co RAT2</a>:  Great dirty distortion pedal.  Probably my personal favorite.  You've heard this box used on literally hundreds if not thousands of songs in the last 30 years, its used by just a ridiculous amount of guitarists.  Its a rich, full distortion that at higher gains gets slightly fuzzy.  I've never heard a bad tone out of mine. Its great for getting a \"big amp\" kind of sound out of a small practice amp.  Its also great for pushing a big amp with too much headroom into the overdriven sweet spot without having to crank the amp volume.  A truly excellent pedal.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/EHX-Little-Big-Muff/dp/B000T517Y4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">EHX Little Big Muff</a>:  The Big Muff is another pedal you've heard on hundreds of songs.  Its kind of a fuzz, kind of a distortion, but definitely owns its own sonic territory.  Very big, saturated and warm.  Used heavily in the 70's for classic rock tones, also in the 90's and beyond for tons of grunge and garage.  Used by everyone from Carlos Santana and David Gilmour to the Smashing Pumpkins, Dinosaur Jr. and Jack White.  I personally reccomend the Little Big Muff, not only is it a touch creamier in tone than the recent NYC reissue, its smaller, uses a regular 9v adapter and its CHEAPER!  A great pedal.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/MXR-Distortion/dp/B0002E520C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">MXR Distortion +</a>:  The Distortion + is a great first distortion, and can usually be found pretty cheap.  Whats nice about the Distortion + is that it sounds great on anything, and the lack of a tone knob helps keep it somewhat transparent, i.e. you can more easily hear the natural tone of your guitar and amp, it doesn't cover over your equipments sound.  Used by quite a few famous folks, including the Greatful Deads Jerry Garcia, Randy Rhoads (Ozzy's famous guitarist) and Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Danelectro-CM-1-Cool-Cat-Metal/dp/B000A40NAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Danelectro CM-1 Cool Cat Metal</a>:  Make sure you get the Cool Cat Metal, NOT the Metal II.  That's a fine pedal as well, but its definitely more of a traditional metal pedal.  The Cool Cat Metal, or CM-1, is actually a very very different pedal from most metal pedals.  Basically, its a pre-amp that sits on the floor.  It has a fully adjustable EQ with tons of volume and gain through the roof.  So you can do anything from a clean boost (with the gain at minimum there is virtually NO coloration to your tone) to high gain metal stuff, with plenty of great overdrive and rock tones in between.  It works well with any amp I've tried it on, and you can find tons of great sounds.  Its an unbelievably versatile pedal, and its even true bypass.  The best part is, Danelectro seems to have made way too many of them, so you can easily find one used or even new for under $30.  A true hidden gem that's actually CHEAPER than a DS-1.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Joyo-JF-03-Crunch-Distortion/dp/B005LYIW3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Joyo JF-03 Crunch Distortion</a>:  This little guy surprised me.  Its supposedly a clone of the MI Audio Crunch Box, and, if so, that must be one awesome pedal too.  Its essentially a Marshall stack in a box, and boy does it ever succeed at that.  Great crunch, tons of volume and gain, it really can make your practice amp sound like a big ragin' stack!  It even sounded good going into my modeling amp (very few pedals work well with my modeling amp, and this one even sounded better than the Marshall simualtion built in), and you can get a brand new one for $40 shipped, fantastic!\n\nSpeaking of Joyo, I've had a few of their pedals as well as one or two from MOEN, another Chinese pedal maker, and I'm honestly floored by how nice they sound given their shockingly low price tag (especially the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/MOEN-MO-FM-Fuzz-Moo/dp/B007L5PVI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">MOEN MO-FM Fuzz Moo</a>&nbsp;which honestly out Big Muffs every Big Muff I've ever played through).  So JOYO and MOEN, they both make a variety of great sounding fuzz, od, and dirt pedals, check them out (and before anyone gets all up in arms about supporting a Chinese company, please keep in mind that NONE of the pedals listed in my review, DS-1 included, are made in America, let alone the western hemisphere).\n\nHopefully these suggestions give you something to look for.  Also, if you can't actually try a pedal out at the store, YouTube is great place to hear demos of what different pedals can do.\n\nI should also mention that if you try and love the DS-1 and it suits your needs, than more power to you.  Tone is subjective, every pedal sounds different running through different guitars and amps, and just because I may share different opinions on something that you love, that's okay.  My main reason for posting this lengthy review is to give newer players some information.  You have PLENTY of options for distortion pedals, the DS-1 is NOT the only thing out there that's affordable.  Find something you truly love and buy that.  If its the DS-1, one of the pedals I've mentioned here, or anything else, the important part is that it sounds right to YOU.", "summary": "Wish I knew then what I know now...", "unixReviewTime": 1309392000}

If you hate how you sound, you will not continue playing. Micro BR has all this and more. There is NO EXCUSE to not practice, when you use this device. You can use headphones, when you can't play with an amp. You can run this between your guitar and amp, when you need to. Any time you have 5 minutes to run some scales, etc. Micro BR is there for you. Quick, easy no hassle. Just plug in, pick an amp model or effect and noodle away. You can record your practice sessions, to track your progress. The interface is confusing, manual not well-written. However, when you learn to use it's myriad functions, you will LOVE this thing.

The latency when switching from phrase to phrase was eliminated by a firmware update, and the labor part of the warrantee was upped from 90 days to a healthier 2 years.\n\nWith those improvements in mind I have changed my rating from three stars to four stars, although I am still not wildly excited about the RC-3. I am currently using it with a Zoom G3X, which can compensate for some of the RC-3's shortcomings. The G3X allows you to dial in a tempo, and it has 40 high quality drum beats (still not enough AFAIC). I've ended up using the RC-3 simply to record and loop what comes off the G3X and have dispensed altogether with the RC-3's inadequate rhythm features. The G3X also has a simple looper that is very convenient and useful when you want to try something out quickly without messing with the RC-3.\n\n-------------\n\nOriginal Review:\n\n3-1/2 stars, really. It's almost a great product, but considering the relatively high price it's disappointing that Boss cut corners and didn't get some of the details right.\n\nThe good stuff about the RC-3 is obvious and easy to find online--it loops, has lots of memory and I/O, is easy to use, and is excellent for practicing and song writing--so I'm focusing on the less obvious bad stuff:\n\n- Various online sources, including, until recently, the Boss and Roland websites, claim you can specify tempo incrementally. Unfortunately this is not true. There is no tempo display and it's tap tempo only, which is a pain in the neck and really ticked me off, because it was one of the few things I was careful to check on the Boss site. At the very least one should be able to fine tune the tempo in 1 BPM increments with the increase/decrease buttons, even if the tempo isn't also displayed, but you can't even do that. And no, you can't use the pedal to tap in the tempo--you have to get down on the floor and use the dinky little button.\n\n- The drum beat and tempo reset to their defaults if you change the phrase number, even if you move to a blank phrase. Sorry, but that is plain dumb--it means you can't record several versions of the same thing, or different parts of a song, without re-setting the beat and tempo. BUT, as noted above, you can't set the tempo numerically, so it's impossible to get the same tempo.\n\n- Built-in time signatures are 3/4 and 4/4 only. No 7/8, 5/4, etc. Boss's marketing department was inspired on how to play this--the web site says, \"You can also specify the time signature.\" Uh, thanks, but the choices, which Boss conveniently neglects to mention, are almost as limited as the color of a Ford Model T. (\"Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black.\") I should add that one of the 4/4 beats is a 12/8 shuffle, and that one of the 3/4 beats is a 6/8 shuffle and another is 9/8, but that doesn't excuse Boss's mendacity. It's clear they are trying to hide their product's shortcomings.\n\n- The 10 built-in drum beats are very basic and are not adequate. There's a reason you can't listen to them on the Boss site, but as a public service I have made recordings available [links deleted by amazon. Try searching soundcloud for Boss RC-3 Drums]. There are actually 20 beats, since there are versions for 3/4 and 4/4, but with all the storage space on this thing, surely Boss could have included more. Even the previous model, the RC-2, had 30 (?) beats.\n\n(Yes, you can go to the trouble of recording and importing your own rhythms to get any time signature and pattern, but you lose the pedal's convenience advantage. Besides, recorded rhythms are part of a loop--they can't be re-used without re-importing, the number of measures can't be changed, and the volume can't be adjusted independently of the guitar playback. Maybe there's a way to hook a drum machine up to the second input, but I can't think of how you would sync/trigger it.)\n\n- The 5 year warranty is parts only. Labor is only 90 days. Labor rates are $40/hour. Return shipping is on you, and if you choose not to get the repair after receiving an estimate, then you are charged $25 anyway. It seems that warranty information is hidden on purpose. I could not locate it on the Boss site and even the documentation that comes with the pedal does not state the warranty period or detailed terms. It's a wonder of obfuscation: \"... this product will be free from defect in materials and/or workmanship from the date of purchase until the period of time indicated for this product.\" Uh huh. And what \"period of time\" would that be and where would it be \"indicated\"? Well, I eventually found the actual warranty terms on rolandus.com: [URL deleted by Amazon. Try googling rolandus warranty]\n\n- Power supply is not included by Boss, although some retailers include one.\n\n- When you switch between phrases, there is a short lag, so you can't string together phrases to make a song in real time. See this youtube video: TlKDHsauvos\n\n- Buttons are mushy, rubbery stuff like a tv remote. Probably saved on costs, but the durability is questionable.\n\nOne other note: I'm using the RC-3 in a Line 6 Flextone I guitar amp effects loop. That way I can overlay loops using different amp effects and amp models. Unlike the Jamman Solo, this is not a mode that is mentioned in the instructions. I think the RC-3 is designed to go before the amp. Amp effects loops are usually line level, while stomp boxes are usually instrument level, so whether it works probably depends on the effect loop's impedance (line level can mean different things and likely varies by amp) and whether the RC-3 can handle the signal coming out of the preamp. Well, nothing's fried yet.\n\nUPDATE 2/21/12:\nA minor issue: When a recorded loop is transferred to a computer, a drum/tempo track is not included. You get a Stereo WAV (41.1 KHz, 16 bit) of the guitar. So, if you want to use the loop in, say, Garage Band, or import it back into the RC-3, you will have to add drums. Getting drums to sync up on the RC-3 is difficult unless the loop was recorded at the default tempo (120 bpm) or is relatively short. If not, eventually the drums go out of sync, because, as noted above, there is no way to dial in a tempo.\n\nUPDATE 7/27/12:\n- Supposedly cannot be used with headphones. There is a dire warning in the instructions that the headphones could be damaged, but Boss does not elucidate how. I tried it anyway. It works, but you need a mono to stereo adapter to hear the output in both ears (or something more complicated if you are using both of the RC-3 inputs), and the output is weak. You have to turn the volume up all the way up to get a barely reasonable volume, so I don't see how the headphones would be damaged.\n\n- Do not try using this with a power supply daisy-chained to other pedals or a headphone amp. It generates all kinds of horrible electronic noise, including a high pitched oscillation and in-tempo thunks.", "summary": "Almost Great.

I was seriously wrong!  I'm not using midi so the suggested fix simply had no effect.  I already had a Blue Icicle XLR to USB converter, so I used it with the XLR output on the Yeti Pro.  Wow!  It was at least 5x louder than the Pro's native USB output (based on waveforms in Audacity).  I also discovered that the mic sounds terrific at a distance of about 2.5 feet -- perfect for webinars.  Yet, I had to give up important features when using the Icicle (stereo, headphone monitoring, mute, etc.), so that wasn't a permanent fix.  I called Blue Microphone and discovered that the Yeti Pro is intentionally designed not to have anywhere near the gain of the standard Yeti.  They tell me that's because they expect the Pro to be used in applications with high sound pressure (drums, guitar).  That's great, but I want to use the mic for webinars, web classes and voiceover.\n\nThe good news is that Blue Microphone offered to perform a \"gain update\" to lift the gain of the Yeti Pro to the same level as the Yeti.  However, I have to send my microphone back to the company and wait 1-2 weeks for the modification.  Bummer, but it's worth it.  So why 4 stars, given all the hassle?  I started with 5 stars for sound quality and features and then subtracted 2 star for the gain update hassle, but added 1 star back because Blue Microphone owned the problem and offered a fix -- 4 stars total.\n\nJust a note for Blue -- since you can set the gain either high or low, it would be wonderful to have a \"hi/lo gain\" switch on the next iteration of this microphone.\n\nBTW, I can't use the Yeti Pro on the same desk as my Macbook Pro without the optional shock mount.  The provided stand picks up vibrations from my fan and keyboard and that results in a seriously loud background hum and clicking.\n\nUpdate: I received my Blue Yeti Pro back from Blue this week.  They made the mod to make the mic as sensitive as the silver Yeti and it sounds great with voice.  Now it works as a webinar and video recording mic.  I tried it with singing and concertina today and, yes, it overloads very easily.  But I expected that.  I also tried using the headphone output to play iTunes songs via the usb connection, but it sounded terrible -- very thin and echoey.  So, I learned that the headphone jack is OK for monitoring the mic, but not for monitoring my computer.\n\nUpdate: May 15, 2013.  I lowered my rating from 4 stars to 1 star today.  I just received a replacement mic from the factory today.  It works fine through the xlr connector, but the USB is totally dead.  I tried two MacBook Pros and both recognized the mic and provided a USB driver, but neither computer could get any sound out of the mic.  And that's after a gain modification to increase the mic's sensitivity.  To recap; first no gain - to the factory for gain mod -- then no USB sound -- back to the factory for a replacement mic and gain mod -- now new mic has no USB sound.  I'm at my wit's end.  I'll call Blue Microphone again tomorrow.  They haven't ignored me in the past and I'll still raise my rating if I can just get a good mic.\n\nUpdate: May 20, 2013.  Total fail.  After talking with the Blue folks, we got to the point where they just didn't know what was wrong with the mic.  The symptoms were no sound on two of my MacBook Pro's and great sound on another MBP and a Mac Mini.  All had the latest OS.  I could send it back to Blue a third time, but they didn't think another replacement mic would work any better.  The Blue people were responsive and concerned, but just didn't have a fix.  So I returned it to the vendor for a refund and bought an Apogee One.  To summarize:\n\n1) The Yeti Pro has about 10 db less gain than the Yeti, making it useless for webinars, Skype and podcasting.\n2) The Yeti Pro does not work with all Macs.  It didn't work on two of my Macs and others on the web report the same problem.\n3) Blue Mic has a free factory mod to fix problem 1, but has no resolution to problem 2.", "summary": "Sorry Blue, This Dog Won't Hunt", "unixReviewTime": 1363824000}

With the rubber piece not serving this purpose, the cable is likely to fail much sooner than it should. I tried to force the rubber piece into the connector but was unable to.

Michael McIntyre", "reviewText": "I bought this case for my Crdoba C5-CE, because the factory-supplied gig bag started falling apart after one trip outside the house.\n\nThe fit around the perimeter of the guitar is excellent.  It's very snug and secure, and there is just enough room for the electronics to squeeze in.  The fit at the front is tight enough to leave string impressions in the lining on the lid of the case.  The fit at the back is just a touch loose with this guitar.  I don't think it's loose enough to matter, but I wouldn't want to use this case with a guitar that was any thinner bodied than this one.\n\nThe compartment under the neck rest is typical for a guitar case in that it isn't big enough to hold much more than a few packs of spare strings, a string winder, some picks and so on.  Since this is a classical guitar case, it would be awesome if it had a compartment somewhere big enough to store a foot rest, and that is the one big thing I will miss about the gig bag.\n\nThe case came packaged in a flimsy piece of black fabric by way of shipping materials.  I can't remember the name of the fabric, but it's the kind of stuff they staple under boxed springs.  It's kind of thin and gauzy, and tears easily.  I think that fabric was basically just there to protect the brass tone hardware, and provide a place to stick the shipping labels and so forth.  I'm amused that they shipped the case in what amounts to a wisp of nothing, and it survived all the abuse between here and China completely unscathed.  I think that says a lot about how this case is going to hold up, and I think I made a good investment.\n\nI'd love it if it had more storage room.  It's a minor quibble, and I'd give it 4.5 stars if that were possible.", "summary": "Fits a Crdoba C5-CE very well", "unixReviewTime": 1379548800}

If you own a Authentic Series Martin, Clarence White Model Martin, 1934 D SCGC or Tony Rice Model, CW Collings - you really really got to try this. I tried this on my D18GE and D28 Authentic 1941 Martins - WOW is all I said. Then I felt guilty owning more than 1 guitar. These strings increased my volume, sustain, clarity for each note. I didn't expect these results. If you are skeptical - just buy 1 set and give it a try. Spend a few weeks with them. I guarantee if you love bluegrass or flatpicking you'll buy these again. Even if you don't like bluegrass, these will improve your guitar.\n\nNote: These are bluegrass strings - more like Medium gauge - if you have a OM or small body guitar - they may not be recommended by the manufacturer. Also if you only played with lights, extra lights, or electric guitar - you may need time for your fingers not to hurt. If you play mediums already, you should have any problems adjusting to these strings.\n\nThey are nickel based strings.", "summary": "This has cured my GAS", "unixReviewTime": 1419120000}

I was totally blown away so I \"invested\" in the 12\" version for my Fender Mustang 2. I was again completely blown away at the huge difference in the complexity of the tone. I had changed the stock speaker many times previously and had settled on the Tonker  and loved it but it was a tad too aggressive/loud for practice if that describes it. The Gold is just perfect. I think it is the best modeling amp available period. I have auditioned a lot of well known speakers and they all seemed to be really good at something but not all things. The Gold is great at everything I can throw at it from super clean jazz to power metal. I was astonished when I could hear the spring reverb ringing clear on the Mustang as the notes carried and trailed. I would have sworn there was an actual spring tank set in the Mustang. It is very much like investing in a 4K TV. The detail is just freakishly amazing. I HIGHLY recommend the Gold if you want to hear the subtleties of your playing and equipment. The Gold is fairly linear (small upper mid bump in a good way) and has no harshness at all. Bass is all there and not flabby. It does sound great a bedroom volumes as well. My speaker/tone quest is finally over - Hallelujah!! It would have been so much cheaper if I would have started with the Gold. There is a reason this speaker cost so much... it's worth it! I have spent a ton on guitars, pickups amps etc to find the perfect tone and convenience at the best price and it turns out to be the Fender Mustang v2 series with Celestion Gold speakers. DONE!

I set it up to sit on my desktop, approximately 2' away from me and used&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Camtasia-Studio-8-Download/dp/B009AYOWXI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Camtasia Studio 8 [Download</a>] and a free program called CamStudio to test it out.  Both programs worked well with the mic and did what I'd hoped it would do - eliminated my need for a clunky, wired mic headset.\n\nThe build quality of the mic seems excellent, and the compact design is fantastic!  I love that it comes with its own carrying case and that it can be on a desktop or clipped to a laptop's monitor.\n\nKINKS IN MY SYSTEM: MUFFLED AUDIO\n\nThe included software: Cakewalk's Music Creator LE can be installed on one computer.  You get 30 days to register it.  I installed it and registered it immediately, but it would not allow me to put in my registration code, saying I wasn't the system administrator.  I am, and my Windows 7 PC says I am, but alas, it wouldn't work.  This software is optional, but I decided to install it prior to the microphone (per instructions) to try it out.  Eventually I ended up uninstalling it.\n\nSoon after installing Cakewalk, I had a PC issue: muffled audio recording.  No amount of system tweaking seemed to fix it.  I was stumped.\n\nThen I decided to go to the Samson site and see if there were updated drivers for the mic.  The generic ones installed were from 2010.  No luck.\n\nI began reading online about 'muffled audio' on Windows 7 PCs.  Somewhere I noticed a name I recognized: RealTek, which was a name associated with my speakers on my PC (RealTek digital audio).  I went to the RealTek site and noted updated drivers for Windows 7 64-bit (2012), and decided to download and install them.  I rebooted my PC and tested out the audio recording once more. Much to my delight, this solved the muffled audio problem!\n\nI did set the bitrate to the highest level for the best sound quality recording.  Afterwards I tested out the mic using Camtasia and CamStudio, both worked beautifully with the Samson Go Mic!\n\nOn my desk at a distance of about 2.5', this mic pics up my voice perfectly for dictation and screencasts.  No hiss, hum, breath noises or distortion.  Very clear and with the properly installed drivers for my audio - works perfectly with the USB 2.0 connection on my powered USB hub.\n\nCONCLUSION: BUY IT FOR GREAT RECORDINGS\n\nThis mic is a truly great if it's recognized and properly configured by your system.  Impressively clear recordings, unlike any I've been able to obtain using a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Plantronics-Audio-655-USB-Multimedia-Headset/dp/B001SEQN3K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Plantronics .Audio 655 USB Multimedia Headset</a>&nbsp;or the mic on my&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Microsoft-LifeCam-Cinema-720p-HD-Webcam-Black/dp/B009CPC6QA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Microsoft LifeCam Cinema 720p HD Webcam - Black</a>.\n\nFor the price, I don't think you can do better.  It's compact, has great voice pick-up and audio recording clarity. Installation issues may occur, but updating audio drivers, using a powered USB hub connection and tweaking audio settings within the operating system should give you the quality you've been hoping for at a price that's right.\n\nUPDATE: 12/30/13\n\nBeen using this mic consistently for a couple months and I'm liking it.  It's a condenser mic, and doesn't filter out ambient noise as well as I'd like, however for an under forty dollar purchase - I'm still very happy with it. Cakewalk never has registered correctly with my system so I uninstalled it.  I guess if anything, that's been the downside to this purchase.", "summary": "Problems with Win 7 audio drivers, but once resolved, stellar performance", "unixReviewTime": 1381449600}

I love the short scale neck (works great with my stumpy fingers) .  The bridge is the most weighty bridge I have ever seen on a bass.  The short scale and the configuration of the bridge work great for palm muting and thumping the heck out of it.\n\nThe bass comes with round wounds that can be pretty rough on your left hand if you haven't been playing for a while.  I plan to change these out for roto-sounds, which are quite a bit smoother for one's fingertips.\n\nGreat value.\n\nUpdate 7 months later.  I still love the bass.  After a 3 hour gig where I had been playing pretty hard, my finger tips were pretty sore.  So I checked the strings with a micrometer.  The low E string seems to be a .105 and the G strings measured at .048.  So I will be changing these out to a lighter gauge string, and we will see how that works out.

For those that may be reading this wondering if it's worth a try, I would say YES. I have been impressed with the light so far. It is different than your typical Chauvet SlimPar(which I also use). This light has a wider beam angle and works well as a wash light rather than a \"beamy\" uplight in my opinion which is what I wanted. I compared it to my SlimPar 64s and these are the pros and cons of what I found:\n\nPROS:\n-While it's not a metal body, the hard plastic finish looks like it could take a beating( I wouldn't mistreat it, but just saying)\n-The beam angle on the light is slightly wider than that of a normal SlimPar which I liked because I didn't plan on up-lighting with these anyway\n-The All-In-One LEDs are far superior for your variety of colors rather than the individual LEDs where you would have color blending down near the light and the true color as you go up.\n-I have to say that the brightness of the LEDs hold there own against any other LED Par fixtures and the dispersion is great as well(No hotspots)\n-It's DMX capable with a variety of colors including a white which is beneficial\n-It's got a built in fan for cooling that runs constantly(some would say a noise issue, but not for me as I will have music and sound while I'm using them anyway)\n-They are a price friendly light and a bang for the buck!!!! If they have the life-span of the normal 50k-100k hrs, these are definitely worth the buy!\n\nCONS:\n-While the light is impressive, I wasn't impressed with the braces that hold the light. They're pretty flimsy compared to the thicker braces on my other fixtures. They work okay on the floor and while it's not a complete deal breaker for me, it would have been nice to have a sturdier bracket to use when hanging the fixture above.\n-While this light does have the capability to daisy-chain to another fixture, there is no normal plug outlet like on the SlimPar. In order to daisy chain, you have to purchase a separate NEMA to IEC cord to plug in another light. I don't know why they don't supply one with the light, but that would have been handy especially if purchasing multiple lights.\n\nAll in all, the light is fantastic for the amount you pay for it and the brightness you get out of it. I purchased (2) fixtures as a test run before buying more, but I will say that I will be purchasing more as a cost saving measure! I would recommend them for sure.", "summary": "This is Definitely a BANG for your BUCK.....", "unixReviewTime": 1463961600}

Be sure to size accordingly and don't buy a violin figuring your child will grow into it. Get the right size for them now and they can play it for some time. Too small is okay, too big is not.\n\nThis violin is so cute, it was difficult to not dip it in chocolate and eat it. Pretty sure it will be a wall hanging after she outgrows it.\n\nFor such a tiny instrument, it is a completely functional violin.

Very easy to manipulate and more solid than other competitive product cheap knobs. The fact that this unit is USB 2 means that the recording quality can be far superior than USB 1.1 units that are going to limit whether you can do high quality recordings on multiple channels. The midi interface works great also in Acid and Sonar. The unit definitely will cause your laptop battery to drain faster if you are using mic inputs with phantom power but that is fine by me for the great functionality. Line in works fine but if I had any minor complaint it would be that it would be nice to have an effects insert interface.

I like the sound of the Suzuki better both have great comfort of the mouth area.  I play Jazz on Chromatic so if you are a classical player this review is not the best. However, that being said the Suziki requires more cleaning at and you need to be careful to keep it warm so the wind savers do not stick. After a while and the slider on the Suzuki gets a bit stuck on first push when you pick it up (Ok after the first push) after not using it for a day. My Saxony has had 3 notes fail I guess from fatigue and the spring broke from fatigue so I have had reliability issues but I do practice a lot with it still it is less than 2 years old. On the plus side Seydel service is really excellent. I am not an expert but I would say that the stainless steel reads do not hold up compared to the brass in terms of fatigue. They have a different sound and the Saxony is louder. I practice on the Saxony and perform on the Suzuki. So I am not a stainless steel fan. Just got an Ozone cleaner by Ioncare, hope that helps. If I had to do it over, I probably would not have got the 4 octaves, but sometimes you run out of notes so it is good but may be hard to keep track if you are not playing by ear, that is finding where you are while playing. If you do get the Saxony, don't get the high pitch one (forget what that is called). It is too high and I was able to return it. I also own a Super Chromatic 64 which is another terrific instrument on the economic side. This is very bendable and love the sound and I would rate that highly. I also own a Honer CX12.

They used it to simulate bagpipes and I always loved that sound. I finally purchased an EBow about a year  ago. I'm a songwriter and record my own demos at home. I also perform live in a cover band. I don't use the EBow very often but when I do, it really adds to the performance. I recorded an EBow track for an original song in a passage where there was only acoustic guitar and it added another dimension to the overall sound and made my recording sound more professional. For live playing it can be a little tricky because sometimes it takes a few seconds to get the strings to start vibrating. With practice, I think this could improve. I play the solo on STP's \"Sour Girl\" and it sounds very much like the original recording. People in the audience tend to take notice during that solo and I get questions about how it works. I have not had good luck with arpeggios but again, practice could improve this. The octave switch is great for a controlled feedback sound. Battery life is exceptional. I have only had to replace the battery once. Overall, I think this is a great product.

Within a week of playing, for about 1-2 hours per day, I barely had any pick left. I buy 12 packs of regular picks for around the same price as this single one and each pick lasts me about a month (provided I don't drop it or misplace it). I did really like this pick, though.

I've tried 10-52 but the top is a little too floppy for D and that makes notes sound out of tune if you don't press the string just right. Also tried 11-56 and while that gives a real solid and full rhythm tone, the attack is too rounded due to the pick taking longer to travel over a wider string. That reduces articulation. So while you get a fuller sound with the 56, you get more dynamics and attack with the 52, and the latter makes metal rhythms sound heavier. You can EQ fullness into a rhythm track, but you can't add in pick attack and greater dynamics.\n\nTension wise, at D standard 11-56 is ideal but 11-52 is doable. Sound wise, 11-52 has been best for my metal recordings and that's why I'm sticking with the EXL116 set from now on. I also replaced the G string with a 20 gauge wound for better sounding power chords.

Anything under $150  NEW will be a problem to learn on and that is fact.  It can also be said that if you want to buy a truly PROFESSIONAL mandolin you could spend as much as $3000 to $5000 and more.  However, if you want to buy AN ENTRY LEVEL PROFESSIONAL MANDOLIN don't go crazy....simply buy The Kentucky KM 505.  I have played guitar for over 46 years and mandolin for over 25 (on and off).  These days I am playing more mando than guitar.\nI have recently been through more than a few mandos in my attempt to get back on track.  I went through an Eastman MD 304 and 305.  A Gretsch G9350 Park Avenue F4 oval hole and a The Loar LM 170.  I liked the Eastman and the LM 170 but the Eastman neck was too narrow but did have a nice radiused fretboard and the LM 170 had a wider, non-radiused fretboard which was okay but the V-taper of the rear of the neck WAS A KILLER ON THE WRIST.  The KM 505 has a nicely radiused ebony fretboard with the same 1 1/8th inch nut width of the LM 170 but with NONE of that horrible V-tapered neck.  The 505 has a more comfy rounded neck that is easy on the thumb and wrist.  The woods are all hand carved and beautifully grained (I have the lighter tea-burst finish version with the pickguard).  The binding is exquisite as is the pearl and abalone inlay on the headstock.  The tone is full and woody without any tininess (note the Eastman, The Gretsch and the LM 170 all had good tone as well).  But on consideration of all the attributes of a good mandolin the KM 505 stands out of the crowd.  This, for me, was a step up.  In fact, this mando should hold me until I can afford (if ever) an Ellis or a Weber...or maybe I will just stay with the Kentucky.  Buy one...you will not be sorry.

I have owned a few Fender tube amps in the past and I can honestly say the modeling is spot on (without the tube inconsistency) on the Mustang series. The Twin Reverb and Deluxe models are particularly accurate representations of the original amps. I run my Mustang V.2 through a Randall 4X12 cabinet that I re-wired for stereo operation and it sounds fantastic. The head runs 75 watts per channel in stereo so you get nice lush chorus effects with good separation if you run it on a stereo cabinet or dual cabinet configuration. The amp features a wide array of on-board effects which can be configured and saved as presets and accessed via the 4 button pedal which was included with my amp. You can also add another 2 button foot switch to run with the 4 button unit or run the two button switch with an expression pedal. So Fender gives you lots of options for configuring this amp to your needs. The included software is very functional and expands the amps capabilities even more. I use both the Ableton Live Lite Fender edition and Amplitube software and I get amazing near studio quality recording results running this amp directly into my laptop. The amplitube software is cool because it allows you to access the amp models by way of a graphic interface that is an exact reproduction of the original amp. I have used the amp in live gigs and it provides plenty of volume, while maintaining consistent sound quality at all times. I play a very wide range of music and this amp does all genres very well. Blues, Jazz and Metal are my main genres. The White Chapel preset is perfect for my 8 string guitar metal work. The Twin Reverb with a touch of chorus and my Stratocaster is a blues perfect tone and that only scratches the surface of what this amp can do. Take the time to learn what this amp's capabilities are, don't just settle for the presets.

I tried changing the strings, and it still sounded a little tinny.  Compared to my full sized dreadnought, the sound felt thin and at times as though it was heavy in the treble end, and lacking in bass qualities.  It also couldn't project nearly as well because of the smaller size.\nI like to with fingerstyle and am going for a folk type sound, so I'm not hammering the strings with a pick.\nI decided for the price, I would give the o-port a try, and I'm so glad I did.  I chose the small size in ivory to complement my pink sunburst guitar.  The sound hole measurement was the smallest option.\nInstallation was easy.  I loosened the strings (without a capo as the video suggests) and just spread them to the sides for installation vs. pulling the bridge pins.  It took some serious folding/squeezing and manipulation to get it in to the sound hole.  The ring is much larger than the hole, so that extra material has to go somewhere to get it in.  The piece is malleable plastic as described, but it has a rigidity to it as well.  I got it in just fine, but then had to use a thin tool (smooth end of nail clipper lever) to coax the part of the o-port that lacks a rim out of the guitar to fit along the inner edge of the top of the sound hole.  At first it kind of folded to the inside, and since there isn't a lip on that part, it stayed in until coaxed out.  I wasn't sure at first, but then I remembered it's job is to smooth out the interior of the guitar, and if there is a ripple of any kind it can't do that as well, so I worked it out.  It fits very snugly, I am glad I don't have any plans to remove it because I believe it would be a challenge.  It fits very snugly into the sound hole, and would be hard to find a edge to lift.\nThe final step was to tighten and tune the strings.  Total installation time was around 5 minutes.\nOnce installed, I immediately noticed a change in the sound.  So did my children, and they aren't musicians.  The guitar sounds richer and fuller as described.  The thin tinny quality I sometimes had seems to be replaced by tones and harmonics that are much more pleasing to hear.  The guitar is also louder.  I don't have to play as hard to get a louder sound.\nOverall, I feel like my guitar just got an upgrade.  I don't plan to gig with this guitar, but I love how it sounds now.  For all of you who have a smaller sized instrument, consider an o-port if you want a passive, inexpensive way to improve and amplify your sound.\nFWIW I'm currently using Martin Silk n' Steel strings.\n\nTwo weeks later, and a friend who had heard the Daisy Rock before the o-port heard it for the first time with the o-port.  They didn't know what changed, but noticed the guitar sounded much nicer.", "summary": "Noticible difference in my Daisy Rock Short Scale Dreadnought", "unixReviewTime": 1471046400}

I thought it looked way too green at first, but now that I look at it, it looks fine.  Now about the sound of the guitar.  It sounds very very nice.  It has really clean sounds with the stock strings I think, unlike another reviewer.  I got some Slinky 9 strings though because I hear they are good.  I will use those for backup.  It does come with a cable to connect it, and 2 allen wrenches.  The cable is far too short I think so I bought another one.  I think it's only 10 feet long.  The guitar itself I think weighs less than my old Fender Acoustic.  That's saying something about this guitar.  I bought it mainly because of the finish and all the positive reviews it has on it's weight.  I remember an old beginner guitar and that thing weighed a ton.  I really like the weight on this thing.  So, after my short review, I would say if your looking for a great sounding electrical guitar that is pretty light with a good price tag, get this one.  If you want an all black finish I would continue your search.  I just found out they make an all black guitar like this one.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "12 22, 2010", "summary": "Excellent guitar for your money!", "unixReviewTime": 1292976000}

Here are my insights in these areas but these are specific to mine.\n1. The sound: My ukulele has a sweet sound that is neither overly warm NOR brassy. This quality can be varied with different strings (String Material such as Fluorocarbon, Nylon, etc. dependent) and as mentioned several times in other reviews, is \"Spot On\" for intonation.\n2. The Set Up: I found that the Kala was set up at a great string height (I Researched the recommended string heights on line and was surprised to find Kala was at the mid point of the recommendations). One thing I have learned is that if the instrument is physically correct, you still need to \"Fine Tune\" the set up for your personal wants. The Kala allows this but straight from the box so to speak is outstanding.\n3. Quality of work: Looking with a very critical eye I found nothing negative. The glue points had no over runs and all surfaces/edges were without flaws. The Tuning Machines were smooth and hold their position well. The inlay work is outstanding as well.\n\nIn a nut shell, my Kala would be a great deal at twice the price I paid, and I am totally happy with it.", "summary": "Well worth the money is an understatement...", "unixReviewTime": 1337299200}

Something about the weight and contour is just more satisfying than that of the SM58. Of course, I have used SM58s that were well over ten years old, and I've just pulled the Q7 out of the box, so to speak; so the jury is still out on actual durability. As far as sound is concerned, the discernable difference I was anticipating between the SM58 and the Q7 never materialized.\n\nAll in all, as a multi-purpose stable mic, I am happy to add the Q7 to the herd.

First off, it has a really nice weight to it. The satin finish on the body is what really sets it apart from the glossy versions, in my opinion. It gives the guitar such a better look. The neck feels great. And I mean great. Very smooth feeling when you're playing and running your hand down the length of it. The pickups are ok, I think they are meant to be changed anyway. They do sound great with the right amp though.\n\nThe inlays look dope, no complaints there. The head stock is nice too. The knobs are fine, the tone knob gives some variety for your sound, and the volume knob is simply that. No coil tap ability but that's fine. The strings go through the body, as can be seen in the pictures. It's a nice touch, and it does increase sustain. Obviously this is not something to rival the very expensive ones. But with the right upgrades, it has a really good chance to do so. I will definitely be keeping this one.\n\nUPDATE: It has been about 9 months now that I have had this guitar. I still love it. Ended up changing the strings to 11s (Ernie Ball Power Slinky). For metal those strings just work better in my opinion. None of the guitar parts have come loose or apart. The inlays still look good as new. I was a little worried when I first got it that the headstock would break. This is because it is set at a slight angle compared to say a Strat-style guitar. I've traveled around with it in a hard case and softer gig bag, and so far no problems. However, I do treat my guitars as if they are my babies so that plays a big part. I still have no complaints about this guitar. The only thing I would change are the pickups but I get the sound I want by adjusting the amp settings, so it's not a big issue for me. Would still recommend this guitar for players of any level.", "summary": "Great", "unixReviewTime": 1478563200}

I promptly took that guitar back to GC and asked them for the one on the shelf that I played. So: if you order this online take some time to really inspect it before committing to it, there may be some quality control issues from one to the next. That said I am otherwise quite pleased with the bang for the buck the guitar is giving me. I often take it to the park with me, and it has already suffered a cosmetic casualty that earned my son a good scolding but hasn't affected the playing. I put Ernie Ball Hybrid Slinky strings on it which are a custom 10, 13, 17,  30, 42, 52 and it's remarkably playable for \"lead\" as well as rhythm.", "summary": "\"Campfire Guitar\"++", "unixReviewTime": 1401926400}

The Mackie 802-VLZ3 fit within my budget so I bought it, knowing I'd return it if I wasn't satisfied.\n\nI brought it home hooked it up and listened to music 2 hours straight, extremely pleased with the quality and low noise of this unit.

The tone is really rather impressive with an accurately intoned and complex sounding lower end and a ringing and brilliant high end.  Overall I'm very impressed, and not just because of the price.  It can stand in comparison to a wooden instrument, but a wooden instrument would definitely sound more rounded and resonant-but thats what you get by spending upwards of 1000% more.  Also there's the added benefit of not having to care meticulously for it.\n\nAny complaints about intonation are really poorly founded.  A wind instrument of any sort (at least that I'm aware of) will never play perfectly on pitch when you simply blow any stream of air through it.  Its always possible to be a little flat and more likely a little sharp even on a blockflute type instrument like a recorder.  That said, a good instrument will limit the discrepancy by which you can be sharp or flat and still produce a sound, and this recorder does that quite well.  You do have to wield it with a good sense of control, but after getting your feel for the instrument down, that should come quite naturally.  This instrument is worthy enough to be recorded or performed with other A=440 instruments and sounds.\n\nAny one who likes playing recorder should definitely pick this one up.  It's cheap, more portable than a soprano, very fun to play, and definitely worthwhile for anyone with a serious musical intent.  This is the smallest size recorder that can be easy played by someone familiar with the larger sizes.  The garklein really is a pain in the ear and a pain in the a$$, but still fun for a gag.  The finger spacing on a sopranino should be comfortable with average sized hands or less, and workeable so long as you are not Shaq or Andre the giant.

The product is durable and holds together fine. A minor complaint that I have is that the \"U\" shaped pieces don't hold tight very well, actually not at all. They swivel a full 360 degrees, but the good thing is that it doesn't fall off the frame, they just spin around when my guitar is not resting in its place. There is a small groove for the pieces to fit into the frame and it won't just \"pop off\" at any given time. There is a knob on the back of the main pole that is easily adjustable for raising the height or lowering it, if you choose to. The stand will fit almost any size guitar you can think of, I have a Dreadnought and it is more than adequate for its purpose. The tripod legs collapse downward so that you may fold it long ways and stuff it under a bed or in a nook inside your closet when not in use.

The most prominent problem with them is the sound quality... they are quite \"honky,\" making vocalists sound much more nasal than they really are.

Virtually every other microphone we tested sounded better. And I'm not talking about comparing it to $3500 Neumann U87 mics either... more than half of the mics we used were under $150. Other, better choices in a similar price range are the AKG D5, Heil Sound PR 22, or stepping up to the Shure Beta 57, which is much, much better.

I promptly went to my local music store to talk to a professional about it. He told me that there is only one truly amazing vibration tuner: the SNARK tuner. Desperate for a tuner, i bought it and was amazed. It was very easy to tune with, especially when you are tuning into special tuning. It worked with my Bass, with out having to switch settings and was more visually pleasing than this one. After about a month, i dropped my snark on hard wood floor from a few feet, and the clamp cracked and broke. i pulled the head off and it still works as long as it is touching the instrument.\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\nDont buy this tuner, it is total crap. Buy a SNARK clip on tuner.", "summary": "Get a SNARK tuner instead, this is garbage.", "unixReviewTime": 1381968000}

Plus xlr is not locking. Meaning accidentally you can pull the cable off and you would lose recording.\n\nI also did a sound test.\n\nMics: Sennheiser MKE600 on line 1, Audio Technica AT8035 on line 2, both are set on mic stand and about 2.5' away from the computer monitor that is playing a feature length film of mine from 2004 that was ADRed. The setup is in our current decent ADR room, so it's quiet enough.\n\nBoth Tascam and Zoom were providing phantom power to the mics\n\nI was at the other room with the door closed, without doing much of setting adjustments on either devices (assuming an indie filmmaker like myself would not have time to go and carefully set each as needed). I have only set recording to 48khz/24bits.\n\nOn Tascam I have the gain set in mid and the dial at 3pm line (both channels)\nOn Zoom, I have the dial set both on 5.1 (it's hard to get exact as I was having seeing issue - old age).\n\nVolume on both are set high for headphone.\n\nso as you can see, the setting is not ideal but assuming that I'm going to be running to set a shoot at a location and with the chaos I may encounter when it's a one man crew or two men crew set...\n\nbtw, mounting the Zoom right above the camera is not a good thing cause you can't see the dials or the screen (when tripod is set at 5'6\" tall). You will need a cage or additional hot shoes support to mount the Zoom and the mic around the camera (DSLR in this case), where as the Tascam can be mounted below so with limited crew members, it is a fairly practical setup than the Zoom. both limiters were set off and such.\n\nI made sure the audio from the monitor is of the similar lines to gage the recorded info. Tascam picks up better audio than the Zoom did (maybe the settings were not correct). I do like the packaging of the Zoom plus how it saves the audio into two mono files unlike Tascam saving it the two tracks into a stereo file with 2 channels.\n\nPlacing onto Premiere CS6, as it is, audio audible but quiet, not hearing much of differences, then I added normalization to both to -12db, Zoom sounded good but with a lot of noise... (some friends of mine told me that the H4N had noise as well, so not sure if this is the same issue or new problem).\n\nAlso: I did notice that for practicality wise, using the Tascam for a one man crew shoot would work best while the Zoom H6 is not feasible to access or read the screen when it is mounted above the camera. (Unless you use one of the magic arm).\n\nQuick disclaimer: I'm not an audio engineering, but just an indie filmmaker that does a lot of stuff around Ohio and have learned to always have good audio with video (or worst case to do ADR... NOT). So I try to invest in decent mics and make sure get good audio that helps my visual creation... I did these tests on practicality and real-life environment since not every shoot will have a perfect sound, perfect room, perfect environment, etc...", "summary": "Look nice but not practical", "unixReviewTime": 1376006400}

They are \"good mics to use and reasonably priced!\"\n\nThe voice professionals recommend this mic along with the studio and sound techs. The idea of this mic is to be super quiet. I was told it eliminates most backround noise by itself, wich allows me to sit outside of my sound booth and use it. It really is silent once you use it when isolated.\n\nSome other mics i have used (but do not own) cost between $700- $1300. This includes deifferent style shotgun mics, and more wide angled range mics. The E100s really stands up to these more expensive mics and produces great quality sounds.\n\nFrom the nice box it comes in, to the built in rubberband-style shock mount, right down to the classic and crafty looking USA made microphone; it really feels good knowing I have a good peice of equipment that my customers think sounds great.\n\nAs far as setup I did have to fiddle around with where to place the mic as upsidedown did not work well for me, and the sound must be relatively straight on. I also need to use phantom power 48v. on my MIDI interface, as it needs power to work. Be sure to have a pop- filter, and the CAD E100s will be amazing.", "summary": "Classic example of quality; CAD E100s", "unixReviewTime": 1288051200}

But it looks great and sounds great.  I don't need a $500+ acoustic... I'm not playing live shows.  This is just something to strum away on when I don't want to use one of the electric guitars.\n\nThe coolest thing is that the sunburst color really pops.  Epiphone did a great job on the paint.  The sides and back are just medium stained while the front is black with the orange burst.  There is trim around the body pieces.  The pick guard needs a good heavy wipe since the plastic sticker leaves residue.  The Epiphone E is proudly displayed.\n\nGuitar stays in tune.  Comes pre-strung with decent strings.  I prefer a slightly lighter gauge, so these will be changed as soon as these start wearing.\n\nIncludes a truss rod which you should NEVER use.  I don't know why they included it.  You can literally snap the neck if you don't know what you are doing.  On a guitar this affordable, I just play with the factory setting.  But if you want to raise the neck (to make the strings closer to the fretboard) then please have someone do it who is experienced with this process.  Otherwise it's a $120 mistake.\n\nCame packed tightly in a good box, wrapped in protective covering and padded with much bubble wrap.  Does not include any picks or capo or extra strings.  No case.  No strap.  So basically it is the guitar as is.  No frills.  Which is good, because I hate paying for cheap accessories that I won't end up using or just replacing anyway.\n\nIf this if your FIRST guitar (congratulation on getting a terrific guitar from an amazing brand!) I recommend getting picks if you so desire (I use Fender medium gauge celluloid).  Also a strap if you want.  A capo is important for many songs, so make sure to get one soon.  And a tuner - mainly I use it when re-stringing (make sure it can tune both electric and acoustic - you set it against the guitar for acoustic and plug in for electric).  Avoid a lot of the lumped together bargain deals on Amazon, these are usually lower quality.  And a stand and case are also nice.  Make sure to stow the guitar away from traffic areas since acoustics are much touchier than electrics (mostly), knocking it down can do irreparable damage if it dings the body, especially the back.\n\nBottom line: don't get one of those off brand sub $100 guitars.  I have read too many horror stories.  Epiphone crafts good guitars and I have played many of their instruments over the years.  My favorite guitar is the Epiphone Les Paul Classic (in black!).  And since I don't want to spend $2500 for the Gibson version, Epiphone is just fine.\n\nUntil you hit about $350, this is arguably one of the better guitars out there.  At $350 you can get some amazing Yamaha acoustics and can even select your body material (love the mahogany).  But sub $300, there are a couple of Fenders and a couple of Ovations that are good, but this is a solid choice.\n\nMy one negative is that this is made in China and then inspected in the US.  But for this price I guess you can't get an American or Japanese made guitar.  Sadly those are going to start at about $500 for most quality brands.", "summary": "Great value!  Overdelivers!

Even though I already had bought a Trophy 11 inch flutophone and was practicing with it, I also purchased this product to determine if I could also play this smaller flute.\n\n Even though this song flute was made for children first starting out in music, as a rank beginner myself in playing musical instruments this is a handy little music maker. The Conn (Selmer 981) Song Flute is made from strong plastic, black in color and 9 inches long.  As soon as I got it I began to practice with it. The sound is okay but not great and even though I have very little experience with this particular flute I was able to play a few songs with it.\n\nThe small size makes it easier to carry with you than other musical instruments.  Fortunately, this product came with a basic instruction sheet.  It works on the same basic music theory as the Flutophone and similar instruments and I was able to play a few songs with it.  The basic lesson sheet  was very helpful and I also ordered a more detailed song book on playing this song flute.\n\nIf you are presently studying the flute or similar instruments, you will be able to play some music with this song flute.  If you are looking for a fun little flute, you may want to check out this model.  Keep in mind this is not the greatest musical instrument.\n\nRating:  4 Stars.  Joseph J.

I play through simple classics - a Fender Hot Rod Deluxe or Marshall AVT50 (both modestly priced, great amps for different reasons, but IMHO, pretty hard to beat the Fender...).

The quality of my amps was plenty for me, but I was missing out.  For the right songs and compositions, this pedal makes it darned hard to put my guitar down.  I'm still more of a purist, setting the amp to modest presence and reverb, but seriously, the Carbon Copy is that nice.  Anybody who tries it is hooked in a few measures.  A few simple licks turns into a few songs, and pretty soon you wonder how you got by without that sound.\n\nSimple, clean, warm, no hiss, no buzz.  Other pedals worthy and affordable - EH Little Big Muff, Boss Super Chorus, Korg tuner, and your choice for a preamp booster for solos (my vote - blow off the snobs and get an affordable Behringer preamp booster pedal) and a compressor pedal to keep it all even.

This unit can only supply about 3 or 4 milliamps before the voltage drops to an unusable level.\n\nWhat this means is that while it may power some microphones sufficiently, there are quite a few that demand more current to operate correctly and because of this unit's internal design, it simply cannot provide the current necessary for proper operation.\nThis may be why some reviewers have reported that the unit didn't operate...the mic or device that was hooked up to it needed more current than it could deliver.\n\nSo, while it may work well enough with some simple Phantom-powered microphones, be aware that it might not work at all for your application.", "summary": "Great Idea, Poor Execution!", "unixReviewTime": 1473638400}

This has tap functionality and up to 3 seconds of delay time. 2) It comes with the ability to modulate your sound to some extent, creating chorus and flange-like effects. 3) It has a boat load of other functions, like loops, reverse effects, etc. 4) It's programmable. 5) I like Electro Harmonix products in general. 6) It's relatively inexpensive for what it has. 7) It has stereo-ins and outs. 8) It doesn't suck tone and signal strength. 9) It looks great.\n\nI guess you could see this as a list of the pedals \"pros.\" Thus far I've tested in out for only 2 hours or so, but it's lived up to my expectations. It actually has way more functionality than I wanted, but I'm looking forward to exploring and creating new sounds. For about two hundred, this is a great deal.\n\nThere are a few \"cons\" and they are: (1) It takes a while to learn how to use. The manual is _essential_ here. Right off the bat it tells you how to get a simple delay. I demo'd it in the store (Guitar Center) and I couldn't figure out how to get it to work. It was creating all sorts of crazy loops and I couldn't even shut the loops off! It was totally going crazy! So, if you don't know what you're doing, you shouldn't mess with this pedal. Fortunately, the manual looks very clear and although long (10 pages or more?) I think after I read through all of it I'll be clear on things. Actually, the fact that the pedal was going crazy when I demo'd it was cool, because now I know I can do all that crazy stuff (not that I'd really use that in a gig).\n\n(2) It's only adaptor-powered, no possibility of battery use.\n(3) It's digital. If you absolutely must have an analog delay, then you might check out the new MXR Carbon Copy, which is a bit cheapter, is smaller and is analog. Everyone says it's a great pedal. However, it can't do any of the other cool jazz this baby can do, and doesn't have tap tempo. Or for more money -- about three hundred -- you can get the analog Memory Man which everyone raves about. Or a Maxon delay. But the sound on this is close enough for me, and the analog delays don't have the features this one has.\n(4) You can't switch presets with your foot. You have to bend down and turn the Hazarai (white) knob. You could raise the pedal to where you could reach it with your hand, but then you can't stomp on it (for the tap tempo). I'm not sure what to do with this conundrum just yet. Probably I'll only have 2-3 presets that I'll use in a gig and I'll just have to reach down and turn it when I have to?\n\nIn conclusion, I did a fair amount of research on delay pedals and demo'd a few in stores. For the money, I think this is a good pedal. It has 2 extra knobs more than a usual delay pedal (not counting the Hazarai knob) and that lets you adjust your sound to make it more analog-like or add some reverb-like effect, which is neat. It's functional, wacky if you want it to be, and it looks great!\n * * *\nEdit: I have now owned this pedal for about three months. It is great, and has loads of possibilities. Only thing I miss about it, is that it lacks an easy way to switch presets (you have to bend down and turn the Hazarai knob and push it, which you can try to do with your feet, but it's pretty hard!).

All the harshness of an under saddle piezo transducer is gone.\n\nI recently used it at an outdoor gig and was very pleased with the sound running through a small mixer and a single powered speaker. My other guitar player in the band was just using a standard active direct box and I could hear a big difference in tone. We ran out of XLR inputs, so I ran into a stereo line in the mixer and it sounded really nice. Since I didn't have phantom power, I had to run on 9-Volt battery and the 1/4' output to the mixer. And the battery life is great. I played a 3-4 hour outdoor gig and never had to change the battery. Unplugging the input jack while I went for a break probably helped. Also, the build quality is excellent. Wish the gain knob was more easily accessible, but perhaps there's a really good reason they designed it this way. I would like to compare this to the Radial Piezo D.I.\n\nThis would be my first recommendation to anyone needing a great sounding direct box/acoustic pre-amp. It's more on the pricey side, but well worth it. Find a used one in good condition to save some dough. Hope this helps.

Maybe a 9V but AAA's??!!\n- Accessing the batteries requires a philips screwdriver (not a big deal but 1 more thing to carry?)\n- If it at least used a 9V supply, then you could connect a 9 adapter cable and run it from a pedal board.\n- If you forget to unplug all the cables after every use, batteries will be dead fairly quickly. This makes it impractical to mount on a pedal board permanently.\n\nSummary\n------------\nIt's ok. It's an AB (A or B) pedal, it's fairly cheap, has a small footprint and it works well. I have had mine a long time but find I almost never use it because of the lack of power supply jack. You might think that is not a big deal, but if your rig is complicated enough to need an AB switch you probably have a pedal board too. And if you never want to mount this because it has batteries, accessed from the bottom, with a screwdriver, then you, like me, may find it sits on the shelf.  It's ok in a pinch, but I don't think I'd put it on my pedal board.

I use a Mackie DL1608 mixer which has the Onyx preamps...and they are good...but I have to turn the input gain up to around 8/10 to get usable level with the OM-7's.  Enter the CL-1.

The difference in audio quality/clarity and level was unbelievable.  I know the unit doesn't inherintly have any 'coloration' but it certainly does something...I dunno if its just the clean gain or what but it really cleans the mic up.  I asked my wife to do a blind A/B comparison with one of the monitors I had hooked up in the garage between the Audix and the Neumann and she couldn't tell the difference.  I'd say that's pretty impressive.  If you use low gain mics like the SM7B (which I have as well) or the Audix OM-7 this box is a must have.  Just get it and don't look back.

{"overall": 3.0, "vote": "47", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "11 15, 2014", "reviewerID": "A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA", "asin": "B00JA8QD40", "reviewerName": "frankp93", "reviewText": "I checked out the jamstik website, FAQ, and forums before selecting the item to review. From the promo video, I'm a far cry from the intended demographic but here's where I'm coming from, for what it's worth:\n\nI've played guitar for 40 years, including MIDI controllers going back to the Roland GK-1/GM70 and the GR-55 guitar synth with a GK-3 pickup. I record using software, external and software-based modeling amps, as well as tubes and transistors. I also play keyboards and use various kinds of MIDI controllers.\n\nIn its favor, the jamstik has some unique expressive potential. The overall workmanship is quite good; it has some real mass to it and  doesn't look or feel anything like a toy. The flat-bottom design let's you rest the jamstik vertically on surfaces, which is a nice touch when working with software.\n\nThe latency of the optical sensors compares well to hexaphonic pickups and converters I'm familiar with, such as Roland's.\n\nIn spite of the Apple-centric marketing, the jamstik can be used with a Windows PC as a USB MIDI controller talking to music notation applications  such as Finale, Sibelius and Notion (in fact, this was my motivation for trying it out). Finale 2014 detected it right away as a `jamstik' MIDI input device. Be aware it may be necessary to transpose input an octave higher in the software (the buttons didn't map), but that's not a big deal if you've used smaller-range controllers - and it still  beats entering individual notes with a mouse.\n\nBut there are limitations and quirks to consider:\n\nFor playing, the five-fret range is unfortunate, although obviously a tradeoff for portability and perhaps comfort and more room for the picking and strumming hand. I have to believe that for every person who thinks \"nice, compact, convenient\" many more will think \"limited\".  There's an argument to be made that if you're starting out on guitar, limiting your possibilities is a good thing. But the counter argument is it's better to invest in something you're less likely to outgrow quickly or feel constrained by.\n\nThe strings on the jamstik are described as `real guitar strings' and this is partially true: They do feel like middle-of-the-road electric strings with familiar looped rollers at one end. But the opposite end that sits in the body of the jamstick is not standard at all - it's a kind of soldered flat disk, designed to hold the strings in the cavity. The bottom line is, you can't use ordinary guitar strings on the jamstik and it's worth looking into the availability and cost of replacements. While breakage may be less likely because the strings aren't tuned to pitch, per se, they can still become cruddy from oxidation, sweat and dirt.\n\nSpeaking of changing strings, lefties (such as myself) are out of luck with the jamstik for now (the website indicates a lefty version is in the works). I ignored an online warning that switching strings wasn't straightforward due to the sensors - I've converted a lot of righty instruments and wrongly assumed the issue was convenience rather than design capability.\n\nYou can physically swap the strings using the supplied Allen wrench (hidden under the lithium battery - weird) to unscrew the six head bolts and remove the guide pieces holding the strings and springs. The center cover piece can be gently spread from its side mounting slots and the strings raised out of their guides. The strings are inserted from the back like a Strat.\n\nAll was for naught however because the optical sensors in the fingerboard are `hardwired' to produce `right-handed' pitches, regardless of string order.\n\n(I'm into electronics and will probably take the thing apart - lots of circuit bending possibilities here - but I don't think that's appropriate for this kind of review.)\n\nI eluded that strings on the jamstik don't transfer actual pitch; they transfer location that's converted into MIDI pitch information. You `tune' the strings by turning the Allen bolts at the head to establish the amount of tension you want to feel. Out of the box the string tension felt quite tight (like the high end of a harp) and unnatural compared to any guitar I've played. But after loosening the bolts I was able to get the jamstik to feel much more guitar-like allowing easier pressing and string bends.\n\nThere are many options for playing a guitar through software these days and a fundamental question is how important is it to feel as though you're playing an actual guitar, even when the sounds you make can resemble virtually any instrument (or sampled sound) you can imagine.\n\nAn electric guitar - even without amplification - still sounds and feels like a guitar: The higher up the neck you play, the higher the corresponding pitch and `tighter' the string tension as a result of reduced string length. When you pick or pluck a string with one hand, there's a corresponding vibration felt in your fretting hand. The design of the center guides that the jamstik strings pass though prevent this  connection from being felt - it's almost as though you're playing two guitars at once and I find that literal disconnect awkward - it reminded me of trying a SynthAxe years ago (although Holdsworth certainly had no problem with it).\n\nCall it a kinesthetic sense or just feel it intuitively - in my opinion that body/finger/string connection is largely responsible for the pleasure people who play guitars enjoy, and the jamstik lacks that for me.\n\nFor anyone completely new to MIDI and playing instruments through computer/phone-based software, I think it's worth explaining what the jamstik does and doesn't do:\n\nThe jamstik produces absolutely no sound on its own, electronic or acoustic. You can't sit on a plane/train, plug headphones or a headphone practice amp into it and hear anything. It has no acoustic sound such as a Martin Backpacker travel guitar.  Neither is the jamstik an electric guitar you can plug into a real amp or an audio interface to play through amp simulators such as Guitar Rig or Amplitube.\n\nThe jamstik is a MIDI controller: When you play it, instead of producing sound, the jamstik transmits MIDI data representing your performance via USB or Apple wireless to applications that translate the data into actual sound typically using a software-based musical instrument.\n\nThere are applications that take this capability and allow you to interact and learn guitar, trigger and play `non-guitar' sounds, as well as record and playback whatever you perform.\n\nBottom line: The jamstik is so different from an actual guitar, including ways that may not be obvious without holding it in your hands, that I think it's worth careful consideration before deciding this is really what you want.\n\nTaken on its own terms I can imagine someone doing quite interesting things with it. But if you have any expectation of a genuine guitar-like experience playing it, in my opinion, it leaves enough to be desired that I'd strongly recommend trying it out first in person.\n\n(and btw, the box spells 'jamstik' in all lower-case, just in case you're wondering)", "summary": "Guitar-Like - But That `Like' Should Get You Thinking", "unixReviewTime": 1416009600}

I put the flash heads and reflectors in a padded Pelican case. There's still more room in the bag, so I could actually fit four more stands.  I use one side pocket for the extension chords, another for clamps and clips, another for tape and supplies, and the top pocket for notepads, pens, etc.  The only thing that will not fit inside is the 3-piece backdrop crosspiece. The rear outside of the bag has two straps.  I Velcro the three sections together and use these two straps to secure them.

There are two large handles, plus the steel base and top of the cart can also be used as handles. I have about 45 lbs of stuff in the bag and can pick it up and put it in the back of my Honda Pilot easily.

Chan", "reviewText": "Both FC3 and FC4 get lots of stars, and rightly so. Yamaha builds their products well.\n\nSynopsis from reading the reviews and my experience.\n\nFC3\n* Performs well at simulating the pedal of an acoustic piano. Including half pedaling with a continuous  range of sustain and damper control.\n* Check your board's manual for compatibility, as it works only on keyboards that will support the two level sustain function that allows for continuous pedaling.\n* From reviewers- Compatible with P75, P105, P155 and some others.\n* From Yamaha- The FC3 is only compatible with: S90ES/XS, MOTIFXS/XF, P120,140,155,P250, P60, P70, P85/P95,NP30, All CP series digital pianos.\n* All bets are off for use on other keyboard makes.\n\nS. Guzman- \"Even if you have a Yamaha, only certain models are compatible. Many keyboard only have a \"sustain\" pedal input, which is just an on/off switch.\" They may not know what to do with a continuous pedal.\"\n\nmychiros- \" Doesn't work on my PSRe-313. A little research showed that it works with only a few portable grands, most P- models, and a few others. The rest of us need the FC4(similar design) or FC5(cheapest, just on/off sustain) . \"\n\n* On either the FC3 or FC4, If polarity gets reversed there is a reboot method to fix it.\nKen Mabuchi- \" Just unplug it. Turn off your keyboard. Plug in the FC-4. Then turn on your keyboard.\"\n\n* Some complaints of squeaks after extended use.\n\n* Pedal travel- the FC3 has a metal bottom with two strips of rubber pad near each end. My new pedal stays put pretty well on wood, tile and carpet. These single pedals take a lot of stress that fixed pedals might not. When it slips to an odd angle, sideway stress is put on the pivot point. I carry around a 25lb. shot bag to anchor my mic stand and I'll re-task this bag to brace my pedal if it's slipping around.\n\nBuild Quality- I opened up both FC3 and FC4 to see what was inside. Both were well made, but of different design.\n\nIn the FC3 - resistance is provided by a coiled metal spring under the pedal.  To pivot, the u shaped tongue at the pedal's end sticks through a metal bracket's u shaped slot and is trapped there by a screw. Lateral movement seems to be sufficiently stopped by the connection of the spring and by the linkage to the potentiometer. A plastic coupling rod moves with the pedal and smoothly rotates the offset crank pin on the pot (think how a steam locomotive wheel is powered). The up and down travel of the pedal is limited by padded stops. All wear points are lubed with grease. Screws through the metal bottom plate anchor all mechanisms in place to the pedal's plastic body. As for chord stress relief, before exiting the housing, the cord is routed around a bracket and is attached there by zip ties. A simple and good idea that's easy on the chord and could absorb some hard pulls.\n\nIn the FC4 -  resistance is provided by a tough plastic flat spring that arches up to the pedal bottom and flexes when pushed. To pivot, the pedal's tongue passes through a bracket. Rivets on either side of this bracket pass through countersunk holes in the sides of the tongue (reminds me of a desktop stapler). A tensioning bolt in the bracket, below the pivot point, draws the bracket closed onto the axis, allowing some adjustment for wear or loosening over time. A switch, not a variable resistor as in the FC3,  is smoothly tripped on and off somewhere in the middle of the pedal's travel. All wear points are lubed. A slot-in rubber bottom plate seems to slip more than the FC3. Before exiting the housing, the cord is knotted around a screw and then padded and crimped in a metal strain relief.\n\nThis all might be more than you want to know, but it might give some insight into fixing squeaks or for tightening up slop down the road.\n\nFrom my perspective, if your piano is capable of supporting the FC3 you should get one. If you're using a single zone pedal, you're not getting the full potential and capability out of your keyboard. Sustain is important to the piano music and you'll start hearing the subtle difference between the two pedals and perhaps even change your pedaling technique.\n\nMy P155 came with the FC4 even though it supports the better pedal. It would have been nice if Yamaha had packed the FC3, for a cost of only a few more Yen to them. Oh well, that's all about marketing and added profit margin by selling accessories.

I got the it from Guitar Center with a coupon for $49, and the strings for $5 from an ebay seller.\n\nAlso have a Luna Tattoo concert uke (with preamp) that is the best sounding of my ukes, although its intonation is not as good as that of the Kohala tenor.

The quality is excellent and the entire device is very solid, including the keys, pads, knobs, slider, display, buttons, and wheels. To use this, all you have to do is connect it to your computer with the enclosed cable, which is actually a USB printer cable(the part that plugs into the controller is that almost square fitting). The driver will load automatically(my computer is very fast and it took just a few seconds). Then, you have to get your DAW(digital audio workstation), or other software to recognize it. That depends on the software. Most DAWs will recognize it automatically. Usually, the DAW requires that it be plugged in BEFORE you open the DAW. With some DAWs it doesn't matter. Some software requires that you activate the midi input and select from a pulldown menu, often selecting \"graphite 25\". Some software has a \"learning mode\" where you can assign different parts(knobs, sliders, keys, etc.) to different functions(By the way, if you find that a key is not sounding, it may be because you accidentally assigned it to a non-audible function. Before deciding the key is defective, try reassigning it or resetting the device). The display is bright and easy to read. The knobs are very smooth with delicate detent positions. The detents are not so great as to be audible if used to directly control sound(like pitch, for example).\nThe keys are full sized and have a nice feel with well sensed velocity(which is easily adjustable). The keys have a very fast feel with minimal bounce. The keys are semi-weighted, but the plastic key body is minimal and the weighting is close to the pivots, so you really don't feel much weight in the keys. I tested the degree of key bounce and if the bounce would produce a spurious after-sound. There was no after-sound no matter how hard I struck the key staccato nor was there any problem even if I let my finger slip off of the edge of the key after holding it down. However, if I struck the key hard with a glancing blow, slipping off of the edge of the key after striking it in one sharp motion, there was an after-sound. The slight bounce in that case was sufficient to produce an unwanted note. Since that type of fingering is not a normal action, I don't think Samson should worry much about it. But some musicians are bothered by it.\nThe instructions are written for someone who knows a lot about midi controllers. It is really not addressed to the beginner. I think Samson makes a mistake by not providing more detailed instructions for the beginner, explaining how each feature could be used and giving examples. It could be provided in a separate manual. For the beginner, this device can be complicated and intimidating, but that is the world of digital audio! You get used to it after a while.\nThis controller is \"bundled\" with Native Instruments Komplete Elements Software. \"Bundled\" means it comes with a disc so you can download the software on your computer(only one computer download is allowed). The process is not what I expected, being divided into five separate programs. Once installed, the update process involves \"download\" and then \"install\" and during this process, five icons pop up on your desktop, but they go away. After all is done, you are left with five new icons on your desktop. The process takes some time, so be patient. The software works well and does, indeed, supply a wealth of virtual instruments. If you do not have a DAW, you can use this software to play on your keyboard(but Komplete Elements is not a DAW). Each virtual instrument may require some different techniques to use. Some require that you click on the tiny keyboard tab at the top to activate keyboard input. Some will accept keyboard input automatically. Don't forget to try clicking on different tabs, like the \"library\" tab to access all of the instruments in each of the three separate pieces of software(the other two software pieces, each with their own icon, deal with administrative tasks). Fortunately, if trial and error is too frustrating, read the documentation! If you locate the file folders, you will find good documentation in PDF files for every aspect of Komplete Elements. You can access the PDF files most easily simply by clicking on the help tab at the top of each application within Komplete Elements.\nI tried this controller with Mixcraft, Ignite, and LMMS DAWs, as well as other software(Komplete and other stand-alone software. All worked well(with  Korg's M1 le used as a stand-alone it worked after changing the synth's preferences but within Mixcraft it worked straight away). Also, Komplete Elements automatically got sucked into Mixcraft so I could immediately access all of Komplete Elements from within Mixcraft. I could also access all of it from LMMS(using the external plugin accessing feature).(Ignite does not support any plugin.)\nThis is a great, well made keyboard controller and a great choice for those who want more than just the basics.", "summary": "Superb full feature midi controller", "unixReviewTime": 1396396800}

This is one of those instruments. I hope my post helps others, Ive been playing acoustic guitar, bass guitar and other instruments for more than 30 years.\nHere is the breakdown on this acoustic electric bass guitar.\n\nWhat came in the box:\n\n1) On the box, the guitar was made by Sky Enterprise, the model of this bass is 427 for the one that is natural color.\n\n2) The box came with pick guard that has a Self Adhesive sticker on the back. I am glad that the manufacturer is giving the owner the option. To me, I like the way the bass looks without it, but end game... it depends if the player heavily uses a pick or not.. some do.\n\n3) There was no hex wench for the truss rod, however I have ones that fit already.. so no big deal on that.\n\n4) The guitar did have foam wrapping inside, and then just the thin outside box. I think that there should have been another external box for more protection.\n\nPhysical condition / Fit and Finish:\n\n1) Unlike others that have posted, on the one I got... no scratches or other damage. The body is perfect! There is abalone for the rosette, and the front top wood may be spruce, the sides and back very much do look like mahogany.\n\n2) The fretboard is supposedly rosewood, and it was very dry, I put 3 dime sized drops of Old English lemon oil (not polish) to condition the fretboard. The strings were not tight (as they should) so it was easy to rub in the oil.\n\n3) The BC that is on the head stock was very faded, and not to noticeable unless you get in close to the guitar. I don't think that was intentional by the manufacturer, however I very much like the way the logo looks. It's not pronounced. more faded with the wood itself.\n\n4) There is a strap bottom on the very bottom of the guitar and another one of the side of the neck toward the body, not sure if that was added as an after thought as I read some posts here on Amazon that there was no 2nd strap button.\n\n5) The built in equalizer is a model: EQ-7545R which you can find by itself on Amazon. The volume knob does not seem too solid, so be careful about that when your turning that volume knob, the other sliders on the EQ, seem good. The battery check light works. Also note that the 9-volt battery is installed and has plastic wrap on it, so you have to pull the battery compartment out and then take that plastic wrap off..dont forget about that.\n\nSound / Playability:\n\n1) All the frets are fine, they seem to be all the right height.. no dead spots.. nothing. The ends of the frets are \"dressed\", no need to file them.\n\n2) I did have to tighten the truss rod, that that helped bring down the string height. The white saddle the the strings goes over on the bridge, that piece does come out, and I took down half of the material using a dermel rotary tool, then a flat metal file and that also helped get the strings height lowered for better playability. Dont forget to look on YouTube for instructions on adjusting the truss rod and saddle, \"you can\" do the basic set up yourself. It's more of a feel, see and play \"thing\"... more than anything else.\n\n3) Some people in the comments has said that the biggest string, the E string does not sound loud enough when the guitar is plugged into an amplifier. Try adjusting the equalizer settings, take down higher end on the right of the guitar equalizer and then turn up the mid or high on your amplifier, that may balance out the sound more.\n\n4) The bridge looks more like a classical style bridge. It has no bridge pins, only holes that go thru the bridge itself. I went with light gauge D'Addario Strings, which I may return for some phosphor acoustic ones, not 100% on that. Another idea, is Nylon strings. Also to note, buy bass guitar strings that are short scale. Also to add, that light strings tend to be brighter, but the upside of that, they are easier to press down and \\ fret and also less tension on the neck and bridge.\n\n5)  The strings that comes with the guitar, are ok for the short term, but I can see physical imperfections of the strings themselves, like the wounds are mushed up in some areas of each string. There is plenty of new ones to choose from on Amazon.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\n\nThis electric acoustic bass guitar is a Christmas present but I needed to check out that there was not any outstanding issues with it. From what I can see, this is perfect. I have not seen any acoustic electric bass guitars, that the body has that cutaway shape in this low price range..  anywhere. Its definitely worth buying 100% Have a great holiday season! - Tom", "summary": "A great acoustic electric bass, fantastic price !", "unixReviewTime": 1480118400}

It has very low noise levels. The high quality knobs are smooth, not at all loose, they don't ever stick or slip, they have the perfect feel to them as you fade in and out. The faders for channels 1-8 volume and balance/pan controls have a click spot that's evident in the center position (12 O'clock). Even with this handy click position, you can still very smoothly fade the channels in and out.\n\nOne thing pretty unique about this mixer is that there are actually a total of 4 separate true stereo output mixes available: main mix, effects send, monitor send, and mix B (the \"muted\" mix). The 1/4\" stereo headphone output on the front can be set to monitor any of these 4 output mixes. Mix B is exclusively available on the headphone output, while the other three mixes have their own separate dedicated stereo ouputs. This design is very flexible, allowing combinations not possible on a lot of other mixers. The ability to mix to effects send and monitor send independently IN STEREO completely separate from the main mix and mix B is a fantastic feature.\n\nWhen the headphone output is set to mix B, then all 4 mixes (main mix, effects send, monitor send, and mix B) have their own separate stereo outputs, each with their own volume fader knobs. Note that mix B is a special \"muted\" channel mix. Only muted input channels 1-8 will go to mix B.\n\nThe mute buttons are essentially output routing toggle switches, not simply mute buttons. This is a great design. When channels 1-8 are muted, they are routed so that they are only available to the monitor send mix and mix B (the \"muted\" mix). When channels 1-8 are not muted, they are only available to the monitor send mix, effects send mix, and the main mix. Regardless of the mute setting, channels 1-8 are always available to the monitor send mix.\n\nPressing the mute buttons produces no audible click that I can hear, even at full volume.\n\nThe stereo effects send output is a stereo 1/4\" jack. If channels 1-8 are not muted they can be individually mixed to the effects send output using their EFX fader knobs. The effects send mix is stereo, not mono. A lot of other mixers actually have mono effects send outputs. On this mixer, the effects send mix is affected by each channel's volume and balance/pan fader positions. In other words, if you panned an input to the right, and set it at 50% volume, that's the mix that the effects send gets when you set the EFX fader knob at 100% volume.\n\nThe stereo monitor send output on the back is a true stereo 1/4\" jack. Unlike the mono monitor send output in the front, the back monitor send output is actually stereo. And unlike the effects send, the monitor send mix bypasses each input channel's mute, volume and balance/pan settings. In other words, if you mute input channel 1 and set the volume for input channel 1 at 0% and balance/pan channel 1 to the right, and set the channel 1 MON fader at 100%, you will get a monitor mix of channel 1 at 100% volume that's NOT panned to the right or muted. This has caused some people to be a bit confused, and to wrongfully determine that the monitor mix is mono and not stereo, because the balance knob has no effect on the monitor mix. The back monitor output is indeed stereo. I verified this. However, the front monitor output jack is mono.\n\nA great use for the monitor send mix is to allow you to have effects processed audio heard on the main mix that's processed from audio input from the mixer that can't be heard on the main mix. For example, for a great vocoder only effect on the main mix, connect a mic to channel 1, then turn it's volume to 0% so the original mic audio can't be heard in the main mix output. Then set the mic's MON on channel 1 to 100% so it goes to the monitor send's output. Then, using a vocoder on input channel 2 with it's volume set at 100%, which is getting mic input from channel 1 via the monitor send's output, you will hear the vocoder processed voice output on channel 2 that's an effect processed from channel 1 without hearing the original mic output from channel 1. It sounds like you plugged the mic directly into the vocoder instead of the mixer, but you didn't! This type of audio routing is really handy! The effects send doesn't work this way on the main mix. If you did this using the effects send output instead, you will hear the processed mic audio as well as the original mic audio, because the effects send output cannot process anything that's not heard on the main mix even if an input channel's EFX knob is at 100%. These two different audio routing options are very useful for different purposes.\n\nPros:\n\n* 4 individual stereo output mixes (even effects and monitor sends are stereo).\n* Inputs 1-10 are all stereo!\n* Inputs 1-8 can be individually sent to any of 4 different mixes.\n* Inputs 1-8 have individual volume, balance, effects send, and monitor send faders.\n* Inputs 1-8 can be muted (sent from main mix to mix B).\n* Inputs 1-2 have both XLR and 1/4\" inputs.\n* For shelf use it includes soft feet, and removable rack ears.\n* Internal power supply, with removable computer style power cord.\n* Stereo headphone jack that can monitor all 4 different output mixes individually.\n\nCons:\n\n* Inputs 9-10 have only volume faders.\n* Inputs 9-10 can only go to the main mix.\n* The power switch is in the back. This is a minor issue. Since I would never use the mixer without anything else also on that's connected to it, I have no need for it to have a power switch. I use a power strip for that purpose.\n\nIf you want a high quality mixer with a ton of features in this price range, then GET THIS MIXER! I looked at all the others in this price range. As of the writing of this review, there's currently no other mixer available in this price range that has all the features of this mixer.", "summary": "Excellent feature packed mixer", "unixReviewTime": 1393027200}

I'm a professional violinist, and I needed a battery powered speaker for busking and for some gigs where there was no power available.

{"reviewerID": "AMTQJ1ZZ58BO4", "asin": "B0002H03YY", "reviewerName": "Gordon Tubbs", "verified": true, "reviewText": "I regularly play acoustic and electric guitar and so my playing technique is very \"heavy handed\", which is somewhat necessary for playing an acoustic guitar if you really want good intonation and presence. Unfortunately, electric guitars require more finesse and dexterity if you want to get the most of your vibrato or bends, which is why 0.9 to 0.11 gauge string sets are the de facto preference for every player.\n\nBack in the 50s and early 60s, guitar strings didn't come in the lighter gauges that we have them today. 0.12 and 0.13 sets were commonplace. Electric guitar strings were more or less lighter-gauged acoustic guitar strings. This is how the Beatles were able to get those thick clean tones, and how Stevie Ray Vaughan (who also used 13s on his Strat) came to create his legendary tone as well. \"Heavier is better\" is just a myth though. Dozens of guitar heroes use standard gauge strings, sometimes as light as 0.8. It really just depends on your playing style and the amount of physical response you want from your strings. In this case \"heavier is better...\" IF you have a strong picking technique and hard attack.\n\nThese days I have been playing a lot of heavy metal and I needed strings that wouldn't flap around when playing those tight galloping rhythms and alternate picking runs. I decided to try out this \"Baritone\" guitar set on my Les Paul, and I've been really impressed with the thickness of the tone. You don't necessarily need a Strat-scaled guitar or anything longer to rock these strings, so long as you adjust your bridge accordingly.\n\nAnother benefit of using .13s is that the G-string is WOUND, which means more tension and less tuner slippage while playing. Every guitarist knows what I'm talking about when I say how frustrating it is when the G-string slides out of tune more so than any other string. On this set, the G-string is a wound 0.26, so literally twice the thickness of the high e-string. While this doesn't make it totally immune to tuning slippage, it'll get you really close.\n\nThe last benefit of using .13s is that it is like resistance weight training in every respect. After playing a couple months on .13s, if you go back to .9s or .10s you'll feel like you can fly across the fretboard with ease.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "03 25, 2014", "summary": "Great for Heavy Handed Players!", "unixReviewTime": 1395705600}

So I look down and the strap button is detached from the guitar, lying on the floor.

If the strap button does fall off and you avoid disaster you should be able to get a new one put in at your local music store. Second thing; the cord that connects the guitar to the amp - is crap. Again not a big deal you can just buy a nicer one for 10-20 bucks. Third; not sure if personal preference or not, but I don't really like the picks.

Works well with microphones and acoustic-electric guitars, as well as with electric guitars and electric bass guitars.\n\nFeatures are limited; the gain and output level are adjustable, there's a switchable low-pass filter to cut out rumble and wind noises from the mic, phantom power for condenser mics is available, and there's a crude limiter available if you must have one. Like any good pre-amp, it has virtually no sound of its own, but lets the sound of the source come through cleanly. Push it to clipping and you may just hear a tiny hint of tube distortion (\"warmth\").\n\nI dislike two things about this Art Tube MP: it has no on-off switch, and it's powered by an ugly, annoying, space-eating wall wart that hogs two or three spaces on your power strip.\n\nNothing too wrong with this Tube MP, but I prefer a competing product by the same company (ART): the ART Tube PAC. The Tube PAC is essentially the Tube MP plus a compressor in one box. Not only does the compressor make the Tube PAC much more versatile than the Tube MP, especially in live situations, but the Tube PAC also has an on-off switch and an internal power supply (no wall-wart). The Tube PAC is perfect for use both with my bass guitar and with my wife's vocals. The compressor, used subtly, is invaluable in both applications.\n\nMy suggestion: skip the Tube MP and get the Tube PAC if you can afford the $50 price difference. They sound the same, but with the PAC you have a compressor available when you need it.\n\n-Gnobuddy", "summary": "Good little mic preamp.", "unixReviewTime": 1284076800}

It seems they get a bit stuck/pinched in the nut sometimes. Perhaps a lubricant of some sort would help.  Speaking of lubricant, I have used Finger Ease on these strings with no problem, as I do with my regular basses. I love this bass in that I can easily pack it on trips, plus it's just handy to have around the house.  The workmanship is really great.\nThe only fuss I had was locating a case that fits this Hadean.  After returning two cases to different two vendors, I found the one pictured here that fits.

For electric,  .11 - .49 is simply just too much work when bending, etc. (for my puss fingers anyway). Goldilocks tried the .10.5's and said \"not too light, and not too heavy, they are just right\". And the three bears danced till dawn!\" Nice one D'Addario, cheers! GW", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "08 4, 2013", "summary": "D'Addario has the answer!", "unixReviewTime": 1375574400}

You'll need to have your own cord (the one that goes from the guitar to the amp isn't provided as part of the amp package...).

It provides plenty of smooth, even light and is sleek in design.  And the carrying case makes it very portable.  Fits best on flat metal, and has a tight clamp.  I have a portable stand which does not have a flat metal base...so I used a sturdy piece of foam board to clamp to...works great.  The unit uses three AA batteries. I started off using 3  batteries and they do work but light drops off within about four hours.  I prefer to use the 13 foot adapter cord.  I am an older person who has old eyes. Sometimes lower C and lower A look alike.  Mighty Bright Orchestra Light to the rescue!  The clip is also much larger than the image would let you believe; however, the base is curved to allow your music to easily lay on top.\n\nSome comments have indicated that when plugging the AC adapter into the base apparently did not disconnect the batteries as expected. The unit I purchased does disconnect the batteries upon insertion of the power cord into the clip. To confirm this on your unit: (1) DISCONNECT the AC adapter from the wall and from the light, (2) load batteries into the clip, and turn on the light, finally (3) with the AC adapter STILL DISCONNECTED from the wall outlet, plug the cable into the base. The light should go out. If it doesn't, your unit is not isolating the batteries from the AC adapter, and may present a fire hazard if the batteries are installed when the AC adapter is plugged in.", "summary": "Mighty Bright To The Rescue", "unixReviewTime": 1356220800}

It has an elegant design, but it is also quite rugged. The microphone & instrument pre-amp is quiet & clean.  The MIDI IN support is a great bonus. You get all the interface cables needed to hook up for MIDI IN (DIN to 1/8\"), iPad (Lightning or 30-pin to DIN), iPhone (Lightning or 30-pin to DIN) and MacBook (USB2 to DIN). It uses a 9V battery (included) to provide phantom power for a condenser microphone. It plays nice with Garageband, MainStage 3 & Logic Pro X.  While it doesn't charge an iPad or iPhone, the iRig Pro appears to draw very little battery power when operating off their internal batteries. Overall, iRig Pro is an excellent tool for iPad & MacBook Pro/Air users to create music on the go.\n\nNow for some cautions:\n\nThe iRig Pro does not have a built-in headphone amp, thus direct, no-latency monitoring is not possible. In use, overall latency is slightly present, but tolerable.\n\nAs others have pointed out, the provided I/O cables are flimsy and semi-proprietary. If you have a bad cable, you are pretty much chained to buying a replacement from IK Multimedia.\n\nYes, iRig Pro comes with \"free software\", but these are stripped-down versions of their established packages such as Amplitude and SampleTank. They are designed as \"entry-level drugs\" to get business for their expensive add-on packages of effects and instruments.  And no, Amplitude or SampleTank are not appropriate substitutes for good DAW software. The last time I checked, if you need a DAW, the Garageband app is just $5 (yes, I know it used to be free!) and it works fine with iRig Pro.\n\nBTW, the computer devices I am using the iRig Pro with are iPhone 6, iPad (1st Gen.) and MacBook Air 13.3\" (2013-vintage).

This particularly is true if you are going to play lap style slide guitar, because of what they will allow as far as pressure of the bar against the strings, and because of the tonal depth.  When I ordered the D'Addario EJ42 set I was surprised--pleasantly--at the price.  It turns out that these are very good strings:  they hold their tuning quite well and the set has a nice balance from string to string in tension and tone.  They can be used on a round-neck resonator for a combination of fretting and slide playing, but because some players might find them a bit heavy for fretting, they probably are most ideal for square-neck, lap-style playing.  Because the music stores in my area don't routinely carry resonator strings, and because the Amazon third-party vendor from whom I bought the strings offers free shipping, these D'Addarios will be my first choice the next time I need to change strings on my resonator guitar!", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "05 2, 2011", "summary": "Wonderful Resonator Guitar Strings", "unixReviewTime": 1304294400}

One caveat.  I read some of the other reviews and several people remarked that the shaft attached to the desktop would not remain extended if too much music or other weighty items were placed on it.  Based on that analysis, I ordered the recommended Manhasset ShaftLock Model 2400.  When it arrived, I attempted to install it, but it became very obvious that the design of the shaft lock is incompatible with the M51 music stand.  There is a tiny slotted screw on the shaft lock which is supposed to be tightened to the extent that the shaft lock will bind to the black tube below.  You can then turn the twist sleeve on the shaft lock left or right to raise/lower on the one hand or lock the chrome tube in place.  Sadly, since the shaft lock does not bind to the lower black tube, the whole concept fails.  It was annoying enough that the shaft lock had to be separately ordered and arrived several days later.  It was even more annoying to waste the time trying to get it work.  I called the Best Service Store phone number (the people who shipped the shaft lock), but they did not answer the phone or respond to a voice mail message.  I then called Amazon and they quickly sent me a shipping label to return the item and I will receive a credit after it arrives.\n\nAs I nearly always play sitting down, it is not too disappointing that I cannot raise the desktop with any significant amount of weight on it.  For that reason, I chose to give the unit 5 stars.  It is a really a pleasure to use, having used a smaller stand for years.

The handling noise is excellent for those of you using this as a hand held microphone, it's quiet. It's frequency response drops down to 40Hz, making it an excellent choice for an instrument mic also. This will do a good job on close up work with guitar cabs to brass, providing excellent rejection of other sounds, The bottom of a snare or anyplace that you want a high rejection ratio, and can also fit this size of microphone.\n\nSo for those of you looking for it double as a recording microphone, because where you are recording has a high noise floor, it will work out well also.

(The outer winding surfaces were made as normal round wounds, then the outer surface was ground down until the surface was flat-ish.) Yet the tone of these strings retain a noticeable amount of the brightness and overtones of round wound strings. The best of both worlds on a bass if you ask me.\nVery Important!: These medium scale strings fit my Hofner Club bass perfectly.  The heavily wound portions of the strings run from below the archtop's floating, rosewood bridge and then, just past the nut of the bass, these strings quickly taper down to where they DO fit into the holes of the guitar tuning pegs Hofner uses on its basses. The E string's taper at the top is just enough that it fits snugly into the E tuner's post hole.  The other strings, of course, fit into their tuners with more ease. This bass is a joy to play, and the feel and tone of these strings have increased my enjoyment of playing it.\nI was given a Hofner Ignition Series Club Bass for Christmas, though I got it early.  The Club bass is made in the same manner of hollow body construction as its more famous Hofner Violin or \"Beatle\" bass brother, only the Club bass uses the same Les Paul-ish shaped, single cutaway body as the Hofner Club guitar. The natural tone of these hollow body basses has a distinct thuddy, woody character resulting in a tone more akin to the tone of a large acoustic double bass than does any Precision or Jazz bass.  These Hofner basses are 30 1/4 inch scale (15 1/8 inch from nut to center of twelfth fret) basses for which there are notoriously few choices of string sets because of the extra string length needed from the bridge to the trapeze tailpiece.  I have wanted a Hofner Club bass for over twelve years (when I first laid eyes on one of these sunburst beauties being played by Kurt Smith of Tears for Fears) and I finally got one; even if it is the $350.00 Chinese version rather than the $2300.00 German original. (The bass's manufacture, finish, and workmanship are simply amazingly close to perfection! I'm truly impressed with the workmanship.) However, I really liked the sound of this Club bass with the included round wound strings. Sadly, the winding end of the factory strings were coming unwound somehow and the A string broke at the tuner, necessitating this string purchase. On my other bass I have long used a set of D'Addario ENR71 \"Half Round\" bass strings and love them.  If the Hofner Violin and Club bass users on the bass forums are to be believed, the vast majority of new Hofner bass owners immediately on delivery remove the round wound strings installed in the factory and replace them with LaBella or other brands of flat wound strings.  I guess the idea is to get as close to Paul McCartney's unique thumpy bass sound as possible. I'm different, and am loving the thumpy AND bright overtones, and feel of these D'Addario ENR71M medium scale strings on my new short scale Hofner Club Bass.", "summary": "I LOVE the tone (and feel) of these (ENR71M) half round, medium scale strings on my Hofner Club bass.", "unixReviewTime": 1514332800}

I was fortunate enough to purchase a Danelectro Dan-echo for my first ever delay pedal, way back when I started buying guitar pedals a couple decades ago (thank you random music store salesman). I'm still not sure that anything out there emulates the 60s-era tape echo as well as the Dan-echo. It's lush and warm and perfect in every way. So..  I thought about buying one of those again. But, my combined love of all other MXR pedals (they really do things right most of the time) and having seen so many positive reviews on this pedal, I decided to grab this. I also liked the slimmer design and my pedal board space is nearly maxed out.\n\nI plugged it in and as expected, the tone was beautiful and the more I played with it, the more I liked the sounds I was getting, and then..  I kicked in the distortion. What the heck happened? I started checking all my settings, trying to figure out where I went wrong. No matter what I did, it was horrible sounding. I started researching online and finally realized this simply doesn't work for distortion no matter what you try. It's a \"clean sound\" pedal.\n\nThis has me perplexed as to the number of 5-star reviews and I have to wonder if many people just get this as their first delay pedal and think this is the way it is for all delay pedals?  It's not!  The best part of owning a really good delay pedal is turning it on during a solo after kicking in the distortion. It's about getting that big John Petrucci delay sound - putting air around all the notes and getting a sound that makes you want to stay in your room and play for hours. You will never come close with this pedal.\n\nI emailed my Sweetwater rep with my finding and he replied with the same response.. \"oh yeah, definitely not you want for soloing\". He recommended the Faux Tape Echo v2. I started to decline and go look for the Dan-echo that brought me so much joy years ago but the one thing about the Dan-echo is that plastic pots are used and they break on every one of those pedals ever made. If you play and gig a lot, you can get about a year out of them - 2 if you're lucky. If they would ever replace that with a metal part, they would be gold. The Faux Tape also had one other feature I was really interested in.. tap delay.  Tap your foot to the beat of the song and click it on and you've got a perfectly timed delay every time. I checked out some vids (with distortion) and loved what I heard. I ordered and have never looked back. The Echo is perfect for that sound I was looking for. I'll say it's 95% of the sound the Dan-echo gave me and that's darned good.\n\nSo I'm giving the Carbon Copy 3 stars. MXR makes quality stuff and this pedal is no exception. I also realize that many will simply want/need a \"clean sound\" delay only and for this, I couldn't recommend a pedal anymore. It's beautiful on clean sounds and everything I had hoped.\n\nI hope MXR buys a Dan-echo someday and tries it out for a dirty solo. They'll quickly realize what the Carbon Copy is missing and no doubt, they could create an even better sounding pedal than Danelectro did all those years ago.\n\nSUMMARY: Get the Carbon Copy if you want a great clean sounding delay.

I liked the fact that this model has no robotics tuning feature, just plain Kluson type tuners with the tulip shaped knobs, stamped \"Gibson deluxe\"\n\nThe heritage cherry finish comes in the so called vintage gloss. This is not the smooth, shiny deluxe Gibson finish, nor is it a 'satin' finish. Somewhere in between, and the surface is grained just enough to show the unpolished slab of mahogany tree it began life as. I have seen a lot of SG's made this way and not just the stripped down Specials. The back of the neck is oddly a lighter shade of red than the back of the body. It shows clearly in the Sweetwater photos. Again, many of them seem to have been painted this way for some reason.\n\nI like the crme colored pickup rings and switch plate. I guess the max grip knobs are OK. I am not a guitar snob, so no need to run out and change the knobs back to the classic style right away. Also, I have great expectations of the new cold treated fret wire for hardness and durability. I would much rather replace worn strings than worn frets.\n\nRight out of the box I did some fingering all up and down the neck, picking and chording, unplugged. THAT's when I knew I was right. A non- chambered solid body will carry sounds better than a weight relieved body. It only makes sense. With the SG plugged straight into a Vox 15 watt tuber, I couldn't believe the amazing sounds. I knew that Pete Townshend, Robby Krieger and Angus and Tommy had to be on to something good. Mine has Gibson 490 T and R pickups. They are perfectly balanced in volume and tone. This guitar plays circles around my Les Paul Studio Pro which cost way more. I repeat, the LP's 'modern weight relief' mutes volume and tone on the high end, which is a common complaint, I am learning (the hard way).\n\nThese push pull coil switching volume controls are useless to me, just a gimmick, like self tuning tuners, IMHO.\n\nMy new SG Special is becoming my favorite playing guitar. I also have a Gibson Les Paul Junior Special with humbuckers that I play the hell out of, another non chambered slab of mahogany that sings out loud and clear. The 2014 SG special like mine now costs $350.00 more than the SGJ, for which I got a slightly better paint job (same exact neck, by the way). Next year's model will cost even more (by $200.00) for essentially the same thing. Prices have risen so fast in the last 2 years for Gibsons, and all I want to do is play guitar music.", "summary": "Not so much to look at but, MAN what a sound!", "unixReviewTime": 1417996800}

On the negative side, I would seriously recommend using duck tape for both the four controls and the base of the X2u.

Tape up the controls when you get the standard settings for good wave file recordings without the hiss.\nThe base of the X2u seems to loose connection too often with the cable, thus ruining recordings.  This adapter sound quality is just not that clear. The Mic Monitor function is excellent feature but if you get this, \"use electrical tape or even duck tape\" for the background hissing noise and ideal control settings.

It worked well enough, and had a lot features, like built in effects and drum tracks- but it was way too complicated to use. Every time I took it out it seemed I had to review the manual. Even when when I thought I had the functions all sorted out, it was easy to get confused, with all the menus and sub-menus. I sold it after a few months. Why couldn't they make a cheap multitrack recorder that was as easy to use as the old Tascam cassette-based Portastudios?\n\nEnter the DP-004. While it's not as easy to use as the old cassette units, it's pretty easy- and it does a lot more than any cassette deck ever did. It doesn't have effects or drum tracks (it does have a metronome function) but it does have a lot of knobs and buttons where the Micro BR used menus, and it has two microphones- making it a great portable stereo recorder.\n\nThe DP-004 does have menus, but once you've set the parameters for a session (inputs, track assignments) you can pretty much ignore most of them until it's time for mastering, and even then it's not too complex. Most of the time you can just use the default settings. Live stereo recordings using the built-in microphones can be done with the DP-004 right out of the box: Punch record on tracks 1 and 3, adjust the levels, and hit the RECORD and PLAY buttons. That's it.\n\nI find myself using the stereo recording function even more than the multitrack capability. It's great for recording practice sessions (or school concerts, for you parents) and yet costs about the same as a lot of the two channel recorders.\n\nIt's not perfect. I'd prefer less menu functions and more buttons and switches, but I suppose that would have raised the price and made it larger. Battery life could be better, too, but an AC adapter works well at home. (Hint: Use the Sony PSP100 power supply, which can be had for a fraction of the price of the Tascam unit.)

Edelman", "reviewText": "I have three other acoustic guitars in addition to my new Recording King: a 1970s Guild D35, a 1970s Gibson Gospel, and a Taylor Big Baby. All great guitars, but I wanted something smaller than the Big Baby, for travels, and I was also interested in finding a guitar with less bass, and more of a midrange sound- like the older, small, guitars that this one is trying to copy. I did a lot of on-line research, and a number of people suggested looking for a used Recording King RP-06, a similarly sized guitar but one that has rosewood sides and a slotted headstock, like an old 0-16 or 00-18 Martin. Better sound at not much more money, they said. But I liked the look of the RPH-05, and when I found a used one in \"like new\" condition at Amazon for $140, I grabbed it.\n\nFirst impressions: This is a good looking, solidly built guitar. I read about problems in fit in fit and finish in other reviews, but the one I received is almost- but not quite- free of any flaws. The frets are all finished nicely at the ends, there's no finish overspray, and the neck arrived perfectly adjusted. The binding looks better than what I've seen a lot of more expensive guitars. One problem: The Twelfth fret was just a tad high under the low E, which resulted in a string buzz when fretting Db to Eb. I could have returned it- I suspect this was why my sample was a discounted return- but instead I spent a few minutes with a fret file, and it sounds fine now.\n\nThe neck has an old-school chunky feel to it- not huge, but significantly thicker than a lot of modern flat tops aimed at crossover electric players.  It really deserves a decent case- although a decent hardshell case will cost you almost as much as the guitar ;-) It is a bit heavy, compared to other guitars this size, probably because of the heavy bracing on the back and top.\n\nSound-wise, it's just what I was looking for. It doesn't have the boom of a dreadnaught, or even the deep bass of my Big Baby Taylor. It has a very balanced sound, with the basses and the trebles being equally loud. It records well, and sounds great fingerpicked or strummed. Thanks to the solid top you can strum it pretty hard and still get good tone- a friend who has an old Kalamazoo of a similar size and look thought it compared well. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this as a first guitar for a beginner, despite the low price, unless they were specifically looking for the 1920s-30s sound. But if you are looking for that sound, or if you're looking for a travel guitar with a bigger sound than a Martin Backpacker, this is a great choice.", "summary": "Good sound and a 1920s vibe in a compact package-  at a bargain price", "unixReviewTime": 1425945600}

Maybe it was because I live in the metro New York City area where wireless signals are crowded.  However, I'm quite surprised with this set of microphone in terms of sound quality and connection stability.\n\nIt's five star for the sound quality, but I remove one star for the product design and built quality.  First of all I don't like 9v batteries; they are expensive, not as readily available and not interchangeable with most other devices.  In this day and age where wireless systems using AA batteries are available, I would pay more to avoid 9v systems.\n\nSecondly, the power on off switch is inside the battery compartment, just right under the battery cover.  That means you can't turn it off unless you remove the battery cover.\n\nThirdly, the switch on the outside of the microphone--at the normal position where most microphone switch are located--is just a mute switch.  The problem with that switch is that it is so sunken that you can't easily switch it on and off.  You have to pry it with your nail to move the switch.\n\nSome might deduct several stars for the weaknesses I mentioned above.  However, in most actual usage, the system is managed by a sound professional who will give the microphone to the speaker or vocalist that doesn't need to know how to switch off or mute the microphone.  So in most situations this is not a problem.  In fact some sound managers might prefer that the power switch is hidden, so that it wouldn't be accidentally turned off by the user.\n\nIn general, I would recommend this system for the price, for getting four microphones, and for reasonably good sound.", "summary": "Great Sound with some Minor Weaknesses", "unixReviewTime": 1404086400}

However, in this case, I really don't see what justifies the price on these strings. I gave the Kaplan Amo strings a week of hard playing in hopes that they would improve with age, and then I took them off (they didn't improve). They are formulated similarly to Zyex (also from DAddario), but supposedly are fancier and more expensive. They were indeed very similar to Zyex in some respects, including a similar sound, especially on the A string. However, they were significantly worse than Zyex in several ways, on my fiddle. The Amo strings were much less responsive.  This includes being slow to speak under most circumstances, especially on the D and G strings, and not responsive enough to play quietly (well, you can play quietly on them, but they sound terrible under most reasonable attempts to do this). In contrast, Zyex strings on my fiddle have had incredibly fast response, and a decent dynamic range.  Also, even more concerning, the Kaplan Amos that I tried had very weak D and G strings. They totally lacked any kind of power. In contrast, the Zyex strings I've tried in the past have had an awesome boom and growl on the low end when you want it, and smooth velvety power when you want it. In short: If you haven't tried Zyex yet (the *new* formulation of Zyex strings from the past few years), try them before Kaplan Amo - you may save a lot of money in the long run for a better overall experience.\n\nI'd also like to mention the advertising point they make that Kaplan Amos are supposed to be warm, to compliment a bright fiddle. I did not find that to be so. They actually seemed a little on the bright side. I've used Obligatos and Larsen Tzigane strings for powerful warmth on this fiddle, and they worked fabulously. Kaplan Amo did not.  But, of course, your milage may vary.

I play electric guitar, and have a pedalboard with stereo output. I run the left channel to one amp, and the right channel to another amp, and play in stereo. The problem I was having was that if I had both amps connected, they both had a buzz. If I disconnected the cable from the amp input of one amp, the buzz would stop from the other amp. This is how I knew it was a ground loop issue.\n\nI did some research, found this Hum X, and decided to try it. Got it, plugged it in, and Presto! my hum problem was fixed. So I can say this definitely worked for me. If you have a dual amp setup, and there is no hum/buzz when one amp is plugged into your pedalboard, but there is hum/buzz once you attach the 2nd amp to the pedalboard, then you probably have the same issue I did, and this filter should fix it.\n\nThe thing I really like about this filter is that it removes hum at the amp's power cable. There are other ways to get rid of hum, such as using an isolation transformer (or some kind of direct box) between the pedalboard and the amp, but that can introduce its own noise. The Hum X fixes ground loop hum without inserting anything into the signal path, which is awesome.\n\nThe only down side to this is that it is a very simple electronic device with a huge markup. You're paying $$$ for probably $2 worth of parts. Somebody is making a huge profit off this invention. As far as I know, there are no competing devices that do quite the same thing, maybe because it would be patent infringement or something. But hey, expensive or not, it works. So I'm happy with it.", "summary": "Fixed the hum in my dual amp setup", "unixReviewTime": 1493337600}

I have provided a customer-supplied image at the top of this page to illustrate what I mean.\n\nThese sleeves positively prevent keyholes and the twenty-four in this pack will outfit most drum kits plus provide spares for those inevitable times when you lose one during teardown after a long gig.\n\nThe tubing is relatively thick-walled and pliable. The length is perfect for folks like myself who do not use top felts. Most importantly, though, is that they fit both 6mm and 8mm screw posts on vintage and modern stands.  Think of this as a very inexpensive way to protect a large investment in cymbals. I guarantee that a cymbal mounted without a sleeve is going to keyhole (or worse) in a relatively short time.

Right smack dab in the middle of moving I needed to upgrade the case for my Les Paul Standard Plustop PRO from my current gig bag. I knew when I got the gig bag it is what it is - a cheap, kinda-sorta-maybe protected carrying solution. This case is the real deal.\n\nIt should not be a surprise that it fits like a glove, which is what I expected from a case made by the guitar manufacturer. This should not be understated- this will fit your Epi Les Paul like it is nobody's business. The lining is fairly lush and well-padded and the hinge top storage section is of ample size and construction.\n\nThe clasps function well and open and closes with ease. While in the closed position, your gear is safely stowed and will survive transport without breaking a sweat.\n\nThe covering is quite good for a ~$100 guitar case and the handle placement balances well when being carried. (I have heard some mention they are not crazy with the case sporting a huge Epiphone logo, but I personally think that is ridiculous. For me, if you are that brand obsessed, then go fork out the cash for a Gibson, but as for me, I don't mind \"representing\" Epiphone as I really love this guitar. Get over yourself.)\n\nGreat bang for the buck and your Les Paul deserves this case.

According to AKG parts lists, the 271 and 240 models use the same superb XXL drivers.  In addition the 271 has an automatic cut out switch that mutes the phones if you take them off.  This feature is vital in studio use but is somewhat annoying for home use.  Like the 240,  two sets of ear cushions and two cords are included.  Cords for the 240 and 271 are interchangeble.\n\nI used no equalizer or tone controls in this listening test.\n\nAfter a 20 hour break-in, sound is very similar to the 240 studio version, as would be expected.  Balance is very natural, like live music, rather than punchy or  unnaturally bright.  Bass seems more tight and the lowest notes seem more defined than with the  K 240 studio phones. Female vocals sound very natural with both model phones, Male vocals sometimes sound a bit thin, especially operatic basses with the K 271 phones.  The K 240 phones really shine with bass voices and choral music.  Orchestral sound can be thin with the 271, especially when historic instrument recordings are played,  On the otherhand, the K 271 studio is superb at cleaning up bass heavy orchestral sound.  Having both reduces my desire to buy an equalizer, as most recordings sound ideal on one phone or the other.  At this point you may want to read my K240 reviews if you are not familiar with the K 240 phones. UPDATE AUG 2012: I am just starting to test Beyerdynamic  DT 770 PRO phones (80 Ohm) which are more expensive.  The DT 770 Has a cleaner midrange than either AKG 240 or 271, but is not as clean above 13 kHz. The DT 770 came from a person who is younger than I am, who now likes the AKG 240 studio better.  For an older listener, like me, the DT 770 PRO may be a better choice.  As my high frequency hearing declined I became more critical of midrange sound. Older recordings benefit the most from the DT 770 PRO phones, however many audiophile grade recordings sound better too, if I listen very critically.  My father had the same experience of becoming more midrange critical with age. Sound isolation is the same as the AKG 271.\n\nHere is the science behind what I perceive,  the Headroom website allows one to compare headphone test data.  The AKG 240 has a smooth rolloff from 13 kHz to 20 kHz while the the DT 770 PRO dip and then peak, in this frequency range.  Harmonic distortion peaks at minus 50 decibels in the AKG 240 which is sometimes heard.  On the otherhand, the DT 770 PRO harmonic peak is down minus 70 decibels.  This is so low that any harmonic distortion products are masked by the slight background noise that is part of any recording.\n\nConclusion:  If your hearing above 12 kHz is weak,  the Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO (80 ohms) is the best choice sonically due to it's super clean midrange and strong but accurate bass. You get the full sound of the AKG 240 with the isolation of the AKG 271.  Unlike AKG however, Beyer offers no diagrams or parts, not good if you do your own repairs.  If you damage the cord you may have to open the ear cup with no knowledge of what is inside. No spare ear cushions or cord is included.", "summary": "CLOSED VERSION OF AKG K 240  MK II  STUDIO HEADPHONE", "unixReviewTime": 1277942400}

Well put together.\n- Factory setup was pretty good. Better than the factory setup on some Gibsons, though I am not trying to imply that the quality of the instrument is in that ball park. It's not.\n- The parts that are important for sound are good... The nut is cut well. The bridge and saddles are substantial.\n- Soldering and wiring is well done, albeit with cheap parts.\n\nCons:\n- Tuners are difficult to use... Particularly for new players that this instrument targets. A half turn seems to adjust pitch by about... Whoa... Just measured it. 1/2 turn of the E string tuner dropped it 2 whole steps. Not a subtle change.\n- The quality of wood and workmanship on the neck prevents a really great setup. It can be made good, but not fabulous without way more effort than the instrument is worth.\n- Lol at the knobs. Actually, I don't think people would notice the cheap knobs if the potentiometers behind them had more friction. The combination of fake-chrome plastic and very low resistance to turning creates a very cheap feel.\n\nIn short, this is a great instrument to learn on. Except for a bit of a hurdle with the tuning, learners should not be frustrated by this bass. I would love it if Ibanez would turn out a pro or semi-pro model in this size. But outside of that, it is hard to find something better. In fact, one path to getting a semi-pro bass in this size without the cost of a custom build seems to be examining several of these until you find one of these with a great neck. Then replacing pickups, wiring, tuners, and possibly the nut.", "summary": "Considering the Price, it's Solid", "unixReviewTime": 1395273600}

I thought about dinging it one star just because they are a tad underpowered with 10W per speaker (20 total) but they have enough headroom for their size as pc speakers or digital mixer speakers that I did not.  SELDOM do I ever need 20W at my mixing workstation but it's nice to have headroom, which these do have.  It's just that they want so much more money (1.5x) for the 40W total / 20W per channel version of the same speaker.  They should drop the 10Wpch and just make the 20Wpch which would be an excellent product.  Still, getting this ability for less than a benjamin is a great pricepoint.\n\nThe advantages are that these work well with all digital systems - I am moving to all digital workflow now and these speakers take optical or coax directly to the speaker, which is a great benefit.  On the coax digital you can use a video distribution amplifier to make multiple coppies of a coax digital signal to feed several devices from one digital source.\n\nI use 24 bit / 96 khz most of the time but the speakers are rated to 24 bit/ 192 khz and autorange the digital input, so things just work no matter what you are sending to the speakers.\n\nIf you are not all digital yet, they feature a full compliment of analog inputs so you can buy these today for your analog mixer and when you move to digital your speakers won't need to change.\n\nFor flexibility - 5 stars\nFor value - 5 stars\nFor audio output only - 4 stars\nFor ease of connectivity - 5 stars\n\nIn summary - its a 5 star product at 99 bucks\n\nIn all honesty you don't need more than 10 watts at a mixing board - save the kilowatt amps for the house speaker systems - hopefully someday we will run optical cable to our house amplified speakers and connect them digitally from the mixer.\n\nI would recommend you measure the power in watts you use at your workstation today and decide on the 20W total or 40w total version of this when going all digital.

(I actually bought three of them.)\n\nI crank the gas heat up in the house in the winter and A/C in the summer, keep my guitars inside their cases and inside a closet. The humidity drops quite low, but the sponges remain moist for several days before I can no longer fight the urge to re-wet them. lol.\n\nTwo great tips in one:\nUse a regular, more dense sponge, thicker like the ones at the dollar store. Cut them to size and stuff them in!\nThrow away the sponge when it starts to get yucky and don't worry about distilled water, unless you want to. I can't argue using very pure water compared to the possibly toxic crap that comes out our faucets, but for one dollar you can get a boat load of them after you cut them to size, and toss them away without any regard when needing replaced.\n\nDon't worry about the \"thing\" hanging in-between your strings. It will not damage anything unless you get the sponge  too saturated and it leaks. I will either squeeze the excess water out, or shake the container with the sponge inside until I am satisfied that it won't drip.\n\nThe humidifier will not cause any stress or damage to your strings by spreading them when you wedge this inside your soundhole.\n\nIf you ARE rough, careless, thoughtless, or stupid, you could possibly knock this loose and have it rub or fall out, but I would be more worried about the guitar and what it would take for this to happen. This would be more extreme to the guitar than the humidifier or any harm it could cause.\n\nThe top snaps on by squeezing the sides to release little tabs that stick through the top cover. The sponge inside is quite small, and there isn't too much room for a much larger sponge. The device is simple and fairly solid. Treat it gently and it will last forever. You can easily clean the inside or run it through a dishwasher. If you give the inside a quick rinse every few fills, I'm sure it would be a decade before anything \"built up\" to require extensive cleaning or replacement.\n\nKeep an eye on it for the first few days and then weeks to get a feel for when you should be re-wetting the sponge.\nTry to keep the sponge moist when it's dry.\n\nI strongly suggest getting an Oasis case humidifier, (or similar) mini sized about 1\" X 4\" costing around 17-20 bucks.\nThis will take any guesswork out of the equation and give you fairly accurate readings inside your guitar or instrument case.\n\nRemember, too much humidity can cause your acoustic guitar to warp. Too dry and it will shrink and crack, split the soundboard (top) also leaving the edges of the frets sticking out like the backbone of a fish and quite abrasive!\n\nIf you spent more than one hundred dollars on your guitar and live where it gets cold and/or dry, you would be negligent (if not careless) to spend the pittance to make sure your 'baby ain't thirsty', or worse...dead & broken!\n\nHope this helps!", "summary": "Works Fine & Much Better Than Nothing!", "unixReviewTime": 1390262400}

The price is a bit outrageous, in that case.  If it is made in the USA, I apologize; in that case, the price seems fair, but it is, unfortunately, not very accurate.\n\nI have used these (this is my second one) for years now, along with Oasis humidifiers (separate topic, but I have switched to the Humitar now when my Oases die).  I have always assumed they were accurate.  They are not.\n\nAre they accurate enough to keep in your guitar case?  Yeah, probably.  Once the humidity gets below 30%, they tend to just read \"--%\".  This is fine, because if the humidity is below 30%, your guitars should be in their cases with humidifiers (or you should be humidifying the house/room).  However, I tended to assume this meant my house had no humidity in it, and I would panic.  That's not the case.  Additionally, they consistently read the humidity lower than it actually is, at least in the 30s and below (above that, I'm not sure yet--maybe it is accurate higher-up, or maybe it is always inaccurate).  I've attached a photo to demonstrate how it always says the temperature is higher than it is, and how it frequently reads the humidity as lower than it is.\n\nI now have a more accurate hygrometer, an Acurite, which sells on Amazon for a fraction of this (and is also a cheap Chinese import, probably ruining the planet and the lives of the people making them, but at least it is priced to reflect that and is high quality).  This one accurately shows when the house is at, say, 16%, or 22% humidity.  I've found that, even in the dry winter months where my forced-air is blasting the house dry as a bone and I can't introduce humidity into the house for fear of mold, the ambient humidity is still 20-30%.  This is comforting.  Yes, it's too dry for guitars, but it's fine for them to be out for a few hours, fine for my electric to sit out, and it is much easier to maintain in-case humidity of 40-50% when you know outside the case is 20-30%, not 0%!  People have tested the Acurite and verified that it is accurate.\n\nSimilarly, a good hygrometer will tell you, during the summer with your windows open (or a/c running--yuck) when your humidity is 15-40%.  The Oasis, on the other hand, will simply stop giving you a reading when it gets much below 40%, or it will just give you a lower reading than reality.  Useless.  When it comes to guitars, there is a big difference between humidity of 29% and 36%, yet it is reading 29% at the moment (quite dry) when in reality it is 36% (too dry but not dangerously so).\n\nSo, for $30, you are kind of getting duped.  It is accurate enough (though still a few % off) in the 40% and above, but wouldn't you rather have something more accurate?", "summary": "Overpriced and not necessarily accurate--sometimes won't show a reading at all.", "unixReviewTime": 1483747200}

But, this technology seems to be the direction of wireless sound systems.  The only down-side I've seen so far is excessive battery consumption.  Sound reproduction is excellent.  So, four stars for incredible sound reproduction.  Minus one star for battery consumption.  Read on.\n\nI bought two of these from a local source to replace a couple UHF wireless mics which operated in a frequency range that was re-dedicated to public service entities by FCC in about 2010, i.e. 698 to 806 MHz wireless microphones are now illegal to use in US & Canada. (Mexico might also have adopted the same protocol).  The ATW-1102's are UHF mics (300MHz to 3 GHz) and operate at 2.4 GHz.  (That's over-simplifying everything).\n\nWireless mics require batteries.  And, most wireless mics do not have a battery meter to tell you when your power source is about to die.. So, you'll find yourself replacing good batteries 'just to be safe' and to make sure the thing doesn't die mid-sentence or mid-song.  The 1102's are no different in this regard.  There is no battery meter on these; they have a blinking green light that indicates low battery....and you have to be looking directly at the microphone to see the green light flashing on and off.  There's no indicator on the receiver.\n\nI've found that mics which require 9v batteries operate longer and are more reliable.  (arguable).  Those which require AA's and AAA's usually require more frequent battery replacement.  The ATW-1102 owners manual suggests that two AA batteries should be good for 7 hours \"depending on usage pattern\".  My experience is that you 'might' get 3 hours with the 1102 mic continuously on and actually used for 45 minutes of that time speaking normally into the mic at 50-62 db.\n\nThey're simple to set up, easy to adjust and are engineered in such a way as to virtually eliminate feedback by manipulating on board gain adjustment.  I could stand maybe four feet in front of a speaker with a hot mic and not be afraid of feedback.\n\nWere it not for the battery consumption issue, which I don't think is all THAT inconsistent with other wireless mics which require AA or AAA batteries, these things would be perfect.  Battery consumption is what it is:  there's better and much worse out there.  But, for the current price of these units, battery consumption might be a deal breaker.  Had I known beforehand that they'd suck this much juice, I might've considered other manufacturers.  But AudioTechnica quality is hard to beat.  The reason I bought these is because I also had some ATW-700's.  Excellent quality stuff!\n\nAt this writing there is a rebate of $25 if you buy two of the System 10 ATW-1102's.  It seems also that they can be purchased cheaper locally than on Amazon.  That certainly will change as the price will certainly have to come down.\n\nAnd, that's my first impression.

The body fits really good against the abdomen and just feels good.  The whole guitar just feels \"right\" when I hold it.\nI wanted a guitar that could do alot of different styles of music.  It didn't have to be the best at anything just passably decent.  I looked at the ec-50 b/c I live in a rural area and this was all my local music shop had to offer IN MY PRICE RANGE (stressed b/c if you got the cash then obviously get something better).  I plugged this into a marshall 15w basic amp and it sounded awesome, even on clean.  I recommend this to anyone who is a beginner-intermediate, especially because of how fast you can finger the fretboard.\n\nNote: It doesn't matter really what reviewers say about guitars (especially electric).

Jackson", "reviewText": "I used this as an upgrade to the astonishingly cheap and poorly made plastic nut on a Squier Affinity telecaster. The spacing is a bit wide for the Affinity because it uses a 40.8mm width, and this is spaced at the Fender import width of 42mm. Consequently there was .6 mm hanging off of each side. Additionally the Squier nut breadth is 3.25mm and import standard is 3.5mm. It needed to be thinned, which took about 20 minutes of careful sanding on 320 grit sandpaper. Shaping the shoulders took a bit more time, but was doable with a thin file. The result though was more than satisfactory. Fender takes regular neck blanks for Squier and Fender and simply carves a little deeper between the first fret and the nut for these Squier guitars so as to make retrofitting Fender parts more difficult, and thus make counterfeiting more difficult/impossible. But relevant in this case just resulted in the strings being a little closer to the edges of the neck than is conventional due to the string spacing on this nut. It also made it a little more comfortable to play on the neck because the strings weren't as cramped at the 1st-3rd frets.\n\nAnyway, as to the material of the nut, it sanded like bone. Plastic leaves behind a differently textured grit than bone, and if this wasn't bone it was an amazing counterfeit. Corian perhaps? It looks like bone and plays like bone and works like bone, and has a similar weight and density to bone, and was good enough for what I got it for. If you want to be fussier than that you may want to consider paying more than six dollars for the privilege.\n\nSo yes in conclusion measure your existing nut to see if it's American 43 mm width or import 42 mm width. Verify whether your nut slot is flat or radiused.

I can achieve a wide dynamic range with it. Note: I play heel down and do not use any bass drum muffling beyond a felt strip behind my bass drum heads. I mention those facts because if your playing technique or set-up may lead to a different opinion of this beater.\n\nAs I mentioned, I do use other beaters sometimes, so have some basis of comparison for the feel of different beaters on the same pedal. The heavy top of this beater gives a certain momentum when you are playing fast. I am sure it has to do with the center of gravity and weight, but am only guessing. The beater itself is densely packed, so you can get near the same effect as you can from a wooden beater head. But because it is felt, you can get softer notes if you feather it.\n\nWith a non- or minimally-muffled bass drum you can easily coax old school sounds with this beater - something you will be hard pressed to do with some of the modern beaters with light heads and multiple faces.

I wasn't planning on taking up the fiddle at the time I purchased this, so I just needed something inexpensive to demonstrate what he should be doing, or sound like. I had played violin, and cello as a child, and I also play guitar, and a little piano, so I am a bit of a help to him getting through his fiddle homework from his teacher.\nI really wasn't expecting too much from this fiddle, and that is partly why I gave it three stars instead of two. I had researched many instruments under $200.00 and decided on this one, because it had real ebony fingerboard, and pegs, not painted black wood. Also I liked the fact that it had inlaid purling. The extra items that came along with the instrument other than the case, were of no real importance to me because I knew I would need to upgrade the bow, and strings. And good rosin is pretty cheap ( around $10.00).\n\nThe good: The fiddle came set up with strings and bridge. If you are a new player, it is intimidating to to string and set up the bridge on your instrument.\nThe fiddle did in infact have ebony fingerboard and fittings. Right out of the box, It was playable, but the sound wasn't very good.  I could have left it as is, for a teaching aid I suppose, but I wanted to get the best possible sound out of it.\n\nThe bad: The fiddle had a terrible smell out of the box, I suspect it was the varnish that was used. I could live with it, but someone sensitive to smells might have a hard time. The strings that come on the fiddle, and the extra set are really terrible. Tinny, and buzzy. I had already planned on upgrading the strings. I actually purchased a set of D'Addario Helicores at the same time I purchased the fiddle. Replacing the strings is a must if you want to be able to play without being frustrated by the scratchy sound these produce. The fine tuners were impossible. They simply weren't big enough to get the ball end of the strings through. They didn't look like the fine tuners I had been used to, so I took them to our fiddle teacher, and asked her to help me. She couldn't get them to work either. She said I would need to put a new tailpiece on.\nI took it to a local luthier, and had them replace the tail piece that came with it, with a whitney style tail piece with fine tuners. The luthier advised me not to spend anymore money on this fiddle, as it was just not worth it.  I wasn't planning on it anyway, and I knew it was a really cheap poorly made instrument, so his response didn't shock me. The bows that came with the fiddle starting falling apart right away. The hair was constantly snagging on things, and getting ripped out. I decided to upgrade the bow to a carbon fiber bow, and was much happier with the results from that bow. The varnish on the back of the fiddle, comes to a really abrupt stop on the neck. The neck should NOT be varnished.( I saw some reviewers complaining that the neck had no varnish. This is how it should be. The varnish will mix with the oil from your hands, and become sticky, making sliding up the the neck really hard) This fiddle has a clear line of demarkation where the varnish stops. I noticed on my son's much more expensive fiddle, it is a really gradual fade that is hardly noticeable. Also, the neck on my son's fiddle, although varnish free, has been sanded to a really smooth glossy feel. This fiddle feels like it was given a preliminary sand with a rough grit, and then never finished. The action is very high ( the distance from the string to the fingerboard, higher action means you have to press harder to get a good clear tone from the string) this could be fixed by having it re-set up by a luthier, but I really wouldn't waste the money on this instrument. The case is really cheap as I expected, the inside pieces started coming unglued within a few months. Although I didn't buy it for the extra items included, the shoulder rest is also very cheap, it falls off a lot, and I replaced that as well. The rosin is ok. It works. I didn't receive the tuner with my purchase.\n\nThe verdict: This is an extremely entry level instrument. For the price, you can upgrade the bow, the strings, and tail piece, and end up with a violin that will last through your first year or two of lessons and is still pretty inexpensive. It is in no way professional level, as stated in the description. It was playable though. I bought a cello online many years ago, and what I received was a cello shaped object. Completely unplayable in every way. This fiddle served its purpose as a teaching aid for me. And I have decided to start lessons myself. I just upgraded to a french trade violin from circa 1890-1913 the difference is remarkable in tone, action, and response. In general if you are looking to get this for yourself or your child who wants to take lessons, I would say you are better off renting from a quality violin store. The ones in my area rent good quality violins for under $30.00 a month. Rent until you are sure this is something you want to do (i'd say at least a year) then shop around locally for an instrument you can try out. Or  use an online violin store that offers in home trials. If you are looking for a throw away instrument like I was this will get the job done for you.", "summary": "Playable after a few upgrades.", "unixReviewTime": 1378771200}

I was looking for a replacement for my trusty and faithful Tascam DR-1, and this expensive critter is not it. I play in a band and we routinely record our shows, so I set-and-forget my digital audio recorder for four hours at a time.\n\nIn all of my uses thus far, I have yet to achieve a satisfactory recording. The DR-70D just doesn't produce a clear and precise digital recording worthy of mixing down and sharing. Lately, I have used both my DR1 and DR-70D to be certain I get at least one good recording, and I toss the latter's huge digital file away. The DR-1 still does the trick--and with its built-in mics, no less.\n\nI don't understand the reason for the underlying shortcomings in the DR-70D. I've used both the built in mics and a top-line outboard Rode NH4 stereo condenser with no discernible difference in sound--which is best described as \"middy,\" ie, with little bottom and high end frequencies. I would expect a digital recorder to offer a pure, unadulterated sound.\n\nAlso, I was distressed to learn that all of my pre-sets would be lost when I change the batteries in the unit unless I plug it in to my computer while swapping. So I have to jigger the whole contraption around as I switch batteries. On the contrary, the DR-1 has a rechargeable Li-Ion battery that has held up for 7 or 8 years. Also the DR-1 is smaller and lighter, and has more adjustable settings for sound files. In fact, I have the DR-1 set to produce a simple MP3 output. Four hours of recording is about 360 MB. The DR1 is limited in its output choices, and the WAV file it produces is two or three gigabytes.\n\nSorry, but I'm 100% displeased with this product and likely won't be using it in the future.", "summary": "This Is Not The Digital Recorder You've Been Hoping For", "unixReviewTime": 1460937600}

Walczak", "reviewText": "Alrighty, let me begin this by saying that as a musician who's been playing both live and in the studio for over 30 years now and as something of a multi-instrumentalist (I play guitar, bass, drums, a bit of fiddle, some keys and pretty much anything else I can get my hands on)...let's just say I've seen A LOT of tuners in my day.  From Radio Shark and Banana's to tuning forks to high end Sabine rack tuners and Peterson Strobe's...yea, I suspect I've pretty much seen/used them all.  With that in mind, if I could have only -1- tuner in my gig bag, REGARDLESS of price, it would be a Snark!\n\nThese little buggers are really amazing to say the least....very easy to use and dead nuts accurate...and they're reasonably affordable to boot!  While I mainly use the Snark for guitar and bass, I have gone so far as to use my SN2 to tune my Autoharp as well...did an outstanding job to say the least.  Because of the amazing accuracy, I've also switched to the Snark for doing guitar setups...as a person who currently owns around 30 guitars, I do A LOT of string changes and setups and these little Snarks are fantastic for setting intonation and such.  For those unfamiliar with this item, it's a \"clip on\" instrument tuner (I can't remember which Snark is which at the moment but be aware that some models are chromatic, some are not).  In the case of a guitar for example, you clip this tuner to the instrument somewhere (typically the head stock) and it picks up the instrument's vibrations.  The color LED dial is very easy to read (except perhaps in really bright sunlight) and the head even swivels so you can keep an eye on your tuning as you're playing.\n\nSince I've seen a negative comment about this, I feel I should say a word or two about \"quality\".  First and foremost, this unit is rather small and it's made of plastic...ok?  It's designed to be exceptionally light weight and easy to use.  It's NOT a stomp box and you're likely to break it if you abuse it in any way.  In my own personal (albeit experienced) opinion, this is NOT a design flaw.  It never ceases to amaze me how many people will be abusive with their toys, then not understand why the toy breaks.  These units should be thought of as precision tuners and for what they are and what they do, the quality is excellent. The head is flexible enough that you should be able to move it to where you need it, the clip holds the tuner to the instrument securely and the soft padding on the clip prevents damage to the instrument.  With that in mind however, obviously the Snark isn't for everyone.  If you truly need something more \"rugged\" for things like stage antics or perhaps for younger students or you're the kind of person who haphazardly shoves everything into one bag after a gig, etc., a pedal like the Boss TU-3 may be more to your liking.  Again, the Snark is small and it's made of plastic - some degree of common sense is advised.\n\nNow that said, I've been using my Snarks for nearly 2 years now...I thought the first one was incredible and as it quickly became an essential piece of gear, I immediately bought a second (I typically have at least two guitars on stage for an average gig so having a second Snark made sense).  In fact my bass player was so amazed with my Snark that after having just received a Korg tuner for his birthday, he went out and bought a Snark the same week!  Except for having to change the battery occasionally (a fairly common CR 2032), I have had no problem at all with these tuners.  My SN2 stays on my favorite Strat about 99% of the time...I use 2 rectangular hardshell cases to transport my axes to and from gigs and they both have plenty of space to leave the Snark attached to the headstock without damage to tuner or guitar.. if you're trying to slide a gig bag over the instrument or you have a tightly molded case however, you'll want to remove the Snark first as you'll likely break it.\n\nWhile I use my Snark(s) for everything from setups to practice, I think where these tuners really shine is at gigs.  Unlike a pedal tuner, which adds just one more thing to the signal chain and another chunk of metal to the already weighty gig bag, by clipping this small, light weight tuner to the instrument itself, I find the Snark to be wonderfully practical.  Unlike other clip on tuners, the Snark is VERY easy to read...the dial reminds me of a high end, digital tachometer on a car and it makes those quick tuning checks between songs much easier and a lot faster (particularly after a song which may include some heavy trem use on the Strats)!  I just roll the volume on the guitar back and with the Snark, I can give things a quick once over.  For that matter, I have to say that because it's right there on the headstock of the instrument, I find this tuner much easier to read than most pedals I've used as well....it's easier to see and I don't have to be standing right over the pedal to see it.  With the extended number of segments on the scale, (compared with only 8 or 10 on many clip and pedal tuners), again i find the Snark to be incredibly accurate.  With both myself and the bass player using Snarks and our front man using the tuner on his Helicon, the band actually stays in tune thru each and every set!  As they say, Tun-ing is NOT just a city in China :-)\n\nOne last thing I would like to add here is regarding the different models of Snark.  If you need a chromatic tuner, then the SN2 here is difficult to beat...it is however, also a bit more expensive.  In various brick and mortar stores (ala Guitar Center and Sam Ash, etc), I've seen the SN2 going for over $30.  Still a bargain compared with other tuners, HOWEVER...if you're just a guitar player and don't really use alternate tunings and such at all and/or you don't have a specific need for a chromatic tuner, a Snark SN5 can save you a couple of bucks.  Works just as well as other models when there isn't a need for chromatic tuning..  Having a tuner with this ability is nice, but if you don't really need it...why pay extra for it?  My first Snark was the SN2 listed here...the second was the SN5 and on both my electrics and acoustics, as well as on my basses, both are equally effective.\n\nThe final word - along with a guitar, amp and a decent cable or two, the Snark has become one of my most vital pieces of equipment.

I found the Micro Crush and Micro Cube to be way too loud given their intended use.  I wanted a amp I could play quietly, not at whisper volumes, but quiet enough so as not to disturb other house occupants.\n\nBlackstar nailed it here!  For being a little plastic battery powered amp, this little guy can produce awesome tone, clean or overdriven, at my target volumes!  Truthfully, I think this amp is an excellent investment to literally guitarists at all skill levels.  Experienced players would at the very least find this amp's tones satisfying, and it's extremely portable.  Beginners would be able to start with an amp that can be played at reasonable volumes, isn't too simple or too complex to experiment with dialing in tones, and sorry if I sound arrogant, but I think this amp sounds leagues better than any of the amps you see packaged in electric guitar starter sets.\n\nThis amp sounds so good, a fellow guitarist actually mistook this amp's tones for my Blackstar HT5-R's tones once!

My theory is that lightly finished wood can \"rebound\" from light knocks and bumps while enameled/nitroed/painted wood surfaces will dent or scratch.\n  My LPJ plays and sounds great (most of the reviews agree on this point) and while it may not be as pretty as some guitars it's more beautiful than most of them!", "summary": "A BEAUTY", "unixReviewTime": 1402876800}
