I'm a heavy user that's your normal talk, text and Facebook/netflix/music with some games thrown in the mix. I've owned many different types of phones (I like seeing the new features different manufacturers come out with) and decided why not take a 100 buck plunge into checking out Blu phones, seen their specs and prices and was curious. Comes with a case and screen protector, and both fit perfect. The phone itself has a nice feel to it (my buddy has an s6 and was checking out my Blu phone and commented on how he liked the way it felt) and has the right weight and build to make it feel solid. I love the battery life on it. I work 10 hour shifts, have 2 hours of commute time and still have plenty of battery left when I get home. I knew what the specs were before I got it and have owned flagship phones in past (along with some lower and midrange) so I knew what to expect wasn't anything near those that cost me 5xs or more. But saying that this little hundred dollar phone surprised me. Screen is nice but it doesn't have a true automatically adjusting screen. You set its brightness and then it varies it slightly from there (which can be disabled easily). Good in a way because some phones screens are set too high/low on the presets. BUT with that being said, a few times I adjusted it a little too low with the option turned on and it made screen go blank, it was on but unreadable. First time I had to factory reset phone, second I happened to pull down the settings bar and touched in right area to adjust screen back up. Blu released an update a week after contacting them and haven't had an issue again. There is a little delay at times with the phone, but honestly what 100 dollar phone out doesn't. I get great 4g signal on cricket (att towers) and phone was easy to set up, that is once I realized the settings that automatically are installed on phone for cricket was wrong (actually aiowireless.net instead of cricketwireless.net). I stream Netflix no problem even with a couple apps open in back. 8 gigs isn't a lot but lollipop let's you move to SD again, the 1 gig ram is actually holding its own better than I thought (probably because it's almost pure stock Android). It can be rooted, haven't found a permanent one yet but I just run the root program if I ever have to reboot phone (which is rare).  Pictures turn out pretty good, have taken some great ones with the camera. The only issue I've ran into with the phone besides lack of cases  and screen protectors available is the headphone  jack. If I don't use the supplied headphones (whether it is aux cable, stereo headset, mic headset) the music plays out of speaker on phone (and speaker gets loud) while playing thru the headset. I almost sent it back but really didn't affect my using phone 99% of time as I use Bluetooth everywhere from home to car to work and only found out on accident so I kept it and happy I did. To some may be a deal breaker because the headset supplied is fragile feeling, but my set has survived a good bit of use and I'm hard on wired devices. I would definitely recommend this device to someone who doesn't need lte (4g streams everything I want) and wants a good unlocked phone.

It made me always question why people spend over $600 on phones when a $200 could work just as well. With the new Moto G, I was willing to buy it right on the spot. But what turned me off was the nearly 3 weeks Id have to wait for one to be delivered. So I started my search for the next best phone under $200, which lead me to this phone. Ive had some experience with Alcatel phones, so I didn't have much expectations with this phone. That being said, Ive had a couple of days with it and I can say with absolute confidence that I love it.\n\n-Design-\n\nThis is one light phone. Im starting with that because you have no idea how light it is until you hold it in your hand. I actually thought for a moment that the battery wasn't inside it yet. But it is pleasant to hold in the hand. The design is all plastic, so don't expect anything premium on this phone like metal. But it is solidly built, rivaling even the Galaxy S5 in build quality. Speaking of which, this phone is lighter and slimmer than the S5. If the phone were sold for more money, Id still be satisfied. Its not just good build quality for the price. Its excellent build quality. Period. The chrome accent is a nice touch and the speaker grills are slightly angled towards the phone, which add a bit of sparkle to an otherwise black phone. No soft touch plastic on this phone, but it does land on a middle ground where the plastic is nice to touch and is resistant to fingerprints. The design is completely symmetrical, which is important for a certain feature that is unique to it. Id love it even more if it were available in a different color such as white, but that is personal preference. Overall, I cant find much to complain; especially for the low $180 price.\n\n-Performance-\nIf you have seen the Moto Gs specs, you're pretty much getting the same hardware. It uses a Snapdragon 410, 720p display, microSD expansion, Android Lollipop, and even the same camera module (Sony IMX 214). However, there are a few key difference that make this a better phone than the Moto G. For instance, this phone has 1.5 GB of RAM (Moto G=1GB), actual front facing stereo speakers, a 4.7 compared to the 5, NFC, and 16GB of storage(Moto G=1GB). In benchmarks, I have gotten similar results to the Moto G in both CPU and graphic performance. But benchmarks are only one side of the performance experience. The other is daily user experience. Based on the couple of days with it and after installing many apps, I can tell you that this phone is snappy. Its not as fast as the current flagship lineup, but it never lags or clips the graphics. Apps open relatively quickly and the animations are smooth, as well as the transitions from one app to another. In my testing of multitasking ability, it opened Chrome, Angry Birds, Pokemon Puzzle, and YouTube with no lag and each app open where I left them off. Opening more will force the phone to suspend one of those apps to save RAM, but 4 apps at once without closing is pretty good for the cost. Games also perform good, as long as you have reasonable expectations. 2D games such as Angry Birds, Pokemon Puzzle, and Clash of Clans run smoothly and without an issue. Other games like Asphalt 8 and Real Racing 3 will run smooth, but not at the highest quality setting. But thats to be expected from a midrange phone. Signal quality is good. I was able to get 62 Mbps download speed and 8 Mbps upload on T-Mobiles 4G LTE around Pasadena, CA. Thanks to band 12 support, cell signal in buildings is good with the signal almost never going under 3 bars. The speakers are also amazingly good and loud, coming close to matching HTCs Boomsound phone speakers thanks to the help from JBL. Overall, it performs close to flagship specs, albeit a bit slower. Most people should be happy with this phone.\n\n-Display-\n\nThe phone itself has a beautiful HD display with a 312 PPI (note that the iPhone 6 has a 324 PPI) and it is advertise as being calibrated by Technicolor. While they aren't at the S6s quality display, it does come close. The display has a nice color calibration, with vivid colors and nice blacks and whites. It is also bright enough for using even in direct sunlight and the good contrast means you can clearly see what you are doing. It isn't perfect since there are a couple of issues. The colors do have a VERY slight cool tone, meaning that the whites do have a TINY bit of blue to them. Another small issue is that there is a slight amount of light bleed on one side of the displace. But it isn't noticeable in daily use and it is good for the price of the phone. One crucial one is the fact that they aren't using Gorilla glass on this display, opting for the more discreet Dragontrail Glass. Since this is going to be my daily driver, I didn't want to test the toughness (if Alcatel provides me a unit, Id gladly test it) but Ive looked into it and it trades scratch resistance for toughness. It might be easier to scratch it, but it is more resistant to shock. Only time will tell and I will update this review as time moves on.\n\n-Camera-\nThe camera is a back-facing 13 MP camera and a front, wide angle 5 MP camera. The rear camera uses a Sony Exmor IMX 214, which is the same unit found in the new Moto G and the more expensive Nexus 6. The results are mixed though. On one side, outdoor pictures are good. Whenever there is good lighting such as outside or a well lit room, the pictures do come out high quality with colors mostly accurate and the camera absorbing a lot of details. However, during the night, the picture quality takes a hit, with the camera struggling to get any details from the lack of light. It will get some details if they is ANY type of light, but not much. The lack of OIS also contributes to this issue, but there is no phone with OIS at this price range at the moment. The flash is okay, but since it isn't a dual tone unit, the light tends to overflow and photos tend to lose their details. Videos are also a similar story, with good lighting providing good results and the opposite being true. There is EIS, but the effect isn't that noticeable and it doesnt really help with the quality. This isn't a camera you're going to use for important, memorable moments. But for things that most people use, like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, it works great. This is especially true for the  front facing camera, with the selfie cam grabbing a lot of details, provided there is good amount of light.\n\n-Software-\n\nThis is basically running a close to stock version of Android Lollipop. It is running version 5.0.2 with a Stagefright patch already added to protect the phone from foreign attacks. There are a few changes to the software. For instance, the icons look like similar to the iPhone, which can be both a good and bad thing, depending on whether you love or hate that style. Other than that, everything works just like stock Android. Except for one feature that Im surprised isn't universal to all phones. That is the fact that this phone is reversible. It doesnt sound as exciting as fingerprint sensor, but it is a rather practical  and underrated feature. Ive answered the phone to test the sound quality and it wasn't until after I hung up that I realized the phone was upside down. It sounds equally good on either orientation and it is brilliant. Of course, if you don't like this (for some reason) there is always the option to turn it off. Overall, the light touch that Alcatel added onto Android hasn't hurt it much and any problems can be easily fixed.\n\n-Conclusion-\n\nI wasn't expecting to get a high quality phone, especially after my experience with an old model that I cant even remember the name. But Alcatel did deliver a high quality experience and an astonishing device. It does have some compromises, but Alcatel chose them wisely and the overall result is great. There is a couple of phones that compete in this range, but the biggest one is the Moto G. Is this better? Yes and no. For power users, I would still recommend the high end Moto G because of the extra RAM or even a OnePlus One, which is on sale now for $299. But if it must be under $200, like for college students like me, this beats the $179 low end Moto G due to the higher quality speakers, display, NFC, and the slightly more RAM. This phone helps to answer the question: Do people really need to spend over $800 on a phone to get a high quality experience? The answer for most people is no. They dont. There is a market for people who need to have the latest and greatest with all the new extras like fingerprint sensor and DSLR-like quality cameras. But for the rest of us, there are phone that does what we ask from it and reasonably well not just for the price, but just overall. If you are on the fence and frustrated from searching like I was, let me help you. Go for this phone and you won't be disappointed.", "summary": "Looking for the Best Budget Phone?

They performed flawlessly, cutting cabin noise to almost nothing, and they also allowed me to use my MP3 player without having to turn up the volume above my usual setting. Both the airplane cabin and engine noise were almost completely suppressed while still allowing me to clearly hear in-flight announcements.\n\nIn short, these are a *great* set of noise cancelling headphones that work extremely well and are priced very affordably. These are as good or better than the Bose headphones which cost 3 or 4 times as much.\n-----------------------\n\nWow. Simply put, these are great noise cancelling headphones, well-made and inexpensive. They knock out about 90% of common low-end, cyclical noise like fans, engines, compressors, etc and cost less than a 1/3 of the Bose noise cancelling headphones. I'll be testing these more against some high-end Bose headphones and also on a long airplane trip shortly, but my first impression is that they work very well. Turn them on and everything...just...gets...quiet. Standing next to a refrigerator and turning them on makes it sound like the refrigerator just stopped running.\n\nThey come in a nice travel case with 2 patch cords, a 1/4\" adapter, an airplane adapter, and a battery. The little pouch that holds the cords and  stuff detaches from the carrying case so you can put in a bag separately if you don't want to lug the carrying case around.\n\nThe instructions are a hoot- very spacey. For example, the instructions start off with this little bit of Zen prose:\n\n------------------------------------------\n9,000m in the sky, 7-hour time difference,\nover 7,000 miles apart.\nThe cabin mix with the travel tiredness and the unique smell,\nthe soul inside the body can finally relax.\nThis moment, rare and precious.\nChanging a pose and choosing an old song,\nPut on my headphone.\n\nA short rest,\nfor getting rid of the plane roaring,\nfor escaping preciseness and all the worries,\nfinding the real me and this moment of satisfaction,\nPursuit of a lifetime, mixed in the hubub and noise,\nI finally know the meaning of content in calmness,\n233621 grants you the best quiet space.\nSilence is Golden.\n------------------------------------------\n\nLol, what's not to like about that? :) The translation of the directions are a little bit shaky but still completely understandable. Plugging an MP3 player into them results in good, clear sound, no complaints there. The headband seems sturdy and is well-padded and the earcups also seem very comfortable- much better than the \"on-ear\" style.\n\nTwo very minor gripes: 1) I wish that the headphone cups would fold in (swivel) to store a little more compactly, but this is a very minor gripe.  2) The audio input jack on my pair is a little loose, but that's probably just this pair. If it gets too loose I'll return them for the exact same model, that's how much I like these so far.\n\nAll in all, I'm impressed with these and looking forward to using them and putting them up against the $350 Bose headphones. My guess is that there will hardly be any noticeable difference, and I'll update this to let you know what I find. But so far these seems to be an outstanding deal for the money.", "summary": "Work EXTREMELY well and are priced right!", "unixReviewTime": 1474156800}

Unfortunately, while it's a decent as a case, it's pretty weak as a battery case-- it only contains a 590mAh battery.  On the GPEL Amazon webpage's \"Compare to Similar Items\", the first battery case listed, also a Qi Wireless Charging Case offers a 3000mAh battery for four cents less.  That's five times better.  A brief and incomplete survey of Qi Wireless Battery cases on Amazon shows cases varying from 2200mAh to 10000mAh, but no other brand was under 1000.\n\nThe case is attractive. The back is sleek and silver-colored.  It adds barely more than half an inch to the length of iPhone 6 and 6s, and less than three-tenths of an inch each in width and depth. I wear a leather belt holster designed for the iPhone 6, and this case fits it with minimal snugness.  It has a slight overlap over the screen, protecting it when the phone is placed screen down on a table or desk, and the case itself serves protects against drops and falls.\n\nIt gives easy access to all the iPhone 6's buttons and switches, with the exception of the audio port-- because of the length of the case, the provided adapter is necessary (I often use Bluetooth earphones, so the issue doesn't arise).\n\nUnable to recommend, due to battery capacity.\n\n[I received this product at minimal or no cost, for the purpose of evaluation and unbiased review.

They are so much better than the dry application kind... when I first started using them, I was very careful about the liquid and dust/lint, etc... after having applied several sets of these to various phones and tablets over the years, I have become pretty cavalier about the application process.  I wash my hands with soap and water, do a few pumps of the liquid on my fingers that Skinomi includes, then a couple pumps on the phone and a couple more on the protector.  Then I peel off the protector from it's backing, slap it on the phone and align it just right.  Bring the the squeegee and squeegee off the excess water, trying to mostly avoid the holes (earpiece, etc...) in the phone and then dry it off with a cloth.\n\nI then let the phone sit over night still turned off and it's ready to go in the morning.  The screen looks pretty bad for the first 24 - 48 hours, but once all the liquid evaporates through the protector materiel, it is usually clear as glass and I've not yet had any real problem with dust.  If I had a complaint about wet application protectors is that they don't feel nearly as nice as glass and some dry application protectors.  This is really a minor quibble, but the rubbery material that these Skinomi protectors are made of kind of drags on the finger when you are sliding around the screen.  It's not bad, but not nearly as kinesthetically pleasing as sliding around the glass.  As I said, it's a minor quibble on an otherwise excellent product.  The fit on the Nexus 5 is spot on - I was a little concerned that it did not have cutouts for the light sensor and mass sensors (but it does for the speaker), but it doesn't seem to affect the performance of either sensor, so I guess they aren't necessary.\n\nOverall, an excellent product and I heartily recommend these to anyone looking for a screen protector.  Don't let the wet application scare you away, it's not really that hard and the fit and finish of the final product once installed is vastly superior to any dry application screen protector I have ever used (and I've used plenty!).", "summary": "Looks great, easy to apply!", "unixReviewTime": 1384128000}

NO air bubble.. all the cut outs line up, easiest install ever!!\n\nTo me it holds on to fingerprints easily, not too different from the actual screen itself, no distortion nor does it affect the display at all, and it is extremely smooth when sliding your finger around.", "summary": "Love it!", "unixReviewTime": 1452902400}

This is a non-bias review on the case. I received it 9/16/2015 and promptly installed it. This review will be updated for 7 days.**[/I]\n\nI have previously used ZeroLemon products for my Galaxy Nexus, Galaxy S4, and my girlfriends Nexus 5. I have found that the internal replacement batteries are much better than the externals, but the external ones come with cases that may actually give your phone a chance to live during a drop. I have so far enjoyed all of my ZeroLemon products.\n\n[B]9/16: [/B]Received ZeroLemon slim power case in the mail and installed it immediately, replacing my SUPCASE Unicorn Beetle Pro.\n\nThe first thing I notice was that this case literally doubles the thickness of the phone. Not only that, but it adds nearly half an inch to the bottom of the phone below the speaker. The battery included in the package fits very will in the case, but I'm still a bit shocked that ZeroLemon thought 3500mAh was enough.\n\nThe case comes with a Z-shaped connector to keep the phone and the battery connected, and allows pass-through charging via a micro-USB port on the left side of the phone. There is also a decent sized cutout on top for the 3.5mm jack, though they decided to include a 3\" 3.5mm extension with the case.\n\nTo turn the battery on, you hold the power button on the back for a few seconds and you will have confirmation by your phone beginning to charge, as well as 4 blue LED lights on the back of the case. This works exactly the same as all of their other cases for phones with non-user-replaceable batteries.\n\n[B]First impressions: [/B]\n\n-This thing is big. It's got a nice weight to it and makes it feel solid. Fits well in my hand (I have fairly large hands for a 25 year old male).\n-The power and volume buttons are EXTREMELY SENSITIVE. I can't tell you how many times I have accidentally pressed something when just picking the phone up.\n- No Qi-charging. Unfortunately, ZeroLemon does not give us a Qi capable battery, and the case is so thick that even a 3-coil charger will not penetrate it. (Now I have 2 nice Qi chargers that I can't use)\n-No Quick Charge 2.0. This (as well as not having Qi) was a real bummer. ZeroLemon had previously sent me one of their Quick Charge 2.0 chargers, but it seems that it is now useless as you are actually charging the external battery, which in turn charges the phone.\n-Single piece construction. The case itself feels solid, but I was hoping that it would be more like the one for the Nexus 5 that was 2-piece and had a plastic screen protector.\n\nThey really needed to include a belt clip with this case. It's that big. Because of the size and the buttons being so sensitive, I can't really carry the phone in my pants pocket. When I put it in the breast pocket of my shirt, half of the phone sticks out, and the thickness almost prevents it from sliding in at all. Not including some sort of belt clip was a very poor idea.\n\n[B]9/22:[/B]\n\nSo I've been using my ZeroLemon SlimPower case for about a week now.\n\nMore things of note:\n-NFC does not function with this case on\n-Full charge of the battery in the case gave me about 40% charge (went from 30% to 71%)\n-Buttons are WAY too sensitive. Just from being in my pocket and walking around, My battery life has been terrible (screen keeps turning on and off)\n-The case does not do a very good job of protecting the phone. The two times that my phone fell (once from the arm of the couch, the other from the coffee table), the case literally just popped right off. A case this large really needs to be 2-stage or have some way to hold the phone in better.\n-My cullular signal also seems to be hindered with this case installed. Where I would normally have a little bit of service at my office, I have no connection with this case on. Immediately when the case comes off, I have service again.\n-Have had the phone randomly restart on me 3 times since having this installed. Never had an issue with this before.\n\nAll of my initial impressions stayed with me the entire time using this case.\n\nI can see times where having the extra battery could be useful, but honestly, you are better off getting an External battery for the same price as this case or likely even less. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this case.", "summary": "Does not live up to the reputation of its maker.", "unixReviewTime": 1442880000}

The problem is that these films are impossible to apply without getting some dust and bubbles. I have gotten about 60% of the screen bubble/dust free but the rest is impossible. Because you peel away the film on the underside as you lay it down, the films create a static that draws dust as you get past about halfway. The instructions to clean the screen in a \"dust free environment\" is laughable. Do they think everyone has access to the clean rooms used in semiconductor fabs or operating rooms? The \"soft card\" intended to scrape away bubbles is also useless, better to just use a credit card with a longer and more usable edge. Perhaps it is worse here in dry Colorado where humidity is low? Another gripe, albeit minor, is that it is difficult to align the film straight over such a large surface. They should really make the front facing camera hole a little larger to avoid alignment issues. Maybe Apple should just start offering matte glass straight from the factory, because this is a waste of time. Politics is less frustrating that applying these films (and I've done it successfully on phones many times but the large surface area makes it impossible).", "summary": "Don't waste your time", "unixReviewTime": 1304553600}

I remember when under 3 inches was still a decent size. I got an HTC diamond and it had a 2.8 inch screen and I loved it. The iphone had a upped screen when it came out to with a huge 3.5 inch. Now we have phones coming out classified as mini (Galaxy s III mini) with a 4 inch screen. The huge phone displays look great but are awkward to hold, and in the pocket. 4inch has probably been my favourite size so far, I was excited about the lg viper but the design and battery life were really bleh. I recently gave a try to the Galaxy Victory and it was fantastic but the battery life and the size of it were just to much, so i'm swapping for this.\n\nI saw the galaxy victory and it seemed like the perfect fit. The phone is 4 inches, plenty of resolution for the size, plenty of ram, an S4 processor, decent design and decent sized battery (same one as the Galaxy S III)\n\nSo sorry for the ranting, here we go. I've put it through the tests over the day and I've had great results.\n\nThe screen looks great, It's LCD not an AMOLED but it gets the job done fine. I miss the contrast ratio when reading in the dark.\n\nIt performs really great, I put it through tests and games run great, running quadrant shows it really close to the htc one x. Really don't let the midrange category of this phone scare you off performance wise, the S4 is what is in some versions of the Galaxy S III and HTC One X, Its a S4 lite and lower clock but its not horribly far off.\n\nPhysical design while not the best, is not to bad either. The phone feels good in the had, it has a good texture and weight. I wish the power button was on the side but its not bad on the top. It has a camera button which I LOVE. Function buttons on the bottom are good though I wish there was a multitasking button (though you can just hold home to do it)\n\nSamsung's customizations are surprisingly fairly useful, the launcher isn't to distracting, performs well and has some good shortcuts over stock. However one bad thing is that folders are a bit more difficult to make, but its like just one more step. It comes with some of Samsung's applications and enhancements which are mostly fine, I tried out the S Voice and it was pretty terrible.\n\nbattery life has been pretty awesome, it almost matches my Galaxy Nexus with extended battery (3850 mah). To give my battery use today, I was at work from like 7am - 5pm today, my service at work is terrible like 0-1 bars most of the day which wrecks batteries. I texted about 30-40 texts probably, did some ebaying, a bit of web surfing, I did like a 5 minute gps nav, played a game for like 10 minutes, checked weather a couple times. When I got home my battery said it was unplugged for 11 hours and I had 60 percent left, I used the program \"easy battery saver\" also, I'm not sure how much that affected the battery life though.\n\nCamera seems to be fine, I'm not to concerned with quality on my cellphone, as long as it takes a picture and I can tell what it is, the camera button works great too.\n\nReasons I gave a 4: as mentioned above, some of the software (S voice) aren't to great but they aren't really needed either. The function buttons are fine but the home button for some reason has like a second delay before it does anything, which is slightly annoying. The phone has NO haptic feedback build into it, so if you need that it's a no go.\n\nSo really nothing to horrible unless you need haptic feedback, I highly recommend if you want a smaller phone on sprint.\ncomment if you have any questions, hope you enjoyed.\n\nEDIT: fixed the home button lag by disabling double home button tap for s-voice :D", "summary": "Great for people sick of the gigantic smartphone era", "unixReviewTime": 1350518400}

Ting runs off the T-Mobile's network, which means it'll work with almost any unlocked phone.\n\nUnlike other carriers, Ting charges you based on whatever level of usage you reach each month, so the more you use every month the more you pay. But usage is billed by level, so like a traditional plan, you could still end up paying for minutes or texts or data you never use. For instance, the \"M\" level for voice calls charges you $9 for any usage between 101 and 500 minutes.\n\nStill, this \"planless\" model is a pretty good deal if keep an eye on your usage and don't go overboard.\n\nNow you might be thinking \"Gee, this sounds like it could also be a great way to save money for my whole family or my business!\" Well if you are thinking that, not so fast! I tried this and it didn't work out well at all.\n\nFirst, unless you don't mind paying a ton when everyone streams movies or talks all night, you'll have to prevent unlimited use. Ting lets you set up caps to cut off usage after a certain number of minutes, megabytes, or texts is reached, but it's not reliable - and they admit it! For instance I capped data at 475MB to avoid going into the next level that starts at 500MB, but usage still hit 509MB before being capped. I contacted support and they said they cant cut off in-progress calls or downloads (and realistically, that would be a bad idea), so they recommended setting the cap lower. But the lower you set a cap in a level, the more likely youll end up wasting minutes or data (and money) - and no matter where the cap is, you could still end up in a higher level since caps don't trigger until a call or a download is finished... which means a really long call or download could still blow through a whole level or even more (P. S. caps on texting supposedly do work reliably).\n\nThe other problem is that although you can always login to your account and see the usage on all lines, theres no way for individual users to see their own usage. The closest you can get is to set up alerts that are triggered at a specific amount of usage - but the alerts only say how much youve used, not how much is left.\n\nFinally, adding/editing usage alerts and caps is a pain; you have to create separate caps and alerts for voice vs. text vs. data. So if you want to prevent all unlimited use, and you want to alert when getting close to your caps, youll have to create 3 caps and 3 alerts per line (it doesnt help that doing it on their site is tedious and slow).\n\nOverall, my take on Ting is that it's great for individuals who clearly understand the pricing model, but its a poor choice for families/businesses. Instead you might want to look at a cheap carrier with more traditional plans, such as US Mobile. Theyre a really good deal if you don't use your phone that much, but their prices are not as great for higher levels of usage. And like Ting they also have excellent support and also run on T-Mobiles network.", "summary": "Good until you try to limit usage", "unixReviewTime": 1459123200}

Its fingerprint sensor somehow adds to the beauty. The curved edged and clear display along with the sandblasted exterior make for a gorgeous device.\n  This phone is functional. It is fast, intuitive. I feel like the developers took everything you wished apple and Android iOS had, and they put it there. One instance, is on Apple devices you swipe up from the bottom of the screen to have a quick menu. You can turn off WiFi connection, get to the calculator, blah blah. I always wished with my iPhone 5s that if you held on the WiFi button it would take you into the settings for WiFi. Xiaomi does that! Holding on any toggle button will take you into the settings menu for that.\nIn addition, there is spotlight search just like Apple. If you swipe up from the bottom of the screen you get the same search options as you do on the iPhone. I have had 3 iPhones and 1 galaxy phone, and I miss NOTHING.\n  The display is true to life colors. It has less glare but is still glossy and the best one in its flagship class.\n  The only con is that it did not have Google play store on it. Check with this seller, they may have it on there. But when I bought it in the xiaomi store it only had the mi appstore on it, where I was able to download a few apps and follow along with a YouTube video to get Google play working great, and all the apps run as they should.\n  The fingerprint is pretty great. Placed on the back of the phone, by the time you pull it out of your pocket, it's unlocked. I especially love it because with the iPhone you had to wake the screen and then place your finger on the home button at the bottom. So many times this would make me loose my grip since I'm only holding the bottom bit of the phone and then boom my $500 device gets dropped.... Again. With the redmi, simply placing your finger on the sensor wakes the screen and unlocks the phone, you don't even need to press a button. Now I'll be honest. It isn't 100%. I get my finger read about 90% of the time, but at this price point I couldn't care less.\n  The phone has some really cool features. In the security app you can lock apps,  so if I wanted I could make snapchat require my fingerprint to open the app. There are hidden albums, and the folders hold unlimited apps.\n  One of the best in my opinion-- it's basically a computer. I plugged a micro USB flash drive into my redmi and I was able to move files, work on a word document, make and delete folders. I have never even seen that on Apple.\n  The battery life is to DIE for. 4,100 mAph has never run out on me even with a full day of use. I used to have to keep chargers everywhere for my galaxy and iPhones. One in the car, my bag, an extra battery, sevral around the house. Nope. I keep one charger in my bedroom and that is all I need.\n  Any new phone takes some getting used to. I keep finding new things I love  all the time and I've had this since the launch in February 2016. Do yourself a favor, pop over to Ebay and buy 1-2 tempered glass screen covers and a nice case. The glass costs me 0.99 with free shipping and the cases are 0.99-$6. Buy them at the same time as the phone, if not before. They will save you. I drop this poor redmi all the time and 3 screen protectors have shattered, leaving the actual screen unharmed.\n  I can't wait to see what xiaomi comes out with next, the next time I need a new phone it's going to be from them.\n\nupdate: It is now February 2017 and I still love this phone, and continue to find reasons to. The Mi cloud is very helpful as well and that just about all I have to add. 10/10 amazing device.", "summary": "Better than iPhone, Samsung, everything.", "unixReviewTime": 1470614400}

First I'd like to preface this review by saying that I've used it since Sept 2015 and it has held up (including the wallet part) til now which is quite remarkable for how little I paid. A few flaws: the major one is that it did not protect my phone when it fell from my 2 year old's hand onto the bathroom tile floor. It landed on the edge and the screen cracked. Well I got my phone fixed and have since gotten a glass screen protector that curves and covers the entire edges so we'll see if that protects better. Second major issue - the flash on the camera is partially blocked my the opening in the back so my flash pictures all have a pink hue, which is ok if you love every flash picture you take to be pink-hued, but that is not my intention. Third, the wallet flap on the back has stretched out a bit so you have to be careful that things don't slip out. I did overstuff it and I have 3 cards in the top pocket and 2-3 in the lower pocket. Also the stand has loosened as well and slips down/opens all the way occasionally. A few other minor quips - there is no lip on the front so when you have your phone face down, the glass is touching the table surface. Also I wish the credit cards were not so obviously exposed - I don't want people to see my cards and information so easily. Until I can find a better phone cover/wallet replacement, I'll continue to use this for now.", "summary": "Okay phone case but 3 major issues", "unixReviewTime": 1467072000}

(Data pulled from CNET)\nUSB 1.1  Top Speed 12mb/s  Max Power 2.5v or 500mA\nUSB 2.0  Top Speed 480mb/s = Max Power 2.5v or 1.8A\nUSB 3.0  Top Speed 5gb/s = Max Power 5v or 1.8A\nUSB 3.1 (TYPE C) = Top Speed 10gb/s = Max Power 5v or 5A\n\nThe reason this is ideal over other type c cables you see is that is has the extra function of converting to micro usb as well! Almost all phones are now either micro usb or type c in terms of charging-data ports.\n\nThis cable will ensure you always have the right type of charging  data cable.\n\nThis cord is 3.3 long and is flat in design which is the best type for keeping it from tangling!\nIt feels solid and has a nice coating to it.\n\nFollows TYPE C SPEC and will work with all your normal wall usb chargers and hubs.

This speaker became a big part of my everyday. I do not have a Bluetooth capable sound system in my car and I would use this little speaker daily on my commute to and from work and on other errands. I also used it all over the house to make cleaning more bearable and when playing with my son in his room. I treated it well and though it is \"water proof\" I kept it far from water most times because I wanted to make sure it would last through the long haul. Even with treating it well a little over a week ago I turned it on in the car and it emitted an earsplitting screech that scared me and my son and then wouldn't work. I turned it off and didn't try it again that morning. That afternoon I tried it again and it worked but the sound was so quite I could not hear it, even though it's volume was at it's highest and my iPhone volume was turned up to the max as well. Since then it won't ever turn on and it gets very hot underneath the command buttons. I am very sad about this. I am hoping this is just a fluke incident and that more people won't have this problem. Since I don't know that it is though I have taken it from 4 stars to 2 stars.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW: I really like this little speaker so far. It's a nice size. Small enough to take with you from room to room but big enough that you can easily find it if your one-year-old walks off with it. I also like that it is \"rugged\" because that same one-year-old does like to walk off with it but usually ends up dropping it after a few minutes when something else catches his attention. Being able to use it near my shower in the morning is a big plus. Because of the set up of my bathroom there are no electrical outlets near enough to my tub/shower for me to be able to use a normal radio. Since this is water resistant I can set it on the edge of the tub while I shower and leave my phone out of the way of the water and still be able to hear my audio book, a huge plus for me. The controls are easy to use and the battery life is pretty decent. I do wish the volume went just a few steps higher but I haven't had a problem with any sound distortion at the highest setting. The one real con I have is that the distance between my phone and this speaker has to be quite close or it loses connection or will do this weird skipping thing when my book/music plays. Most of the time this isn't an issue but when near the water I want my phone no where near it. Really, it's a great little speaker and I recommend it.", "summary": "A good little speaker . . .Except . . .", "unixReviewTime": 1437955200}

It fits his phone well but the door to the back part is easy to pop off if you open it too wide. Which is included in the listing that it would happen.

It's also pretty easily damaged.  Since my last ones looked like clutches, I hoped this one would look more like a little more masculine, like a checkbook cover or wallet. Notsomuch.

I was about to just buy the cheapest one, but saw that this one comes with a lifetime replacement warranty.  I have had difficulties in the past with screen protectors, and have screwed up my fair share, so a lifetime replacement definitely caught my attention.  Sure enough when I got these, I got lint on the first one I tried applying before I could properly adhere it.  When I tried to remove the lint I ended up dropping it on the ground!  The second one went on fine.  This only left me with one as a back up though.  Well just the other day, I found I scratched up the one on my phone somehow.  Having only one left I decided to contact Tech Armor to inquire about the lifetime replacement.  Sure enough, they let me know they would ship out a replacement as soon as I gave them my information.  No hassle, no haggle!  I would definitely recommend this screen protector to anybody looking for one.  Lifetime replacements!\n\n**Update**\n\nWell it was bound to happen sooner or later.  I dropped my phone, and of all places and ways to fall, it fell face first right onto gravel!  I picked it up half expecting the screen to be cracked, but it only had a few pits.  Or did it?  The Tech Armor took the full impact of the gravel.  It did get a few pits in it, but my screen was perfectly fine!  Tech Armor did it's job, and thankfully, because of their lifetime warranty I had extras to replace the damaged one.  Definitely still recommend using this screen protector.

The kit came with 3 screen protectors, a large cleaning cloth, dust removal stickers, and installation instructions and other documentation.  I've purchased many screen protectors in the past and this is the first time I've received a decent sized cleaning cloth.  It may not be a big deal to others but this was a pleasant surprise for me.  The install instructions were very detailed and straight forward.  They even had a website you could visit to watch a video of the installation process for those that need visuals.  Although they didn't have an install video for the Note 3, they did have a video for the Note 2.  The video instructions sequence was the following: Turn off phone, wipe down screen with cleaning cloth, remove tab 1 and apply screen protector, identify dust bubbles (not air bubbles) and use dust removal stickers to remove the dust, finish applying screen protector pushing out all air bubbles, and remove tab 2.  I figured why should I apply the screen protector first to identify dust bubbles.  After cleaning the screen with the cleaning cloth, I used a dust removal sticker all throughout the screen before applying the screen protector.  After doing this, I did not see a single dust bubble.  Once I pushed out all the air bubbles, the screen appeared crystal clear.\n\nOverall, this screen protector looks great.

However I went through at least 10 of them in 3.5 years\nEven though they are stretchy and support large phones, the stress is way too much so they break after 20-30 uses. But I must give it a credit, in my experience they only broke while I was strapping on or off the phone, not during the ride and only one corner at a time. And it still works fine holding 3 corners..\n\nSo the main flow - it's too small for large phones (5.7\"+).\n\nAnother minor issue, is the way they suggest you use it - with the little tab on top. This means that if you put bottom of the phone in the holder and top end slipped off your hand, then it will unwrap itself off your bike. So it's better if you do the top first then the bottom, but that means you must \"push\" the phone which is much less comfortable then \"pull\" towards you.\n\nTheir website doesn't have any means to contact them, that means they are not looking for public feedback.

You really have to follow the instructions down to the detail otherwise, you'll have a fly trap on your hands.  This thing has a smooth finish and it doesn't get in the way of swiping with my iPhone 5.  I suggest have a few paper towels or an Q-tip on hand to make sure you don't spill any on the earpiece of the phone.  It will drip a lot because it asks you to spray the solution on your hands and onto the front and back of the protector to prevent it from sticking to your fingers.  After about a few hours, you'll notice the imperfections start to go away and the remaining air bubbles just disappear after a full 12 hours. Plan on doing this overnight so that you'll have your phone back with you the next day.\n\nThe only bad thing about this product is that it only came with one measly protector.  Others come with at least two or three just in case you mess up the first one.  I would have given this a five star if it included a couple more screen protectors.  Overall, I do recommend this item but be patient with it to align it as best as you can.  I had to redo mine 2x to make it sit as evenly with the phone as possible.  You won't be disappointed once it's in place.  You'll even forget that it's there.\n\nUpdate: 2/12/13\n\nThey have this program called Skinomi Awareness Program where you get an invitation and they send you a free screen protector for your gadget just for participating.  I changed the 4 stars that I originally gave them to 5 stars since my only complaint was the package only came with one protector.  Since they sent me an extra screen protector, I couldn't be any happier they did exactly what they said they would do.  I have recommended, I do, and I will recommend Skinomi TechSkin to everyone I know that's looking for a high quality screen protector for their smartphone, iPad and other tablets.  Not to mention joining the Skinomi Awareness Program to receive a free screen protector would be the icing on the cake.  Thank you Skinomi!\n\nUpdate: 7/8/13\n\nNow the 5 stars I gave this product is down to three.  It's only been eight months and it's already losing it's resistance to yellowing.  My phone is on average use and has never been exposed to sunlight or moisture which most plastics tend to suffer from if exposed to this type of environment.  It's changing to a yellowish color. This wasn't expected since Skinomi claims that their screen protector is resistant to yellowing and scratches (it says so on the packaging).  The scratches passed the test, but the yellowing, not so much.  I have the white iPhone 5 and it looks \"dirty\" on the white parts of the phone now compared to when I first installed the screen protector.  I can safely assume this is going to get worse so I have changed my stance about this product.  I will be removing this screen protector soon.\n\nIf you have the black iPhone 5 then this is not a problem, but if you have the white, then this will be a problem.  To some people this might not be a big deal, as long as it's protecting the screen, right?  I respect that about you but if you're like me and you have invested money on an awesome phone, don't you want it to be protected and look good at the same time?  Not looking cheap and slowly turning yellow instead of a bright white?  This is just my two cents worth to anyone willing to read this.", "summary": "As expected but...", "unixReviewTime": 1353283200}

I'll assume you know all of that stuff by now and want an actual opinion from an average Joe smartphone user who's neither a technophile spechound nor a \"I don't know how to use thing thing\" newbie, but comfortably just the other side of center.\n\nThe phone is thin but not 'geeze I'm going to snap it in half' thin, large enough to be 'big' yet not ridiculous phablet-big, not too big to hold with one adult hand.  Not too big to fit in your pants or coat/jacket pocket.\n\nThe M9 is lightweight, but not a 'cheap' lightweight, kind of a 'just right' lightweight.  It's metal, so it has a good weight for its size and feels good in your hand.  I came from an HTC Rezound with extended battery (and therefore larger thicker rear door) and this phone was strangely thin the first few days of use.  If you're coming from another thin-type phone this likely won't feel too different.  If you have large (or small) fumbly man hands, you may want a grippy case for this one.\n\nThe phone is fast.  I have flipped the screens as fast as I could trying to get it to lag, but I couldn't.  It comes with up to 6 home screens (previous HTC phones had 7).  It comes with standard HTC widgets you may be used to, such as Calculator, People, Calendar, Email, etc (although it appears the stock Weather widget is gone unless I am blind), except they've all received a facelift.  It also comes with a new one, called Blinkfeed.  Blinkfeed is always the first screen to the Left of Home (swipe to the right to bring the Left screen over).  Blinkfeed, which I consider simply an updated and way more user-friendly \"Friendstream\" from previous models,  places your social media program contents (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, News) into tiled updates so you can scroll up & down and get it all on one widget, theoretically w/o having to go to your FB app or IG app, or CNN.  Old habits are hard to break, I still find myself preferring Instagram on Instagram and not on Blinkfeed, but I'm trying to give it a fair go.  I may just put a calculator there, who really knows....\n\nRingtones are all updated, as are text/email notifications.  They sound much nicer, crisper, modern.  The problem is, if you've been used to a certain tone- all your faves are GONE!  [tear].  Time to get used to new ringtones, especially if you had assigned tones and knew across the room who just texted you.\n\nThe notification bar at the top is updated with better results when you swipe it down.  It works faster, it contains more, is visually more crisp and tight, and swiping down with two fingers at once automatically opens the main settings screen such as WiFi, Airplane mode, Brightness, etc etc etc, with another gear symbol to open further settings.  It has a \"Glove Mode\" to make the screen extra sensitive for when you're wearing gloves.  Whatever you do, don't take off a glove!  :)\n\nApps in the \"app drawer\" or simply the 'app screen' as I call it, can be sorted into crowded mode (4 apps wide x 5 tall like they've always been), or 3x4 mode, which is far easier on the eye in my opinion.\n\nThe back button, home button, etc at the bottom of the screen are not hard buttons like on previous HTC phones, but are actually soft keys, or on-screen buttons at the bottom of the screen, giving the appearance of hard key buttons.  They can be customized too.  So if you want your back arrow button on the left, the right, the center- it's your call.  They've added a 'screen off' button to the mix too, which I added to the soft key row.  Now I can touch the tiny button to turn the screen off instead of having to use the physical power button on the side spine.  Love that.  Also there's an Open Apps button there too, with one-click cancel of all previous apps.  (This was done on older HTC phones by long-pressing the Home button and swiping each task off the screen one by one).\n\nIt has a zillion (approximately) other customizations, alerts, shortcuts, etc.  If you want to do a certain thing or make it look a certain way, chances are it will you just need to go into a setting somewhere.\n\nNice bright screen.  On full brightness I could easily view it bright sunshine, not sure if the 1080p resolution accounts for any of that, or if it's simply a brighter slew of LEDs, but it's decent on sunny days.  A tad better than other smartphones I've owned.  Slippery (in a good way) and tough Gorilla glass screen makes it easy to swipe on.  I seen a video where a guy was trying to scratch the front glass with keys and a knife and couldn't.  That's great.  (The rest of the phone however, including the camera lens, were far less resistant to scratches.)\n\nThe phone is very pretty, ughh, I mean attractive.  The silver on gold color looks classy and is a welcome change from the black I've had for years on other phones.  The aluminum body is brushed so it has a visual texture to it, adding to the classiness.  It has lots of  'leave out on the table for others to see' value to it.  Sexy, in other words.\n\nThe camera, even though 20MP, isn't terribly crisp, even in bright sunshine and on full resolution.  I don't understand this.  My HTC Rezound (from 2011/2012) takes stunning bright sunlight pictures and it's \"only\" 8MP (I understand MP has little to do with picture clarity, but one would assume improvements wouldn't lead to a drop in quality), and despite the negative reviews of the M9's low-light abilities, I thought bright light pics would be at least comparable to HTC's older phones (Incredible, Rezound) but it really isn't, which is strange.  This disappoints me a little but I don't lose sleep over it.  If you're the type that insists on the best of the best, the camera will likely disappoint you too.  But if you're a pro photographer, you won't be using your cell phone anyway.  Cell cameras are meant for taking pics at concerts, selfies, rollercoasters, your dinner at Applebee's, the big fish you just caught, and the shopping list you left on the counter being texted to you from your significant other.  Not the bridal party or Junior's 1 year pics.  it doe shave a slew of goodies in the camera bag.  Photobooth, Burst, \"Bokeh\" (pronounced bouquet, term for an in-focus subject w/ blurry background), 4K video (which ironically is a slower frame rate and therefore more choppy) and a host of on-board effects make it kind of fun to play with.  It snaps pictures fast, especially if you have the 'review' feature off. Snap snap snap, no lag at all.\n\nThe charge port is now on the bottom, just right of center.  Next to it, on the bottom now as well, is the headphone jack.  I don't prefer either of these changes but I won't lose sleep over it.  The charger plug still inserts with the prongs facing you, facing up, facing the screen of the phone...so be watchful of this when purchasing a dock.  I have read reviews on docks that people have bought saying the charger prong was backwards and wouldn't fit this phone.  Supposedly the soon to be released \"M9+\" comes with a reversible charger prong/port similar to Apple's iPhone chargers.  If that matters to you then there you go.\n\nThe volume buttons are still on the right spine. The Power button is now on the right spine as well, just under the volume buttons in the center.  I don't care that change either, but many people seem to prefer all of these button & port position changes.  I guess I don't know what everyone else knows or I'm not doing the same things others are doing and therefore don't appreciate these changes as much.\n\nNO replaceable battery.  So, if you found yourself needing to replace your phone's battery every year or two....guess what....now you'll probably need to replace the phone.  I am NOT a fan of this change.  This is the biggest disappointment to me.  I assume this is in an effort to make you need to get a new phone, win win for HTC and your carrier both, whether you purchase your phone outright or extend your contract to get it for a discount.  Lose lose for Joe consumer who would just replace the battery when it began failing [me].\n\nIt does have an SD card slot, right spine near the top.  Since the back of the phone is not removable, the SIM (left spine, top) & SD cards need inserted externally.  The phone comes with a 'tool' to poke into the little hole to pop open these tiny trays to insert the cards into.  The SIM card comes pre-installed, at least mine did as a Verizon upgrade.\n\nThe sounds is great.  Music is loud.  Not knock your socks off loud but great for a phone.  BUT- and notice this- it's still a cell phone, so don't expect the world when playing music for the first time.  They are the best cell phone speakers I've ever heard, but they're still cell phone speakers.  The Theater mode makes it sound like a very nice spacious stereo, which is unique to cell phone speakers.  Your other sound option is Music mode.  Only these two options.  Music mode is *slightly* louder, but less stereo effect.  I really like the theater mode myself.\n\nThe battery is great, at least now while it's new.  I got 16 hrs of light use yesterday (pocket most of the day, occasional email checks periodically) and it still read 52% at midnight.  It's a 2840 mAh battery.  To put that into perspective (if that's Greek to you), my Rezound, which I bought an extended thick battery for, had a 2750 mAh extended battery.  This is better than that extended battery.  Very decent for a stock battery.  Sure, there'll be reviews where people complain they watched Netflix and played 1080p games on full brightness and the phone was dead by 1pm....boo hoo.  It's a phone, you have to be reasonable in your expectations, and this battery does great if you're rational in what you expect and use the phone for normal average things.\n\nIt gets warm when charging, and it gets warm when you're using it heavily.  And it gets warm when you're charging it AND using it heavily.  So get over it.  It's an electronic device with a battery, there's a lot of chemistry and physical science going on inside this metal body, you're going to feel heat from all of that.  It's not hot and it won't hurt you, it is what it is.\n\nSurely I'm forgetting many things, but I tried to hit the basics in case you're familiar with HTC phones are considering this as an upgrade.", "summary": "A review from a realistic, average smartphone user- no super techy talk or redundant specs", "unixReviewTime": 1435449600}

Blum", "reviewText": "I haven't had a chance to use it much, it just arrived today, but I wanted to post my initial positive response to the item.\nI bought this for my wife who, despite the news stories to the contrary, is not a narcissist.  The problem with photography is there is too much in the way of the photographer getting in the shot.  Yes, it's OK for the photographer to be in a picture.  It's O.K.\nDoing the arm-length selfie results in a lousy picture for a lot of reasons, too close, not enough background if you're somewhere interesting, front-facing camera usually lower resolution, and arm.\nSelfie stick solves all of those problems.\nGet it set with the view you want then turn your phone around for HD camera.\nThe BT shutter control was a breeze to connect, cam-lock telescoping sections are quick to extend and are keyed so they will not twist, grip is adequate, 1/4\"-20 on BOTH ends, and there is a little convex chromed insert below the camera mount that gives you an idea of what the camera is seeing if you cannot see the screen.\nI'm uncomfortable yanking open the jaws far enough to accept an iPhone 6+ but with the 1/4\"-20 adapter I can come up with whatever I want and change cameras without much hassle.\nIf you have NO interest in using the BT remote for other applications it might benefit you wrap a rubber band or nylon tie around the handle to make sure it doesn't pop out and get lost in the trunk or back seat.  I'd like to glue it in but the battery will need to be replaced at some point.\nFor maximum stability and perhaps longer product life: when extending the sections leave an inch or two unextended on each section.  This takes the load off the plastic end and adds stability.  Lots of friction on the cam-locks, may hit them with a drop of light oil on the hinge pin and the point of contact.  Will update if that causes it to self-destruct.\nA saying in the US is \"That's why we can't have nice things.\", in this case it would refer to all the lunk-heads who've given the selfie stick a bad name. If you can find a place where these are allowed the Fugetek seems very nice out of the box.  Will update if that changes.\n\n(edit)\nAlright, just noticed that it's a rechargeable remote so I may glue it in after all.\nStrapped a spare Otterbox holster to the Fugetek clamp with a couple of nylon ties.  Note how bottom of holster rests behind lip of the included clamp.  This adds much stability to the installation.\nIt'll be easy to forget to turn off the remote, there's always the built-in timers on most phones and cameras.\n\n(another edit)\nIf you plug in and run your headphones with integrated microphone down from your phone close to the grip, or even hold them in your hand, the microphone input will switch to the mic built into the little part on the earbuds that changes the volume.  By getting the microphone closer to you your voice will be louder and will offset the proximity effect of having your mic way out on a stick.  You can also get dedicated microphones that you can use, but this is cheap and effective.", "summary": "Nice accessory, OK for non-narcissists to use.", "unixReviewTime": 1436140800}

The button pushed easily and took a photo every single time. It really makes getting group shots where no one is left out or a selfie super easy.\n\nThe package contained:\n1 x UrPower Bluetooth Self-portrait Monopod\n1 x Smart phone holder(2-2.7 inch in width)\n1 x Smart phone holder(2.6-3.3 inch in width)\n1 x Orange rubber pad\n1 x User guide\n\nDisclaimer: I received this item for free or at a reduced price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.

I started with the 1200 minutes/texts/mb plan with a year of service so it won't expire too soon, and that was a good choice for me since I don't make calls often, and only use data for quick checks when I'm not on wifi.\n\nThe phone is awful though. Google Maps crashes all the time and I can't use it. Browsing the web reminds me of the days of dialup, and it's purely because this phone can't handle it since I have very fast wifi at home. It works okay for calls, though when I switched, many people told me my call quality had dropped and they had a harder time hearing me. Both the cell signal and wifi signal are significantly reduced compared to other phones being used in the same place. I restart the phone before expecting to surf the web to at least start out fresh, but that just brings it from 'barely usable' to 'mediocre'.\n\nThe camera is a piece of junk. Image quality is awful compared to any other phone I've used. The tint is always off, the images are grainy, and they never seem to focus well. Forget being able to snap a pic of something up close to research later, as any picture closer than 5ft has never came out in focus. This may be acceptable for instagram, but for anything else it's way sub-par.\n\nThe only good thing about the phone is battery life. I mostly left it alone and once got 6 days on standby before it got to 10% battery. With my typical use, I get about 2 days. You really only get about 3 hours of heavy use, so if you are playing a game, surfing the web, responding to emails, etc. it will die pretty quickly, and this mostly seems to be due to having the screen on. I bought a spare battery for a few bucks which works great too, as a backup for traveling away from outlets.\n\nThe trick I've found to making the most of Tracfone is to route your number through Google Voice. Since I take most of my calls at home by a computer anyway, I can just answer the calls on Google and not use any minutes. Texts sent via Google Voice are free also, but you pay for the ones received. Wifi is the key to limiting data use too, and I leave data off unless I am actively using it. This has meant that I can get by on about 2000 minutes per year which means I pay at most $200/yr for service.", "summary": "It was the best Tracfone at the time, that isn't saying much", "unixReviewTime": 1395878400}

It is what you have seen...a very well made product.  Otterbox makes high quality stuff.  And yes, i did get the updated design with the big camera cutout. Everyone can tell you the goods about the Otterbox.  I am not here to repeat those things.  I am here to tell you about ONE MAJOR FLAW:\n\nThe problem is that when you put your iphone into the holster, you better be sure that NOTHING is caught in it.  In other words, if your shirt tail is in between the holster and the Iphone, then the iphone is NOT clipped in!!  It may feel like it is clipped in, but as soon as you turn and your shirt pulls out (of the holster), your Iphone goes flying out!  This happened while i was walking and i heard my iphone dropped to the ground.  The case itself protected my Iphone well.  I was lucky...not because the case protected my Iphone, BUT because i heard it fall!  If i was in a busy building, then i would have lost my Iphone because i would not be able to hear my iphone dropping to the ground.\n\nThe only way around this is to conciously use one hand to lift your shirt up and use the other hand to clip the Iphone into the holster.  Two hand method.  Forget rapid holstering of your Iphone with this Otterbox!!  Now, if you tuck your shirt in, then this may not be a problem.  However, you better be sure that the tucked shirt is nicely tucked in or else part of the shirt can be caught in between the holster and the case...and you have the flying Iphone syndrome all over again!\n\nOther minor negatives:\n- The screen protector does dull the beautiful retina screen a bit, but functionality remains excellent.  This was expected and i did not mind at all.\n\n- Bulky...when i sit in my car and strap my seatbelt in, i can feel the holster/case pressing against my side hip bone...maybe a comfort issue on long drives.\n\n- It is kinda hard to clip the case onto the holster, unless you slide it in perfect.  Just a little to the left or right and you will not be able to clip it in.\n\nSo, i think that the product is very well made.  The new rubber surround is very high quality.  But, the flying Iphone issue has made me look for other alternatives.  This is sad for me because i have high respect for Otterbox...i bought cases from them for my Ipod Touch 3rd and 4th gens.", "summary": "Good with one major flaw!", "unixReviewTime": 1320624000}

That said, this is the current phone that is not only an excellent phone (no call drops period) that is also the highest fidelity personal music server too if you use quality phones in a wired configuration.\n\nI have an Xperia Z3 and I love it.  The 3Z+ raises the bar just a little bit which for some will be quite meaningful and for others (those who own the 3Z presently) will likely not be earth-shattering as a reason to upgrade.\n\nYou probably already know the latest version of the Xperia is virtually the same phone called the 4Z in the world outside of North America.  Sony wisely chose the Z3+ name for a phone that is amazingly just the same phone as the recent Z3 only tweaked.  Its  got a faster (processor is currently one of the state-of-the art mobile processors), a very very slightly tweaked screen (res is still full HD w/ color and glass improvements), and the phone gets a bit marginally thinner (battery does shrink, but only slightly).  The camera is still excellent except in the lowest lighting and there I cannot say it is changed either plus or minus).  My forward camera does actually seem to be noticeably better even if it shouldnt on paper.  As for the battery life even with a slightly smaller battery this Sony Xperia 3Z+ is so very close to the original 3Z Im inclined to call it the absolute best lasting high-powered smart phone extant.  Without any ridiculous web usage you can still stretch it to two days with one day often still having approximately 40% batter when I plug in.\n\nWhat really separates the 3Z+ is the emphasis Sony has put on audio quality for anyone who is into high-resolution audio files.  Ive yet to download any format of HD-Audio files that cant be decoded.  Also, the fidelity is off the chart when used with any high-quality wired cans.  Also, I have 2 highly-rated Sony Bluetooth cans and they both sound impeccable over Bluetooth at up to 40-ft. in my home.  Excellent!  Sony also includes a pretty impressive engine that UPS the lower resolution MP3 files to where I, personally, believe they sound better than Ive ever heard them when using wired cans.  Hey, this is a fantastic phone (remember the first function) that is almost like getting the Sony +1000 Walkman included at no charge.\n\nSony has really hit a sweetspot in the screen.  This is the best full HD screen Ive ever seen.  It will rival QHD screens in overall appearance and it doesnt take that killer hit in battery life the other QHD screens seem to just annihilate.\n\nSo, if your an Android lover and a music lover who isn't hellbent on getting the screens approaching 6 there is absolutely no reason to not pull the plug.  The Sony Xperia 3Z+ is currently one of the most water repellent phones on the market too.  It will like drop into up to about 4 feet in water for between 30-45 minutes without any problems according to most accounts and Ive washed mine without powering down so I have no reason to doubt it really has extra water resistant qualities (no Im not submerging it in a pool just for testing).  As for cosmetics this one ups the 3Z slightly too.  It has the same glass back which does attract fingerprints (not a big deal), but with better impact screen resistance (this is only good because Ive dropped my 3Z repeatedly without harm).  I do like the increased memory of this phone versus my 16GB 3Z, but with the memory card option on both this only a small, but meaningful improvement.  All in all, this a beautifully constructed phone with a metal surround chassis covered with exceptionally strong glass front and back and integral 4-corner bumpers.  Its a phone designed with top quality industrial appearance and real-world toughness.\n\nIf you sense I love the 3Z+, I certainly do!  I have had absolutely no problem with the noted heating problem.  The hottest my original 3Z ever got was when updating the Android OS and since this one shipped with the latest Android OS Ive experienced no overheating in my typical usage at all.  Im not saying this isn't something a gamer or someone recording 4K videos won't experience as I have not tested either.  Im only saying for more folks than not the overheating will likely never be something youll experience.  I really think for someone like me who loves music this is the top phone currently available that is also a fantastic actual phone.  I use mine with Cricket Wireless and Ive got excellent coverage and have never dropped one call.  So, if you're at all similarly minded I suggest you seek out this excellent phone!  BTW, in full disclosure I got this 3Z+ at no upfront cost to test and I purchased my previous 3Z slightly used at almost $500.  The 3Z+ isn't easy to find except at Amazon (not always available here either), but I'd have to say this is one phone worth the cost if you want a robust phone that is an exceptional music server too.  It's absolutely beautiful.", "summary": "Perhaps The Best Android Phone As Of Late 2015", "unixReviewTime": 1450224000}

Because the USPS does not include Delivery Confirmation with First Class mail with out additional fees I was charged additional postage. The Cost of Priority Mail plus Confirmation Delivery.  Instead of the regular handling fee the seller charged with the additional postage I wound up paying over $6.00 for shipping and handling.\n\nI had asked for Standard Delivery.

Thats true, this is the most important aspect of screen protection. But, what about protecting the data displayed on the screen? I have seen privacy screens for laptop screens, but this is the first I have used with a mobile phone and it works exactly like the laptop screen protectors.\n\nSimilar to a regular screen protector, this is a thin sheet of glass that applies very smoothly and easily with no bubbles. It has fine screen coverage to the edge of the phone - this has been an issue on some other screen protectors I have used but not this one.\n\nWith this screen protector in place, the screen is definitely darker than usual and it might be helpful to adjust the screen brightness. It is a lot like looking at your screen through a pair of sunglasses. Turning the phone at a 45-degree angle makes the screen appear completely black as if the screen has been turned off - no light can be seen at all.\n\nBefore I put this protector on the phone I held it up to a light source and saw a repeating pattern of the light source itself, almost like I had held up a mirror to a mirror to get a replicated image. I think this protector works via polarized light and the repeating image is an effect of that - I have seen similar phenomena when wearing polarizing sunglasses.\n\nIf protecting the data on your phone screen is as important to you as protecting the screen itself, this is the screen protector you need. It works great, is easy to apply and is sufficient protection for you phones screen to prevent physical damage. Just make sure you have the right one for your model of phone.\n\nDisclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

However, I do like the ridges on the side a lot!\n\nThe charger port could be a hair taller to accommodate the cheaper, thicker chargers; though, it handles Samsung's default charger wonderfully.  The black portion also comes off, should you want \"less case\" or whatever.  I like it, it's attractive.\n\nMy kids have not dropped their phones, so I cannot speak to the most important aspect of having a case for a phone, but for an inexpensive case, it fits well and looks good.  Feels nice in the hand (though a tad smooth with the plastic, the side ridges make up for it), the buttons are aligned well, but are plastic and not recessed at all (for people who look for that - or avoid it).\n\nOverall, we are thus far satisfied with the cases.  Be careful with the kickstand", "summary": "Not a bad choice for the price!", "unixReviewTime": 1451692800}

My standard case has no problems clicking into place and staying on. I'm not sure if the new case is bent, doesn't fit right in general, or if the bulging from the extra equipment inside causes it to not fit correctly. It looks like it should fit and that there are no cosmetic defects to prevent it from fitting.\n\nThe touchstone, cable and power adapter all fit together and plugged in. There are no lights, vibrations or other notifications to let you know if it's working.\n\nI connected the back to the phone (As best I could) and it fit well onto the touchstone. There are magnets in the back plate that kind of force it into the correct position on the touchstone. But, when I connected the two, it constantly connects and disconnects the charger. No amount of moving it around the touchstone allows it to connect more than a millisecond and then it flutters back and forth between connection and not connecting.\n\nI could not get it to work, I've been messing with it for a week. I've read online that any of the 4 pieces (touchstone, cable, outlet connector, or back plate) could be causing it to not work correctly. I can either return the whole thing or start buying new pieces and see if I can figure out which one is messed up.

It'll fit, you just have to take a razor blade and cut off the tabs on the inside of the battery cover that don't line up with the slots on the back of your phone. The first cover I received was cracked due to careless mail carriers, so I felt safe experimenting on it since it was damaged anyway and I found that if you cut off a few specific tabs along the sides, it'll go right on.

The piece will also slide out if you for some reason didn't want to carry it or wanted to use the wallet without it.\n\n Inside is tan (as well as the closure small strap). Small strap closure easily snaps and has 2 different snaps to choose to close it. There are pocket holders for another 10 cards inside. Also there are 2 large pockets for your paper money and can use the other for receipts or important papers. If you have a thinner phone, you can also keep your phone in one of the pockets too.\n\nFinally, it comes with a small carry wristlet strap you can attach or leave off if you prefer. Attaches and detaches easily. Perfect for a man to keep in his briefcase or woman for her purse. Definitely love this and absolutely would recommend it.

I replayed at some part of the video. I took about 1 hour and 30 minutes. For a first timer, this kit is great. Video was very useful. My only complaint, really, was the screw drivers (all of them actually). They could use magnetic tips because these are some of the smallest screws I've seen. It was not easy to remove and install them without magnetic tip screw drivers. But they're free and provided so. I did not need to use all of the tools in the pouch. I do have a white screen so it's a step or two less than the black screen. There were 2 or 3 screws that didn't want to come off using the phillips screw driver provided so I had to use one of my screw driver at home with a large tip to remove them. Last but not least, the tamper glass screen protector arrived broke in the package so it's useless. I had to install my own screen protector. In the end, once everything was putted back together, I was really afraid that it won't turn on but after 4-5 seconds it did. Speaking of which, the first time turning the phone back on, the color was a bit off from the original screen but after an hour or so, it went back to normal. Strange. All of all, I spent approx. $60 and it took me about 1 hour 30 minutes. I'm happy.", "summary": "iPhone 6 screen replaced", "unixReviewTime": 1473292800}

Also it doesn't have a lip to protect the screen when you lay the phone face down.  The Power button and Volume buttons are also hard to use because they are so close to the top of the cut out.

I ordered this as an alternative mount for my GoPro Hero2. Anyone who owns a GoPro knows that once it is in its waterproof case, the audio becomes muffled and weak. Using a skeleton case is an alternative but takes time to change out all the pieces. I took a chance and ordered this, waiting to see how well it works. I am happy to say that it holds the GoPro nicely with gentle rubber clamps with just the right amount of tension. Not too hard, not too soft; just right.\nOf course I don't plan on using this in rough conditions, but as a casual, stand-alone mount (with a mini-tripod, not included) to capture things like party activities while sitting on a table. Much less intimidating method than sticking a camera in someone's face.\n\nI am very happy with this purchase, and I can use it with my smartphone, too.\n\nUpdate, August 7, 2014:\nAs other reviewers have noted, the plastic fittings are the weak point of this product. First, the threaded base separated from the mounting column (the upright portion, the parts are separate), then recently one of the hinges broke; the plastic portion that connects to the metal pin. I repaired both with superglue, but I wanted a good replacement so I ordered another one. After all, the price is low enough.\n\nLike others have also said, I wish just the stress points were either made from metal or at least a stronger material. I use this every day as a smartphone mount (it keeps the phone screen near vertical and helps the battery to stay cooler). I retain my 5 star rating since this is probably not meant for everyday or rough use. Still worth the cost since it did last from November last year to August this year (about 9 months).", "summary": "Adaptability, usable with GoPro Hero2 camera.", "unixReviewTime": 1384732800}

It just extends a little further than other screen protectors.\n\n- If you don't put this on absolutely perfect, and when I say perfect, I really mean PERFECT you will notice it.

Before I got this charger, I could not use my phone for navigation or music while charging.  My battery would deplete a little faster than other chargers charge.  This one is great!  It charges my large battery quickly even when being used.  I took away the 1 star because, like a lot of other reviewers stated, the cord is very short.  In my work car I keep my phone in the center console next to the outlet so it's not a big problem.

Just don't use it too far from the power source.\n\n**Update: I purchased this August 2014 and it is now March 2015.  This charger no longer puts out the 2.1 amps.  It is only putting out 460 mA.

I did not (and don't recommend) the 6 foot deep limits I've read you could do.\n\nThis is a very thin case for a fully wrapped case. Unlike Otterbox, this one adds very little thickness. It still feels like a smaller phone.\n\nI found the screen to be responsive and the buttons are all in the right place. It did not affect my use of the phone.\n\nCONS:\nAs for protection this isn't the best case. If you want shock and drop protection I'd recommend an Otterbox or even an Incipio.\n\nI've seen one of these get dropped a couple times and the clips not hold it together well. (I wonder if the warranty on the waterproof would still work if the case was slightly damaged. I think not.) It doesn't hold up as well and it won't protect your phone as well.\n\nThere is no warranty for if your device breaks from a drop or fall. This is normal, but it isn't really \"life proof\" is it?\n\nOverall a nice waterproof case that isn't as strong or safe as some others like the Otterbox. It is thinner though and much better than snap on cases. I like it, but don't love it.", "summary": "For Water Not Drops", "unixReviewTime": 1368403200}

Let me explain.  There is a tiny little piece that connects to the USB end of the charging cord and that tiny little piece goes in the USB end and has a micro USB on the other end.  There is no holder or place to put the little removable chip/piece when it's not in use and if you use it then the battery is pretty much useless.  The battery itself does NOT have an USB inlet/outlet.  It ONLY has a micro USB hole for both outgoing power and for charging.  In addition, the battery and cord are two separate entities so you have to keep track of both to use the charger.  I have another external battery, similar to this one, but that one has the charging cord attached to the battery and so once it's charge you can just grab it and go - no need to carry a cord around with you, the cord just tucks in the side and untucks for easy charging of devices.  So it is well made - made of quality materials, but the design just isn't the best nor is it convenient to use.  If I loose that tiny little chip then I can't use this charger unless I find a cord that is just a micro USB to a lightning on either end.\n\n________________\nMade by: Bestoss\nMade in: China\nColor: Black\nASIN: B01B2IQL1K\nProvided for review by: Bestoss\nShipped by: Amazon.com LLC", "summary": "Well made.", "unixReviewTime": 1461024000}

I share the other reviewer's praises.  Nokia's Asha 311 is very well designed and the in-phone and online software is beautiful.  Everything is well thought out and relies on simplicity rather than complexity but has plenty of firepower (my past Pantech and HTC phones prove just the opposite).  Read the online manual to see what I mean.  If you want a phone that has most capabilities but don't want to pay the extra mandatory $40/mo or so for smartphone internet access, this is it.  The touch screen is a new experience for me--very sensitive, yet not prone to errors.  I bought it for use abroad, but can use it with my AT&T sim card in the US.  (To be picky, the phone is perhaps a tab small--would like it very slightly larger!)\n\nI've been disgusted with the \"locked\" phones AT&T offers in their stores, and now its down to just a handful of non-smart phones.  With an unlocked phone you can purchase an independent sim card for about $50/mo. which gives you lots of talk and internet time--much better than the major carrrier's contract rates. (Some sims actually use the same network as AT&T, so you get the same quality.  Note that Verizon's network is incompatible with most unlocked phones).  So no more 2 year contracts--take THAT AT&T!  Check out [...].  \"Locked\" phones are a US phone carrier scam that does just what they say--locks you into high monthly fees.  Europeans have been enjoying the benefits of unlocked phones for years and now we can too.  Hope this helps.\n\nFurther comment:  Took off one star because internet access won't work using AT&T network in the states--you must use WiFi.  Also their downloaded maps are not the greatest.  Talk and sms are good, as is Nokia support.\n\nUpdate, April 8, 2013.  Many hours later, I finally DID get internet access.  With Nokia's help, found an AT&T forum that gives the internet (web) and MMS (multimedia) settings you need to plug into your phone so it will work properly (presumably they only work if you're with AT&T). So I'll restore the star I took off before.  Here's the link for the magic info (some terms were slightly different on my Asha.  note that this is for a Nokia C3 phone, but it still works):\n\n[...]\n\nOn my Asha 311, I went to \"Tools, configuration, personal settings\".  Create and set up the \"AT&T MMS\" settings, and then the \"Media Net\" (web) settings.  Call Nokia if you have trouble.\nHope this helps others avoid the multiple hours of set-up.", "summary": "Great non-smartphone", "unixReviewTime": 1363737600}

Cheng", "reviewText": "I'm trying hard not to let my perfectionist tendencies influence this review.  I was able to get the glass on the phone and it looks like it'll do a good job protecting most of the screen.  However, in the process, I left a portion of my fingerprint on the adhesive, as well as a few dust specks.  It's good enough now and unless I look for these issues, they shouldn't bother me in my day to day usage.  But it is frustrating given the amount of time and care I put into placing this screen protector on my phone.  If this were solely my fault, I would give this 4 or 5 stars for the protection that it is providing.\n\nBut there were two issues that TechArmor could have resolved: first, the screen protector doesn't cover the entire screen.  Now I've seen the reviews that say it wouldn't, but I assumed that it meant the display part of the screen would be covered, but that the bezel would not be.  That's not the case - there's a minuscule gap in coverage on the left and right sides when the display is centered.  Please see photos.  It's not very large but it's there and while I can learn to live with it, that was not my expectation so when I initially lined up the screen protector for placement, I only checked that it was lined up over the speaker grill per the instructions.  Once placed, I realized that the coverage on the sides was uneven and it was very apparent just by glancing at it.  I fixed it but that's when my fingerprint ended up on the adhesive side.\n\nWhich leads me to my second gripe - the speaker grill is ever so slightly off center.  To make sure there was an equal amount of coverage on the left and right sides, the speaker grill cutout was slightly off center.  Because the instructions noted that the speaker grill should be used for centering, this contributed to my initial placement issue.\n\nI don't know if other screen protectors have this issue, and I'm fine with it if this is the best that can be done unless you purchase the E2E protector.  But it would be helpful to show in the instructions what the final product looks like so you can see that the alignment on the sides won't be perfect.  That way, we'll know to align by the speaker grill and the sides of the glass.  This would've prevented the misalignment and the subsequent correction that left a fingerprint and speck of dust on the underside of the glass.  That is the major issue here.\n\nThere is one more minor issue that comes with the screen protector not fully covering the display portion of the front of the iPhone - the refraction on the edges of the screen can be annoying.  When seen at an angle, you see a sliver of the screen that is uncovered, the refraction from the curved edge of the screen protector, and then the covered part of the screen protector.  It's not a big deal, but it's there nonetheless.", "summary": "Decent screen protector but alignment issues are annoying", "unixReviewTime": 1452038400}

We're going to seek a replacement from Amazon for the rose gold band and switch to a different color for my wife.\n\nAs for the fit and function of the band, we give it 5 stars all the way.", "summary": "Great Gear S2 band replacement, but choose color carefully", "unixReviewTime": 1471478400}

Due to the big 6.1 inch screen size, I am having hard-time in finding smartphone holders that can accommodate the 3.5 inch wide phone body. Most of in-car smartphone holders can open up-to 3.4 inch wide only.\n\nIf the vehicle to be installed is a mini-van, van, SUV or pickup, then the 22 inch size is better. For sedan, the 18 inch option is sufficient. I installed the seat rail mount to my 2014 Odyssey mini-Van. The installation work is not hard, but need some palm-size handy tools around as the working space is tight inside the car. The metal goose-neck neck of this rail mount is pretty stiff but bendable. That's good as it keeps the shape once I bend it into final position.\n\nThe 360 degree swivel of the phone mount is very flexible, as my phone can pivots to any direction. During driving, the goose-neck does shake but not too much.\n\nOverall, this is a solid phone holder that can sustain quite some abuse.

The material used is grippy in the hand, yet slick enough not to catch on materials such as pockets and not pick up lint and hold on to it like silicone bumpers can do. Putting on the case is like putting on a bumper case...just pop the phone in, backside first and pop the cases corners over the phones corners. The back is fully covered except for the area near the camera & flash which is to be expected. The fit is nice and snug without being overly tight. There are some additional grip ridges near the bottom sides which help quite a bit when holding the phone...a nice touch.\n\nThe case is very slim in spite of the protection it adds to the device. The corners are thicker than the rest of the edges which puts more shock-absorbing martial where its needed...on the corners where the device will likely hit upon impact. No drop tests were done, however, I can see the phone surviving pretty well with no damage if dropped to the floor from a normal arms-length distance. Note that the screen itself is not protected nor covered by the case, except for the raised edges and corners which should protect it somewhat if dropped onto the screen itself and it lands in a somewhat flat manner.\n\nAll of the phones buttons work well through the case and the cutouts for the microphone and speaker are very precise. The lightning connector opening should work fine and accommodate any Apple or MFi (Made for iPhone/iPad/iPod) certified cable. The headphone jack opening works fine with the standard Apple headphones/earPods but I have no other brand of headphones to test this functionality any further.\n\nCosmetically, the case is very glossy due to the material used so of you don't like this type of flash or prefer a flat, non-glossy look, look elsewhere. I personally did not care for the etched internal line pattern on the case. It distracts from the clean look that having a minimalistic-type case would bring to the device. The NewTrent logo is fine however. Again, this is pretty much personal preference and doesnt deter that much nor affect the cases functionality.\n\nAll in all, a great minimalistic bumper-type case from New Trent!\n\nDisclaimer: I am a New Trent Pilot User so the item reviewed was provided to me for only a minimal charge.

It is a fragile fingerprint magnet if you don't use a cover.\n\nHaving used the LG G2 as my primary phone for the last 2 months and a half I think it is enough time to write a fairly competent review of my experience. My experience with the device has been very pleasant. I love the phone, but as with any other electronic device it has its pros and its cons. I will explain with more detail each of the above pros and cons below.\n\nPros (continuation)\n\n1. Probably the single most important thing a smart phone needs to have is good performance. In this aspect this phone certainly delivers. It is fast, very fast. It will handle pretty much anything that you can throw at it. I currently have 1 live wallpaper running behind three home screens that have a total of 4 widgets. It still runs flawlessly. The transitions and animations are smooth and lag free. My previous phone was a Galaxy S3 and even though that phone was no slouch you can definitely tell the difference between the S3 and G2. I have seen the biggest improvement in the browser. The G2 is noticeably faster opening tabs and loading pages. It is also smoother when zooming in and out of web pages. As far as games are concerned I have not run many graphic intensive games. I do play a lot of Temple Run (my favorite game) and it runs with no problems.\n\n2. Battery life is often times the biggest weakness that a smart phone can have. That is not the case with the G2. Battery life is simply outstanding. I find it almost impossible to drain the battery with normal use in one day. For example, having use the phone for 14 hours today listening to podcasts and music, talking for about an hour, sending over 50 text messages and watching Netflix the battery is still at 60% before going to sleep. By the way, the screen brightness was at 75%. I absolutely hated having to always have to dim the screen in the S3 to have the battery last me a whole day. The only thing that takes a considerably amount of battery is the GPS. An hour using the GPS with full brightness will use about 25% of the battery. Not a big deal if you have a car charger though. Speaking of charging, this phone charges from 0-100% in two hours. Not bad at all for such a big battery.\n\n3. One of the most advertised aspects of this phone is its big beautiful display. There is no denying it is gorgeous. Absolutely great if you want to watch videos and pictures. Reading on the phone is comfortable. Colors are considerably toned down from the AMOLED displays on Samsung phones. The pixel count in the display is through the roof making texts incredibly sharp. I have not had any problems with burn in or flickering on the screen. Nothing more to say here, the screen is awesome.\n\n4. The camera of the phone is excellent by cell phone standards. There is no way it is going to replace a DSLR camera but it can replace a regular point and shoot. I have not used my regular point and shoot camera in the last two years. The LG G2 takes excellent pictures during the day and decent pictures at night. The pictures come out looking much better at night if you use the night mode on the camera app. But that can be a hassle when you are trying to take a picture quickly. LG has marketed OIS capabilities of the camera. Honestly, I see this having the biggest difference when I am taking videos. The videos definitely look less shaky than the ones in my S3. When it comes to taking pictures however I don't think it really does much though. If I am not careful I still get the occasional blurry picture.\n\n5. The phone comes with 32 GB of memory. You can only use about 24 GB out of the box. After installing all my apps, music, taking a ton of picture and videos I still have 12 GB left. The storage is not a problem in my opinion. It is a good thing the base configuration of the phone comes with 32 GB and not 16 GB.\n\n6. I got used to the buttons being on the back of the phone after a few hours. It just becomes second nature after that. I actually find the position really comfortable now. I laugh whenever somebody tries to turn on my phone and they spend half a minute trying to figure out how to turn it on. If you are hesitating on this phone because of the back buttons DON'T. They are really no big deal. You might actually like it after a while. Even if you still don't like the buttons on the back you can always use the knock knock feature. That way you don't even have to use them if you don't want to.\n\nCons (continuation)\n\n1. The bad thing that comes with having such a big phone is that it makes it pretty difficult to use with one hand. It can get annoying when you are driving and trying to change a song quickly on the phone. I have small hands for a guy but they are not exactly tiny either. The phone itself is pretty thin and it definitely packs the biggest screen possible with the space it has. The borders are very small. Just keep in mind it is still a huge phone, not much smaller than the Samsung Galaxy Note 2. That is great for watching movies but a real pain in the behind if you like using the phone with one hand.\n\n2. Having use the G2 the last few months you can definitely tell that the LG software team is not up to par with its hardware. I have experienced a few bugs while using the phone. None of them a huge deal but annoying nonetheless. For example, the knock knock feature should be more like knock knock knock knock. You definitely have to tap more than once to get it to work at times. Also when the knock knock feature is On and I am going to put the phone in my pocket or lay it on a table the phone turns On for no apparent reason. The problem goes away if I turn the knock feature off. But by far the most annoying bug I have had has been with the messenger application. I have had to completely turn the notifications for text messages off. The phone will not turn off the screen if I have the notifications On. It happens with every single text message application on the market which makes me think it is a bug in the operating system itself and how it is handling these notifications.\n\n3. This phone has no removable battery or micro SD slot. Not that big of a deal for me but I know many people care about it. It might be a problem in a couple of years if the battery starts giving me any problems and I need to replace it. By that time I figure I have gotten a new phone though.\n\n4. I have tried the quick remote feature a few times now. It works with all my TVs and DVDs on my house. The set up was simple enough. The problem is that it just doesnt have nearly enough range and you have to point exactly straight at the device you are trying to operate. Often times it doesnt receive the command and you have to press it again, again, and again. Very irritating. It is definitely a feature I see using in case of emergency only if I ever lose or break the other remote controls. It is a real shame though because I can see how useful it is to have all your remotes in one.\n\n5. When you first get the phone it comes with the LG stock launcher. It is not bad but it is not nearly as good as some other launchers you see on the Play Store. The Nova Prime launcher has less clutter while having more features and customizations. There are no swipe shortcuts in the LG launcher, which is one of the reasons I like Nova Prime so much. The LG launcher is very similar to the Samsung Touchwiz in a lot of ways. When you swipe down the notification panel it has toggles for rotation, wifi, data, Bluetooth, GPS, airplane mode, quick remote, NFC and more. It also has volume and a brightness slide bar so you can adjust them. All of these features in the notification area are very useful but it would be very nice if you could have the option to take them away. You cant take them away which makes the notification feel cramped and cluttered.\n\n6. The final problem with the phone is that just like with a lot of phones a protective case is a must. The phone is fragile and it will definitely break if you drop it. Not only that, it is also fingerprint magnet. I had my phone two days before deciding it was a mistake to have it without a cover. The phone looks disgusting without a case. You can see the fingerprints from a mile away. The phone feels slippery without a case too. I ended up purchasing the Incipio Dual Pro case. It gives the phone a much better grip and minimizes fingerprints. It also offers very good protection while keeping the phone pretty slim. I highly recommend it.\n\nIn conclusion, do I recommend this phone? I sure do. Overall, the phone is a fantastic devise. It is fast, has a nice screen and it takes good pictures and videos. The battery lasts all day which is a big plus in my opinion. Unfortunately I cannot it give 5 out of 5 because of all the cons I mentioned above. The biggest problem being the software bugs it has. To be fair though I don't think there is a single phone in the market that is worth 5 out of 5 stars. There just isnt. There is a lot of pretty impressive competition but you will always find fault with a product if you really want to look at it with an objective view. I really hope this review helped you decide whether this phone is right for you. If you are in the market for a new phone keep an open mind and go to the store to try different phones. There are other options besides Apple and Samsung phones and the LG G2 is certainly worthy competition.", "summary": "Great phone with a few flaws", "unixReviewTime": 1389916800}

I just received this case for my iPhone 6 and I there are a couple differences, but overall I still really like it.  It is more streamlined than the one for the iPhone 5 and I think that tiny detail makes it a little more difficult to slide the back part open.  I don't want it to be easy to open by any means, but that is why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5.  If my thumbs or fingers are slick, then it makes it a little harder to open it so I have had to put my fingernail in the groove to push it open.  I wish there was a piece of rubber or something for my fingers to grab on to to help me open it.

On top of that great deal, I am going to send my phone to Nokia Trade Up For Cash program, which means overall I have spent $200 on this really cool phone.\n\nI had Nokias my whole cell phone history and last year got a Motorola. I really did like my Z9 but it was almost obsolete from day 1 (but I really don't have anything bad to say about it, it was a good phone.) I missed Nokia with their simple menus and excellent quality.\n\nTo be honest, the menus are no longer simple and sometimes seem counterintuitive LOL. And the touchscreen is a bit hard to use with the fingers like touching an iPhone (I have an iPod Touch so I was waffling between this phone and the iPhone). The touchscreen works very well with the included styli though. And my learning curve is getting better with touch, so I don't see it being a problem after a while. I think the accelerometer is faster than my Touch, almost too quick sometimes. The Music Player is the bomb! Way louder than my Touch and perfect clarity. It sounds amazing. I don't even need an additional speaker like I need for my Touch.\n\nThe screen is gorgeous and so far setting up everything has gone well. I have my music transferred, my contacts transferred and am very happy. I like the compact size and heft of the phone. I don't like lightweight feeling phones. The camera seems fine to me. The battery life does seem to be on the shorter side but make sure you close web applications after use. The phone does so much that you can dejuice it quickly. My Touch does the same thing.\n\nNokia definitely needs to step up with apps and also get the Music Store available for the US! Also if you message the downloads to yourself it is a pain, so it is better to download on the phone direct from the store. The App selection bites though, but that's what my ipod is for. The thrill of app-ness dies down anyway, so it's not really a big deal, but not having music store access is just silly.\n\nOtherwise this phone is very competitive to iPhone. Being upgradeable with its memory is a definite plus and you can even have many memory cards since it's hot swappeable, technically that is unlimited memory. I love my Touch of course but I got an 8g and I'm maxed out with music and apps and now I can't do anything to it unless I get rid of stuff. That kinda bites. So the 5800 has a true edge there.\n\nI already had AT&T and it was no problem to pop my SIM card in the phone and move right along. I had everything except the TV out cord and the stand which it appears on the website that they do not sell that in the package anymore so that is more Amazon's fault for not upgrading the info, but I don't really need the stand or cord. The USB cord is entirely too short. The headset comes in 2 pieces with a piece that can control the music and phone, which is very nice. Of course the charger is included and is acceptable. It easily connected with my internet, easily paired with my bluetooth, and once I finally figured out how to transfer music from my ipod to it, there were no problems there.\n\nI am very pleased with this phone and would recommend it for people who want a quality touchscreen phone and not necessarily an iPhone.\n\nPS I LOL at 8g holding 6000 songs. Maybe 6000 ringtone sound bytes. 8g will net you between 600-800 average songs....", "summary": "happy to be back with Nokia", "unixReviewTime": 1256428800}

I was too afraid to try it under water as the last one of a different brand failed to even work at all under water.

As a result, I did not adjust the overall rating either up or down for the features or drawbacks that are unique to this case format. Here is a summary of some of the pros and cons of the case to consider.\n\nPROS\n=====================================\n+ Very little bulk is added to the phone by the case.\n+ The slot inside the flap can fit a few credit cards, ID and paper money.\n+ The magnet on the flap allows the case to remain closed and the magnet also holds the flap in place if you fold the flap behind the phone.\n+ After answering or placing a call the flap can be closed to continue the conversation. A small slit on the flap allows the sound of the receiver to come through.\n+ The phone easily slides into the case.\n\nCONS\n=====================================\n- Taking a picture with the rear-facing camera means leaving the front flap open. If there was a slit on the front flap to expose the rear facing camera then flipping the flap around the back of the phone would work very well.\n- The power and volume buttons are awkward to reach while in the case.\n- The phone is well protected when the folio is closed, but the phone is exposed if the folio is opened, which could lead to damage to the phone if it were dropped.\n- Ideally the flap on the folio would hold the phone in a horizontal upright position. Considering the larger format of the iPhone 6 it makes it an ideal option to consume multimedia, so it would be nice to have the folio case be able to support the phone in this position.\n\nOverall this is a great folio case with some drawbacks that depending on preference could place the star rating anywhere between a 3 to 4.", "summary": "Solid Folio Case w/ Some Drawbacks", "unixReviewTime": 1420934400}

You all know the specs.  It does come with a lot of loaded apps that take up plenty space.  I must say, you probably should find a case for it.  It seems a bit harder to handle than any other phone I've had, so I fumble with it a lot.  I think it's a fairly fragile phone.  It probably won't handle many small drops.  Also, I always seem to turn it on when simply grabbing it or pulling out of my pockets.  The buttons, on the side, are very sensitive.  It seems like a very capable phone, but I struggle with the arrangement of the power and volume buttons on the side.  Battery seems to need recharging 5-7 hours into the day with very little use. And, did I say, it has a lot of bloatware?  I am constantly killing apps in order to preserve battery life.  So much junk running in the background.\n\nI've been a Samsung fan for a long time. It all started with the Galaxy Player 5.  That was a great device during that period just before the true smartphone boom.  We have 3 Samsung LED TVs, two Galaxy 7inch tablets, a nearly 3.5 year old Galaxy Note 10.1 inch Tablet, a 10 in Galaxy Tab, and 9.7 inch Tab S2.

Masten", "reviewText": "20151101-I'll preface this by stating that the case is still very new to me, and it is the first rugged case I've put on this phone.  So I'll be back to update my impressions of this case in a few months.\n\nGenerally, I'd wait and put some miles on it before I reviewed it, but right out of the box I got a very strong impression of this case.  I've used rugged cases on every smartphone I've had; except my first, the HTC Merge, which was not a very aftermarket friendly phone.  Since I buy my phones outright, I'm well aware of their value and spend accordingly on their cases.  It's pretty much a compulsion with me; to keep trying till I find \"the one\".  So I've tried everything from a cheap, off-the-shelf Pelican to a hideously expensive Seidio Obex that I bought on Amazon.\n\nSimply taking it out of the packaging, it felt sturdier than anything I've had on any of my phones, except the Obex of course.  Indeed, the only case I've used that was more difficult to open up and get the phone into WAS the Obex.  But that's not necessarily a bad thing.  It seems like the harder they are to get open, the less they rely on the structure of your phone to maintain their shape in an impact, which translates to the case taking more punishment than the phone.  Just watch the installation video they have on YouTube, bring your patience, and you'll get through it.\n\nIntegrated screen protector-Was extremely well attached.  If any part of your purchasing decision involves that, I can definitely attest to how well it's fused to the case.  With designs that aren't \"water proof\" I typically provide a tempered glass screen protector and throw away any integrated ones; this is the first case I've done that to where I actually had to start a corner with a knife and slit the first inch along the edge before I could get a good enough hold to pull it out.  Its fused to the case like the one in the waterproof Obex.  Unfortunately, I can't speak to its quality beyond that, since the first thing I did was remove it.\n\nBeveling around the screen- Hands down my biggest pet peeve where rugged cases are concerned.  YES, I do appreciate that when the phone is lying face down, the glass is a good 1/8\" from the surface I've rested it on.  NO, I do not appreciate non-beveled edges that require two handed use, or a double-jointed thumb to drag an icon from one screen to the next.  The Obex and Otterbox Defenders were the worst, Obex had no beveling at all, 90 degrees to the glass; the Defender's bevels were so steep they could barely be considered an improvement.  This case is the only rugged case I've ever used where the edges are beveled so neatly that I can slide my thumb right up to the edge of the touch screen.\n\nEasily my favorite feature-big props to the engineering team that realized that not all thumbs are tiny and/or double-jointed!\n\nMaterials- Thick, very sturdy, very tight.  Feels more like an Obex than a Defender; although some genius put 6 little rubbery accents on the back that look cosmetic, but are very well placed for keeping the otherwise hard and not-tacky back of the case from sliding around on what you put it on.  I'm hoping that \"feels more like an Obex\" remains true over the long term, as the root of my dislike for the Defender lies in the silicon outer skin's tendency to get baggy and sloppy over time.  Given the way this case goes together, if it gets sloppy like the Otterbox, it'll become unusable.  Though...  considering how much less it costs than the Defender, I think I could live with replacing it if it lasts more than 6mo.\n\nBelt clip/holster- Definitely more Obex/Defender quality than Pelican; but time will tell.  It feels solid, the case engages the holster in a very solid and reassuring way, although unlike the Obex it doesn't have a positive lock that actually reaches over the phone and grabs the back.  It's more like the Defender, where the clip rests in a dimple.  This design is close to the Obex in that it doesn't use a dimple, but I'd definitely like to see more clip reach around the back of the case, even if it did require more force to get the phone out of the holster.\n\nSummary:  It's priced like a Pelican, but without the disappointment.  In my opinion it's competitive with Seidio's Obex and Otterbox's Defender, with tradeoffs.  It actually feels less like I've compromised for ruggedness than it does with either of those brands.  Of course, it's not waterproof like the Obex, but it doesn't mess with the sound or features of the phone either...  The only thing I feel you'd lose in going with this over Otterbox's Defender is the branding.", "summary": "Very polished design-Punches above its weight from a price perspective.", "unixReviewTime": 1446336000}

I had considered getting the Alcatel Onetouch Idol 3 like my wife did, but in the end I decided on the Asus Zenfone 2 Laser\n\nI was a little uneasy about getting this particular phone in the beginning. Many of the reviews were mixed and I was not sure that it would be worth the money I was going to spend on it (I can only afford budget phones). However when Amazon lowered the price by $30 which put it at $199, I pulled the trigger and hoped for the best. The 32 gig of storage and 3 gig of memory works very well for this phone. It is fast and it has not lagged yet even with 10 or more apps open at the same time. Battery life seems to be comparable to other phones and if I am not playing games on it, I can get all day out of it without a problem on one charge. It is a little bigger than I am used to but oddly enough it seems to work for me. While larger than my Moto G, it is much better performing in almost every aspect.\n\nThe notification light is not overly bright, unlike my Moto G which seem to be far too intense at night. The Zenfone allows you to turn it off if you would like but I leave it on for emails, texts and voicemails.  I could not turn it off completely on my Moto G.\n\nMy complaints are mostly minor.  The display is very weak in bright sunlight. The overall volume seems a little lower then my Moto G but it is still loud enough to hear even when it's in my pocket. The Zen UI is a little confusing at first. It is an acquired taste but once you get used to it it is not bad. Also the back, home, and recently used apps buttons at the bottom of the phone do not light up which is kind of a pain when you use your phone in the dark. To me this is a big design flaw. Of course most Android users know where the buttons are, but it would be nice to have them light up just a little bit.\n\nMy biggest complaint would have to be the amount bloatware installed that cannot be removed. I think I was able to remove 3 apps total. you can uninstall the updates and disable them but I am hesitant to do so because I do not know what effect they will have on the operation of the phone.\n\nEven with the large amount of bloatware installed, this phone does not lag at all. It has some great tweaking apps that allow you to clear the memory quickly which helps out if you have lots of apps open.

This battery can charge most Apple products which is great.\n\nPros:\n-Sleek design and light weight. Robust construction with a nice looking glossy front.\n-Two USB ports for charging (1A/2A) and a third 1A mini-USB. This means up to three charges at once.\n-The built in charging cord is a big plus.\n-It's a bit bigger than my iPhone. But smaller and lighter is always better.\n\nSuggestions/ Improvements:\n-I wish this included a bundle of short little charging cables for various devices so there is no need to lug around long charging cables.\n-I would prefer a more precise battery level indicator. Digital indicator could be even better, instead of the four LEDs on the unit or something that shows a percentage\n instead of just a simple colored blue light without meaning.\n-It would also be nice if a carrying case would be come with the unit.\n-It seems to get dirty very easily on its shiny gloss black finish. I would've preferred matte plastic.\n-Light indicators turn off while charging the devices and it is a little bit confusing it could be blinking in every few seconds instated of shutting off.\n\nAll in all, I love this product.

Only a few of them have hit the mark and this is one of them. Here is what I like about this car mount holder:\n\n- Extremely strong suction for the windshield phone mount which is important to be able to hold a heavy phone so it doesn't fall.\n- It works easily as a dashboard mount if you don't want to mount it on the windshield\n- Once mounted the car mount holder is fully adjustable. I can move it in any direction and adjust to my needs and it stays there.\n- Strong and durable. The clamps are strong enough to hold my Note 4 with ease but delicate enough to hold my wife's iphone 6\n\nI really don't have any cons for this suction mount universal car phone mount.

It obviously slides into the CD player slot of your car, and mine didn't have any problem with the head unit, as far as a CD thinking it was constantly being input or taken out.\nIt is sturdy, well build, and has a velvet soft back and sides to clasp your phone. My phone has the volume rockers on the side so I had to angle it \"just so\" that it wouldn't keep hitting the volume keys when I locked it into place. This was not an issue if I put it in landscape mode instead of portrait, but I didn't always want my phone that way. All the other reviews will answer your questions about the placement of the device, the build quality, and orientations/phones you can use with this. I want to address one thing that I either never thought of when I bought this, or it was never brought to my attention. For this to be stable it works like this, put your hands together like you just clapped them (prayer hands), palms and fingers flat. Now, while keeping your palms together, open your hands into a \"V\". This is the basic mechanics of the mount. It has grooves on the backside where it fits into your CD slot that open both ways when you apply the screw at the bottom. Obvious right? Well what didn't occur to me and may not occur to you, is this could damage your CD players input area. I had an aftermarket kenwood DVD player and once I applied enough pressure to make it stable, the top input area was visibly bowed outward. At first I was a little bothered but then figured what the heck, I don't use it anyway. A friend of mine gave me a new mix to listen to so I threw it in the DVD player, jacked it completely up, the disc not my player thank God. If you look in your input area on your CD/DVD player, there is a small felt or fibrous looking area that keeps debris out of your lasers eye. The use of this mount had pushed that material off it's \"track\" and was mostly inside my DVD player. They use some kind of industrial adhesive to keep it in place and so most of this had come off onto the disc. I was unable to reapply the input debris cover, and ended up getting rid of the player anyway (not because of this) but after that incident I didn't use it again. Now I have a bluetooth connection and just leave my phone in my pocket.\nWith this story told, just be aware of what you are purchasing, and how it works. This rating is NOT for the product itself, it works EXACTLY as advertised, and is well crafted, as for the starts, it literally means that I just thought it was \"okay\" for me.

For  Example for a single USB Port  :\n(Non QC) Charger Output Voltage  : 5V  ,  Max Power : >10 W\nQC 3.0 Output Voltage  : 3.2v - 20v dynamic  ,  Max Power : 18W\n\nSo the Quick Charge technology not only requires the internal components to withstand the stresses of higher power levels but also strikes a very fine and delicate balance between practicality of faster charge times and the service life of your phone's battery. This is because charging a battery rapidly generates a lot of  heat and heat is bad for your battery's life. A Qualcomm certification ensures that your phone's battery is being charged at the fastest possible speeds without potentially damaging it. I would never trust my $700 phone with anything that has a remote chance of damaging its battery , Would you?\n\nPros\n- Qualcomm Certified means it has been tested thoroughly and safer for your phones\n- Two full speed QC 3.0 Ports which charge both the Samsung Galaxy S6's (QC 2.0 Compatible )  in my household very fast. About 59% in 30 mins which is right on the QC2.0 benchmark\n- Despite being a fairly large charger, its designed practically - It does not block adjacent ports on your wall or Surge strips due to its slim profile\n- Comes with a premium 20AWG charging Mirco USB cable\n- 24 Month Warranty (most other brands offer only 12 or 18 Months)\n\nCons\n- About the only thing i missed in this charger was a charging/power indicator light\n\nOverall I really like the Aukey Dual Port QC 3.0 charger and highly recommend to you if you have more than one Quick Charge compatible device in your home.

Troutman", "reviewText": "I have to say this is the my favorite case from otterbox I've owned. I have owned both the commuter and defender for my iPhone 5. The commuter was hard to get on and fit correctly but was a decent case providing good protection without turning your phone into a brick. The defender was a beast of a case but the plastic screen shield would degrade the screen clarity slightly and the open ear peice would allow dust to enter the case and get beneath it forcing you to take it apart and clean it if that kind of thing bothers you. For me it did I can't stand anything that takes away from my retina display. I decided to try the symmetry for my new iPhone 6 and I'm glad I did. This case gives two layers of protection in one single peice. Hard plastic and semihard rubber are blended together perfectly. Similar to the way a spec candyshell case is made but the rubber seems slightly better and less suseptible to peeling. If you have ever owned one you know what I mean. The plastic is a nice non reflective matte finish that feels high quality. Has a very nice raised edge around the face that's not too thick that it takes away from swiping up and down for notifications. This case is relatively thin for the amount of protection it provides. I would recommend a screen protector because this case does not come with one. The edges do cover the rounded edge of your glass screen so get a protecter that gives plenty of clearence or the case may peel the edges if it comes in contact with them. A glass screen protector would be perfect. All in all I am very impressed!", "summary": "Wow Otterbox!", "unixReviewTime": 1419292800}

Swearingen", "reviewText": "I wanted this battery for games like geocaching or Ingress.  At first I was worried about the brand as I'd never heard of Limefuel.  But I found positive reviews for their other products so I figured it was a good price.  I am indeed happy with this product.  The case is a little hard to get onto my phone.  But that's minor.  I ran the battery to 0% and then plugged the phone in to time a full charge.  It took about 4.5 hours.  After that I had a fun night out with friends playing Ingress.  After 7 straight hours of very heavy continuous use of the GPS, LTE data and screen; the battery registered that it still had 49% charge.  That is excellent in my opinion.\n\nIt should be plain to people that this battery is heavy.  After all it is 4x bigger than the stock battery.  It didn't take long to get used to the weight though and when I switched back to the stock battery my phone felt feather light.  Downsides of the battery and case are that the speaker is heavily muffled.  You're going to need to crank the volume just to hear ringtones and/or notifications.  It is also a little difficult to get my finger in to open the battery plug cover to plug in the phone.\n\nI would not use this battery for my normal daily use.  I use my phone for tracking my runs and playing music on said runs.  This battery is far too big and heavy for such a use unless I had some sort of sling to hold the phone.  All that aside I would definitely recommend this battery if you're going to need to use your S5 for an extended period away from an available charger.  I imagine it will be much appreciated on my next flight as well.", "summary": "Great for geocaching and hiking!", "unixReviewTime": 1426291200}

Gamboa", "reviewText": "This review is for the CellEver Note 4 Premium Leather Wallet Case [Flip Folio Cover] with Kickstand and Pockets. The case arrived on time and packaging was very minimal.\n\nOverall the case is well made and the materials used appear to be high quality. My favorite features are the card slots (obviously) and the magnetic closing strap. There is no snap closure here! I only wish this it was magnetic to stay open to the back of the case (for when you want it out of the way).\n\nThe case also does not interfere with tempered glass screen protectors and the surrounding TPU protects the phones perimeter and buttons really well. It is not like other phones that leave the top, bottom and buttons exposed. Buttons are still easily pressed and all ports and microphone openings are perfect and centered.\n\nMy only negative and reason why I will take 1 star away is because the card pockets go all the way down. If you push a card too far down you will have to try to fish it out. The problem is magnified if this happens to you on the very top pocket and your card goes all the way down. They should have sewn the pockets card size for this not to happen.\n\nVerdict: 4-stars! At $9.99 this a Good Buy. Just fix the pockets issue and possibly add a magnet to the back of the case for strap to stick to it and it becomes a Great Buy.\n\nHow my Ratings Work:\n1 Star = Awful. Complete junk. Do not buy. Stay far away.\n2 Stars = Not good at all, but there are a few redeeming qualities...\n3 Stars = It's okay. It's not terrible, but I'm not thrilled with it either.\n4 Stars = Fantastic! I love it, but there are a few things that could improve.\n5 Stars = This product is wonderful in every way. Buy it! Re-buy it! Worship it!!!\n\n*If at any time my opinion on this product changes, I will update my review to reflect that.\n**This product was received either at no or low cost for review, inspection and testing purposes.

I ordered it in the silver color, which is actually a nice soft silver tone.  I was really happy that there was no odor, which on some items I've purchased that come from outside the US have really strong odors.  But no odor with this purse.  The material is very soft and the workmanship is great!\n\nThis purse is really cute.  It easily holds my phone in the main area with the magnetic snap, along with some makeup and a few extra items.  The little zipper pocket on the front is great for a small set of keys.  It is very comfortable to carry.  Just the right size for going out, when I don't want to lug my big huge purse around.  This is a great quality purse at a great price.  I would definitely recommend this.\n\nThere was an additional little bonus that came with it that I was not expecting.  It is just a little rubber attachment that you can stick to the back of your phone to prop it up.  I already have this type of feature on my phone case, so I don't need that, but it was a nice added bonus.\n\nLike most online shoppers, I read through reviews posted by others to determine whether I want to try out a product. I always do what I can to help by describing my purchases honestly. If I have been helpful please check yes, that it was helpful to you and I will do the same for all of the helpful reviews I find!

The volume button is covered on the upper/high volume portion, thus keeping pressure on the high volume button.  Even though I don't use the Peel app and the IR, it's completely covered as well.  The bottom speakers aren't aligned correctly. And lastly, the light sensor is completely covered also, so if auto brightness is on, will always dim the screen to adjust to low light situations.\n\nAgain, this case would be excellent for the original Galaxy Tab 7 first generation, BUT NOT FOR THE GALAXY TAB 2 7.0", "summary": "Nice case, Not for the Tab 2 7.0\"s", "unixReviewTime": 1335312000}

I have had several Seidio cases in the past and this feels similar to them. The kickstand seems to be improved over previous models and does not stick out as far as the 5s model. Also, the kickstand is magnetized which adds a nice touch. Unfortunately the button cutouts on this model are absolutely rubbish. Too much of the phone is exposed for too little/difficult access of the buttons. It just doesn't seem well thought out and you'd think someone along the line would come up with a better option.\n\nMy Pros/Cons list for this case:\n\nPros:\n- Looks and feels very nice, feeling only gets better with time in my opinion\n- The kickstand is improved over previous versions and I might actually use it more often! Though still a little weak, so long as you take even a modicum of care while opening it, you should be fine.\n- The squared off sides and bottom are preferred for me, the way I hold the phone (especially when texting, etc) the squared off bottom is ideal for me!\n\nCons:\n- The buttons are much more difficult to use in this case - This is a big one for me, you have to get your finger in JUST right to hit them, usually putting the phone off balance in the hand. A case is supposed to protect from drops, not cause them.\n- The openings on the bottom could cause issues with some headphones and lightning cables. My Bose headphones BARELY fit. The Apple lightning cable fits fine but others probably will not.\n- Straight out of the box the case is quite slick. If you have perpetually dry hands like I do this case is slippery. Not quite as slippery as the iPhone 6 itself, but slippery nonetheless. When fiddling with a colleague's case (who's had it a couple of months), this slickness seems to dissipate.\n- Slide-on cases scare me. It's probably just me being paranoid, but even the tiniest speck of dirt inside a slider case would make the phone prone to scratching. Slider cases have always scared me for this one reason. Seidio seems to have helped by adding a soft lining to the case.\n\nOverall this case is okay. It's been added to my case repertoire, and we'll see in the future how often and in what situations it's used.", "summary": "Good case but a couple of issues.", "unixReviewTime": 1433548800}

There is no rubberized finish, rather it is all hard plastic.  Thats not necessarily a bad thing.  The case is sized perfectly for the Samsung S3.  Hard to believe it is an old phone now.  I remember waiting eagerly for it to be available in my area.\n\nWith the phone in the hard case, it is a little hard to slide out of the part that attaches to a belt.  The tight fit makes it secure.  The belt clip half has a velvet-type finish on the inside to protect the screen as the phone is inserted and removed.  I tried to show that feature in one of the pictures below.\n\nThe clip convents to a kick stand.  On the back of the phone case, there is a built-in kick stand, but it is so difficult to pull out, I don't expect to use it much.  Ive included a photograph of the two parts with their kick stands.  The phone is shown in a most upright position, but in practice I would likely only using in the more prone position because it is not very stable standing tall.  The belt clip/kick stand rotates so that it can be attached or viewed in either landscape or portrait modes.\n\nI wanted a case that would allow me to carry my phone without putting in a pocket.

It's kind of like having one of those long wallets you see men carrying, or even maybe like a lady's wallet she would keep in her purse. It's definitely a good size, and your phone slides in easily. At first it took some shaking to get it out because it was a little snug, but after some use it loosened up and now it comes in and out nice and smooth. The outside of the case has a little slot for a drivers license, business cards, credit cards, or things of that sort. I wouldn't say you could get much more than three or four cards in there along with the phone. If you were to go without the phone, you could even use the whole thing as a wallet. I wear mine on my hip pocket and am yet to find a way to get the phone out without taking the whole thing off my pocket and flipping it upside down to get the phone out of it. This would be considered a con to most people, but I look at it as I'm either doing that or I'm reaching into my pocket to dig it out anyway. To me, it's technically the same but this way I don't have to worry about my keys scratching the screen or any loose pocket change. The case does feel like a nice leather, it's not one where you would pick it up and think \"this is cheaply made\", this feels good in the hand and the material inside the pouch kind of helps clean a little bit of the fingerprints off the screen taking it in and out of the pouch. Not a whole lot, but a little.

It really helps to have a screen protector where I'm still able to use the screen and go about on my day to day activities.

McDougall", "reviewText": "EDIT:\nI installed the Marshmallow update several weeks ago, and I've had zero problems with the phone since. It seems to have solved my Bluetooth issues; if anything it's now TOO persistent - the Zenfone Laser won't allow my LG G4 to connect to audio in my car if it's still on. So, install the Marshmallow update, and you'll have a really good, 4 star mid-range phone. Overall, I'm glad I bought it, it's still not quite as good as my LG G4 overall but I paid half as much for it - IMO it's worth more than that.\n\nOriginal Review:\nI got the unlocked 32gb Zenphone 2 Laser with 3gb memory. I wanted a dual SIM solution because T-Mobile has service at my work and AT&T has service everywhere else; unfortunately it's not a seamless solution because of T-Mobiles weird restrictions (no call forwarding? In 2016?). Unfortunately the phone is also crippled by Bluetooth connection problems so severe I've been forced to relegate it to work-only duty; if you want to use car BT connections routinely you will have to look elsewhere.\n\nPros:\n- Screen is bright, clear. Honestly, can't tell it's not 1080p.\n- reasonably fast and responsive (3 gb memory version). Plays games like zombies v. plants without a hitch.\n- works well with AT&T, T-Mobile.\n- memory card slot accepted 128gb card without a hiccup.\n- camera is ok, not near as good as my LG G4 but much better than my old iphone 5 and Nexus 4. Nice features in the Zen camera app like HDR and manual controls.\n- ZenUI interface not bad, quite usable, fairly light skinning.\n- suite of Zen software has some useful tools, easy to disable.\n- marshmallow update available (but reported to be buggy, so haven't installed it yet).\n- battery lasts all day with light-moderate use.\n\nCons:\n- Bluetooth issues - read around on Reddit about ongoing BT problems with Zenphones. Not a good choice if car BT is essential to you. In one car I own I have to stop and restart BT on the phone to get it to connect (sometimes, not consistently; drops off and on); in the other vehicle I have to turn the whole car off and on.... don't get me started on my BT speaker....\n- the replaceable battery is only available as a kit with a charger directly from ASUS; no battery-only or aftermarket battery solutions. So pricey, and with extra baggage.\n- speaker is ok but earphone volume is low, usually have to keep it on max volume - but I can listen at 50% on most other phones.\n- no Qualcomm quickcharge, takes several hours to recharge from empty with a 2.1A charger.\n- gets quite warm with GPS use and when streaming music, not as bad as iphone 5 or Nexus 4 but much worse than LG G4.\n- several minor niggles that are mostly me; I don't like the full-time capacitive touch buttons (not upgradeable) or the lack of NFC.\n\nOverall, not a bad phone, but BT issues are a serious problem that could possibly be remedied with a software update; I have no idea why they haven't fixed it yet. I haven't heard they are fixed in Marshmallow; once it's stable I will find out.", "summary": "Close to excellent - they solved the Bluetooth problems with Marshmallow update.", "unixReviewTime": 1469923200}

The other two ports on the wall charger output 5 VDC at 1 Amp and that is ideal for charging your smart phones.\n\nThe unit has flip out AC wall charger plugs and that is a nice feature if you toss this into a backpack, computer bag, carry-on luggage or just pack it away in a bag or briefcase.  In my video I show it charging four items at one time and it worked perfectly while outputting over 5 amps.  The unit has a max output of 6 amps.  I was charging:\n* Two iPhone 5S units at 1 Amp each\n* An iPad Air at 2.04 Amps\n* A Samsung Tab 4 at .95 Amps\n\nThe unit will operate on 100 to 240 VAC and 50/60 HZ. It is surge protected to protect it and your devices that are charging.  The unit has an LED that is blue and it is on when the unit is plugged into the wall.  It is very dim and that is good for me as I don't like bright LEDs in the hotel bedroom or in my bedroom at night.\n\nMy only minor complaint is that the unit when plugged in covers enough of the other AC wall outlet that you cannot use the other AC wall power outlet.  That means you are using one and losing one and in a hotel room that sometimes can be a problem.  I still liked the unit a lot and I rated it at 5 stars.  I particularly liked the ability to output 2.4 amps for my iPad Air and the ability to charge 4 items.\n\nI was supplied a sample for test and evaluation.

The fit, this case fits perfectly and seems like its made out of high quality TPU, will update later on to let you know if the case turns yellow like cheap TPU clear cases.\n2. The snug and slim fit, the case is not only perfectly made to fit the Note 3 but its also very slim, much slimmer than my previous dyztronic case. Take note that its probably not very good to absorb shock, but I take care of my devices very well so I just wanted the protection for the small scratches and scuffs.

After reading many reviews, watching you tube video reviews and unboxings, I decided on the HTC On. The phones I were debating on were the HTC, Samsung Galaxy S4, and iPhone 5S. And, ultimately I was sold on the HTC One.\n\nThe good:\n1. Build quality. The phone is solid. Made of aluminum and glass, with zero gap construction. There is no creaking or other signs of sub-par construction.\n\n2. The display. The lcd screen produces a beautiful picture with dark darks and bright whites. The display is great.\n\n3. Sound. The much talked about Boom Sound front facing speakers are something that must be experienced. I used to use my headphones to watch You Tube videos even when I was alone and there wasn't a chance of disturbing others. Now I use the sound through the speakers. The sound is phenomenal!\n\n4. HTC Zoe. I won't get to much into this because there is a lot to do in this feature. But, I will say that the built in feature allows the user to create 30 second videos with sound and editing at the push of a button. The end product is totally shareable directly after creation.\n\n5. Speed, storage and battery. The processor being used makes the phone very speedy. There is practically no lag. Switching between screens and tasks is fluid and smooth. The phone has 32gigs of storage which is more than enough for me. I have to say that I don't use my phone as a music player so I don't fill it up with music.  Battery life has been pretty good after I got over the honeymoon stage of always using my phone. I do consider myself a power user, minus gaming, and I get through a twelve hour work day without charging.\n\n6. Size. I believe that HTC has found the \"sweet spot\" with the size of this phone. Coming from the Samsung Galaxy S3, which I found to be a good size if not a little wide, I think the HTC being a little taller and thinner is a better form factor.  And I feel the size of the screen is better than the more petite iPhone 5S.\n\nAnd now the Bad;\n\n1. The camera. I mentioned HTC Zoe as a great feature, but the camera used for this feature is kind of bad. The auto focus is spotty and the clarity of the pictures are also hit or miss. I have found that I can stand in the same spot and take the same pictures and get widely varying results. At this price point and quality of product, the camera should be much better.\n\n2. The aluminum body. Here we go again. I know I said the build quality is a plus, and it is a solid feeling phone. I prefer plastic because in my experience while plastic will often scratch when dropped,  aluminum will dent. I think scratches are easier to live with than dents.\n\nAnd that's it. As you can see. The plusses far out weigh the minuses. Of the two cons the camera is the one that is find to be the most egregious. The competitors at this price point are putting far superior cameras in their products. My wifes iPhone 5S produces pictures that blow the HTC out of the water.\n\nBut overall the phone is probably the best smartphone available. I have had the chance to work with the iPhone 5S and the new Samsung Note 3, and i am still sold on the HTC One. And there are rumors of software updates that may help with the camera.\n\nI would give the HTC One 4 1/2 stars. Minus 1/2 for the camera.", "summary": "As good as it gets.", "unixReviewTime": 1384214400}

Features are one thing, but a good customizable user experience is another.  That's probably why in the early Android years I kept going back to the iPhone...but I digress.\n\nAs the years passed, I got increasingly tired of carrying around (and packing) a phone, a tablet and (or) an e-reader.  Most phones have just about enough power to last a full day, a tablet is good (with intermittent usage) for a few days; and most e-readers last about 3 weeks to a month.\n\nWho this phone IS for: A person looking to simplify their life with one device.\n\nHere's why:\n1. A huge display: 6.1 inches!  (This easily replaces a 7-10\" tablet) even if the display resolution is HD 720 x 1280 it's bright and great for reading and watching movies.\n2. Battery life: 3900 mAh battery.  With normal daily usage (reading emails, text messages, social media, and news feeds) I average about 3 days between charges. (That replaces the e-reader) and now images and illustrations in my ebooks are in color!\n3. Storage: The micro SD card slot can support up to 128GB!  That's a lot of music, movies or travel pics.\n\nWho this phone is NOT for: Power gamers, skinny-jean wearing hipsters, or folks looking to shoot award-winning Instagram pics.  The camera is great as far as I'm concerned.  I use it for capturing family memories and documenting stuff I take apart & repair.\n\nHope that helps make your purchasing decision a little easier.", "summary": "A year later and I still love this phone!", "unixReviewTime": 1469923200}

I am still very happy with it and otherwise it has stood the test of serious use. I also write it while doing the demolition on my sun porch to completely gut it and remove all the old windows, and the entire renovation to frame in new walls. It emerged without a scratch and only the paint splatter shows on it\n\nI am ordering another and I hope they make one for the pebble 2 which i just backed on kickstarter, I would order one as soon as I get my new Pebble\n\nThis wrap makes my old black pebble look great. It went on very easy and has lasted now over three (now six!) months of every day use. I wear my pebble 24/7 and the wrap still looks like the day I put it on.

I think it's a nice touch that if you look closely at the leds they're actually labeled \"full,\" etc.\n\nFor the last week I've used the IMP100P as my primary charger for my Nexus 7 and Samsung Galaxy S3. With the two usb ports I was able to charge both devices at the same time. Charging is quick, even when using both usb ports simultaneously. The unit is more reliable than charging via the cigarette lighter in my car.\n\nMy only issue with this device is the special cable required to charge it. It's frustrating to have to carry a proprietary cable that isn't good for anything other than charging the IMP. This device would be near perfect if it allowed charging via micro sub like most other modern electronics. Then with a single cable you could charge your phone, charge the IMP, and charge the phone from the IMP.\n\nI also continue to hope that New Trent will make a \"tough\" edition of one of their chargers.

I just figured out today several months later that I got a fake.\n\nIts a really good fake, but the big give away is the lack of a water indicator sticker on top of the battery.\n\nIf you don't have that little water indicator sticker that they use to void the warranty if you drop it in water, then its not real. The sticker is on the top of the battery next to the charging pins. No pink and white XXX sticker (or all white apparently), then you got a fake too.\n\nSo my battery says EB-BG900BBE 2800 mAh on the back.\nS/N: AA1F411HS/2-B\n\nAlso, I didn't get the wall charger or cable that supposedly come in the box with the fake one, the real one has the wall charger.  See photos.\n\nI bought this from Amazon and fulfilled by Amazon Prime so you would expect that I would have gotten the real thing.\n\nNope! Got a fake, granted its a really nice looking fake but the battery doesn't last nearly as long.\n\nI informed Amazon, lets see if they do anything about it.\n\nUpdate #1: Amazon is sending me a replacement battery kit in exchange for the counterfeit one. They were really cool about everything even though it was out of the return period.\n\nUpdate #2: The replacement arrived from Amazon and it looks just like the first kit. Came in one box and there is no hologram on the box. Also the box is not large enough to hold a wall charger so I am assuming its not in there. I didn't open the replacement box because there wasn't much point. It was the same.\n\nUpdate #3: After speaking with a customer service representative at Amazon, they gave me a return label for both battery kits and I sent them back. I have also gotten a credit on my card for the purchase.\n\nI went ahead and ordered the kit direct from Samsung. Comparing the two they are so extremely close in just about every way in appearance. I am rather surprised how good the fake ones look. The replacement battery has the little white water detection sticker, the fake one does not.\n\nAlso, the official kit comes with a little black wall charger so you can charge your phone and the battery pack at the same time. Honestly, other than the lack of a water damage indicator sticker on the battery and the lack of a wall charger, I honestly don't think I would have noticed. Boxes were completely different though, so double check it before you buy it.\n\nThe fake battery swelled up after a few months and the case wouldn't fit on the phone with it anymore.\n\nHere is the link direct to Samsung. http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/cell-phones-accessories/EB-KG900BWUSTA\n\nAttached are some photos.  In all the photos the real thing is on the LEFT, fake battery kit is on the RIGHT.\n\nAlso, I took a picture of everything included in the real kit.\n\nJust look at the pictures of the boxes and you will know if you have a real one or not.

The speaker offers up lots of options to make it very personal and can go just about anywhere.  The sound is really great and impressive for the size.\n\n The speaker features buttons for Volume +/-, Skip forward/backward, Play/pause, and a multi-function button.  There are three main ways to use this device for music: using an optional Micro-SD card pre-loaded with music, Bluetooth connection, or for music players that don't feature Bluetooth, a 3.5mm AUX-in port.  The micro-SD card route is perfect if you intend to use this with a bike.  It is important to note here that the speaker is not designed for call answering as it does not feature a microphone.\n\n The package has all the accessories one could possibly need and you are all setup out of the box.  Included in the box: the Joyiqi Bluetooth speaker, four skins (black, blue, red, green), an optional wrist strap, four color matching rubber straps for attaching the speaker to a pole or bike handle, one USB charging cable, and a 3.5mm AUX connection cable.\n\n The Joyiqi performs very well and does an excellent job reproducing music.  In the video, I play some music from the YouTube Audio Library (royalty/copyright-free) which will help you get a better feel for what this speaker sounds like.  The bass on this unit is very respectable.  The speaker is ultra-portable and the added ability to customize its look is very cool.\n\n Generally, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Joyiqi-Portable-Rechargeable-Wireless-Bluetooth-Speaker/dp/B00JTU88Y2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Joyiqi Portable Rechargeable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker</a>&nbsp;is a great performer and delivers lots of options for use for the end user.\n\n[Sample Provided For Review]", "summary": "Really Nice Portable Speaker With Lots Of Customization Options...", "unixReviewTime": 1401235200}

Having a power switch is a very valuable addition to prevent your battery from draining if you don't ride your bike for extended periods.\n\nNotably, I bought this after buying two Battery Tender SAE to USB adapters (http://www.amazon.com/Battery-Tender-081-0158-Disconnect-Charger/dp/B00DJ5KEF4/), each of which failed after just a couple of weeks. Let's hope that this lasts for longer. I'll post an update after I've lived with it for a while. To make a clean-looking installation, I simply used black wire ties to a nearby cable.\n\nBy the way: you should NEVER connect any devices to your bike battery without a fuse in the line. This product on Amazon (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NCOKZQ) is a good choice.\n\n========\n\nUPDATE (as promised). I really wanted this work, but it failed after two weeks of use - no better than the BatteryTender. No power is delivered to the USB port anymore.

The Sview functionality works perfect! (I'm still on 4.3 with Verizon, can't speak to 4.4 update).  The case feels phenomenal.. great in the hand, nice soft leather... Not a huge fan of the colored stripe and logo up front, but I can live with it.  Bottom line for me is that this is my new day to day case.  I'm very pleased!

Possibly a little overkill for day to day use, but I anticipate eventually using it for going camping as well, where the longevity of the charge will come in handy. I say that it's overkill for day to day given that it's a 22000mAh battery, and that it's pretty weighty to keep in a purse or backpack. However, many a time myself or my friends have had dying phones and I've been able to come to the rescue. It's also very durable, as I had it with me one night going out with friends and managed to drop it on the sidewalk. It only sustained a small chip in the plastic on the outside and still performs magnificently. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a really durable and long lasting charge with your portable battery. Otherwise, if you don't think you'll wind up needing the longevity of the battery charge and don't want to deal with the weight on a daily basis, I would recommend going with a smaller and lighter model, which may need more frequent re-charging, but won't be as cumbersome to lug around.", "summary": "Great charger!", "unixReviewTime": 1479168000}

At first after opening it I thought it was broken because the stand wouldn't move, but then I looked at the directions and you just press in on one of the circles on the top of the side and the easel/stand moves freely and as soon as you let go of pressing on the plastic circle at the top it stops moving and locks in place.  So you really could make this stand stand at any angle you'd like it to -- it doesn't click or have preset specific angles it can stand at, it is smoothly and freely adjustable.

The cheaper ones looked like I was getting what I was paying for with squared off edges and a giant logo across the front of some.\n\nMy original intent was to use this as a fill light for product photography on my phone. Its ok for that. Its kind of a glaring light so consider using the low or medium brightness to keep from blowing out brighter spots. For selfies, it was nice for reducing shadows in lower light locations, but again, remember that too much light will flatten out your features. This would be ok for makeup tutorials though since itd show a difference in contouring effects well.\n\nPros:\n-arrived pre-charged and ready to use.\n-easy to use. Click the button to cycle through brightness levels.\n-clip feels secure. Strong and also has foam to keep it from slipping and to protect your phone.\n-can make a significant difference in photos (see attached pics)\n-rechargeable via USB (has cord, you supply the plug. The one from your phone should be ok)\n\nCons:\n-Ill get back to you.", "summary": "Worth the money", "unixReviewTime": 1527552000}

I am currently using this in the city of Brasilia in my hotel room and just so glad I don't have to pull out the USB hub I brought along.\n--- old review ---\nI frequently travel on business internationally and always carry a couple of adapters on me. Inevitably one or more of my colleagues travelling with me don't have adapters for their laptops. I'm often confused how they think they are going to plug into a foreign socket so I'm frequently loaning out my adapters... but I digress.\n\nWhat I like about this adapter is the universality. It not only adapts to foreign sockets but will also take multiple foreign plug appliances. So if I buy something in the UK and take it to France I can still plug it in. And you never know when you have to purchase a new brick for the laptop because I've left one behind accidentally. So having the ability to accommodate foreign plugs and sockets is just what I need.\n\nIn addition it does provide a plastic ground plug for the UK socket because some will not allow you to plug in without the ground.", "summary": "Great plug adapter for both plugs and sockets", "unixReviewTime": 1473120000}

In the past I've always just tried to give my phone an extra fill in the car, but often it's not plugged in there long enough to recharge to the level I need, or I'm not somewhere that's feasible to access my car and so my mobile battery begins to run out mid day.

As another stated, it would be great if there was a way to tell how much charge is left in it, but if you can get a general idea of how many charges you get before it needs a refill you can just use that info to charge it regularly after so many recharges it's given to your phone or other device.", "summary": "Great device for those of us who's smartphone batteries poop out half way through the day...", "unixReviewTime": 1425081600}

Amazon seems to have commingled reviews for that product with those for the RP-WCN14 Qi car charger, the subject of this review. Some of the comments in the negative reviews are for the RP-WCN12 and do not apply to the RP-WCN14. For example, the RP-WCN14 does have a detachable USB cable, apparently a negative point for the RP-WCN12.\n\nSo let's get to the car charger. I comes with a dash mount, with a suction base with a sticky material on the bottom. Attached to a flat surface, like the dashboard, it is not going anywhere. I had it mounted for days and it was still very hard to remove it. It also comes with another mechanism for mounting the charger into a vent in the car. While it is a little tricky to figure out, it also works quite well. The charging cradle itself has a slot on the back, and both of the mounts have a ball joint attachment that locks into the slot. The ball joints can be loosened to adjust the cradle (and the phone clamped into it) to any position. The charging cradle has a button to open the clamping mechanism so the phone can be placed, and then you squeeze to quickly clamp the phone into the cradle.\n\nI like to use my phone, a Nexus 5, in the landscape mode as a GPS. This device is perfect for holding the phone in the right position and charging it at the same time. I should add that the charger works fine with my Nexus 5 in a Spigen TPU case and also in a Acase soft silicone/polycarbonate hybrid case, so no need to remove the phone from the case.\n\nIs this a quantum leap from the typical car mount and USB car charger setup? No, but it is a bigger improvement than I thought it would be. The biggest advantage is that there is no more need to find the USB cable attached to the conventional car charger, and then plug it into the phone. You simply pop the phone into the Qi mount and go. My wife is envious because her phone doesn't have the capability to use this RAVPower charger.\n\nAs you expect from RAVPower the charger is well designed, and has a quality feel to it. The cost is quite reasonable given that you get two types of mounts and a Qi charger. The mounts alone would cost almost as much.", "summary": "Slick car charger with flexible mounting if you have a Qi capable phone.", "unixReviewTime": 1420329600}

Unfortunately, that did not happen.\n\nFirst off, the softer portion of the case is molded terribly.

I suppose I could use an Xacto knife to cut them off, but the point is every cheap rubber case I've ever purchased for any of my cell phones never had this problem.\n\nThe back of the Incredible 2 has 3 holes for microphones and the noise cancel, yet the case has no provision for them.  Some have reviewed that it doesn't cause a problem, but it does for mine.  With the case on, voices sound muffled or echoed.  With the case off, voices are loud and clear.\n\nThis case does come with a clear screen protector, a cleaning cloth, and a card to help apply the screen protector.  While this was an unexpected bonus, don't get your hopes up.  The protector is not even remotely close to fitting the screen.  It is not wide enough and the corners don't match the shape of the phone.  There is a cutout for the front facing camera, but even that doesn't look to match up properly.  It honestly looks like someone \"eyeballed\" the phone and then cut the screen protector out by hand.\n\nSadly, this case will be returned to Amazon.", "summary": "Poor finish, blocks microphones.", "unixReviewTime": 1318464000}

It's thin and flexible, but still seems to protect my phone really well. As you can see in the video, the case comes in two pieces that are disassembled when installing on the phone. The first layer is a rubber sleeve that covers the sides and back of the phone to protect it from shock and scratch damage. The second piece is the hard plastic outside layer that protects the phone from impact damage on the back and sides. You can see in the video that the case was easy to install and seems to hold my phone securely. I really like the kickstand on the back of the case. It's great for setting my phone down at an angle to watch a movie or simple to have it at a convenient angle while sitting at my desk. My only suggestion would be that it be designed to work with either portrait or landscape (this model only works if your phone is sideways in landscape mode).

Here is a report on what those were, what other uses I discovered, and how Glass fared in regard to each use.\n\nA better action video camera?\nI had high hopes for Google Glass to be a replacement for my $50 bullet camera with better battery life, better image quality (because of the wide-angle lense) and better operability (because I see what it records and can pause it etc).\nThe verdict: Glass fails in this category. The battery life is even shorter (30 minutes tops with a full battery right off the charger). I can wear it under my aero-helmet, but not without feeling pressure. This is a no-go on even the shortest bike rides or runs. The low-light capability is not great, either, and on my night runs with a head light there is not much to see on the resulting video.\nIt does not fit under or over ski goggles, and the clear or active shades do not replace goggles (too small and too much draft that will tear up eyes at higher speeds).\n\nAn in-vehicle or dashboard camera?\nA camera that reliably and continuously records what happens around me when I drive would be great. Glass is promising, because it captures my field of view, including the rear view mirror, but it is not reliable and cannot record continuously. When plugged in, the battery life would be no issue, but there is currently no app that records continuously (and overwrites earlier clips when memory runs out). Also, the display is always on when it records video, which is bothersome at night.\nWith a little bit of practice it is possible to wake up Glass and get into video recording mode in a matter of a few seconds, but that is not fast enough in unexpected situations.\nMy verdict: I think that the device has potential in this category with the right software. Currently it is limited.\n\nA better run/ride tracker?\nI saw that Strava has Glass apps even before I placed my Glass order, and I uploaded my entire workout history from Garmin to Strava in anticipation of using their apps with Glass.\nThe verdict: Glass fails in this category, but my reasoning requires explanation, because admittedly this is the fault of my Nexus 5 and not so much the fault of Glass. Glass relies on the GPS sensor of the phone, and the Strava app only works when the phone is paired. Unfortunately my Nexus 5s GPS sensor data appears to be very inaccurate.  When I started a \"Run\" on Strava while walking the dog, it placed me some 50 yards away from the road that I was on. I will continue to depend on the good old Garmin 305 in the coming years.\nIn addition to issue with GPS accuracy, I don't take Glass on runs because I sweat a lot from the head and both the power button and the bone-conduction speaker would be exposed and allow sweat (or rain water!) to enter the device.\n\nA better headset?\nA resounding no here. The bone conduction speaker vibrates and tickles behind my ear. Having longer conversations on Glass is uncomfortable. The sound quality is moderate at best, and many times there is some kind of mechanical obstruction that causes strong distortions, to a point where I cannot understand the other party. I keep my Glass clean and protected, so I am not sure what causes the distortion. Maybe a tiny dust particle is all it takes.\nThe ear bud speaker that is now included with Glass is too cumbersome to deal with for me. Glass is already bulky and in the way when you take if off because you can't simply fold it and put it in your shirt pocket. Now having something dangling on a USB cord attached to Glass is a non-starter. I have not even taken the ear bud out of the box yet.\n\nA hands-free smart phone controller?\nBeing able to control important features of your phone without actually having to look at it or even hold in your hand is a compelling feature. If you use Gmail and Hangouts exclusively, you are being well-served by Glass. You will be alerted by and can read instant messages. and respond to and write instant messages and emails by using the voice recognition that works pretty reliably for me.\nI don't seem to be able to create emails from scratch, only instant messages to one of up to 10 contacts. I do see emails in my Gmail inbox, though. They appear as a new slide in the timeline and I can respond to them without ever touching Glass. This is pretty cool.\nThe verdict: Unfortunately, I use neither Gmail nor Hangouts, and I frankly don't get Hangouts. I cannot access emails on my company's Exchange server or my personal IMAP service from Glass, and while I have over 1,000 contacts on my phone, I only see 14 contacts on Glass. This pretty much renders Glass useless as a communication device.\n\nA better navigation device?\nI really like the way navigation works. I have one car with a built-in navigation system and will not use Glass there - it certainly does not compete with the Mercedes Comand System. In my other car I do not have a navigation system at all, and previously I had to meddle with the phone when I needed directions. This works so much better on Glass.\nMy verdict: Navigation is definitely a compelling use of the product, in the car as well as on the bike or on foot (even though Google Maps lacks trail data). Based on some recent incidents that made national headlines, it appears that there is currently doubt among law enforcement officers whether using Glass while driving is legal and safe. I can attest that it can be surprising and distracting when Glass comes to live in full brightness during a night drive to alert you of an upcoming turn, but I don't find it all that different from having a GPS device in the car that is on all the time.\n\nA better music streaming device?\nWith access to Google Music and completely hands-free operation through voice-activated searches, Glass offers yet another compelling use.\nMy verdict: Exciting possibilities, but currently we have to compromise on either poor audio quality or complicated handling/wiring of ear buds. The mono ear bud that comes with Glass is, well, mono only; stereo ear buds are available for an extra $85, and my ears aren't made for ear bud-type headphones anyway. They tend to hurt and fall out, and the same is true for the ear bud that came with Glass. Voice search appears to be mostly broken. I have close to 20,000 songs on Google Music and searches only randomly find stuff. Is it possible that the songs have to reside in the phone's cache for this to work? Overall, I am somewhat indifferent about Glass' current usefulness as a music streaming device.\n\nOther uses?\nGlassware can be installed from the phone or the computer. The current selection of applications that work with Glass is limited (I just counted 35), which I find surprising, given how long Glass has been available to the development community already.\nMy verdict: The speed of adoption among application developers seems to be slow and the number of available applications is small. I am confident that this will change. Still, no more than a null-vote on other uses at this time.\n\nA mature and well-tested device?\nI run into odd and unexpected situations with Glass almost daily that require some tinkering to figure out. Examples?\n*The on-head detection is flakey and sometimes shuts off Glass unexpectedly. I figured this out myself and the chatter on the Explorer forums confirmed my diagnosis. I just disabled this feature entirely.\n*The \"Ok Glass\" command stopped working on the 3rd day. I had to do a factory reset to get it back.\n*When I did a factory reset, it took several attempts and an uninstall of the MyGlass app on the Nexus 5 before I was able to pair them again. Glass would just not get into pairing mode.\n*Currently, phone calls or navigation don't work while on a Wifi connection, even though I am paired and connected with the Nexus 5. There is no way to \"disable\" the wireless connection temporarily. You have to make Glass \"Forget\" the connection to make a call and then recreate it. The phone reports the Bluetooth profile \"Phone Audio\", not \"Headset\" as one would expect.\n*I am perpetually confused by what contacts I get to see on Glass. I understand that I can add up to 10 contacts from my phone that will show up on Glass as separate slides. So far I added 5 contacts. When I want to make a phone call, I am presented with 14 contact choices, though, the same people that appear in my Hangouts on Google. With half of them I have had no contact in years and I don't have the slightest idea how they ended up there.\n\nMy overall verdict:\nThe head-mounted display and its possibilities are exciting and an indication that this technology will become pervasive in the very near future. But Glass appears to still be an experimental device that does not excel in any particular discipline, comes with a high price tag, and that non-techie consumers will struggle with. The short battery life severely limits its practical use and spoils the fun.\nI no longer keep my Glass charged and use it maybe once a month. It still works as a conversation-starter and that's pretty much the only thing I use it for.", "summary": "Expensive, but mostly useless gimmick", "unixReviewTime": 1399507200}

Now that I'm using an iPhone 6 Plus, I'm happy to have anything over a 10000 mAh charger so as to make sure I can get through a heavy use day. This LifeCHARGE has that and more...\n\nIn terms of size, it's 6.5\" long and slightly over 3\" wide (with just under an inch in depth). It's got some heft to it at one pound, but I'm used to that when you start getting into the 20000mAh size and beyond.\n\nThe white case gives it a very clean look that doesn't pick up any fingerprints or smudges. The on/off button sits on the side right next to the two USB ports. On the top edge you have the micro-USB slot for charging, as well as a small LED bulb that you can turn on with the on/off button. The front of the unit has four blue LED lamps that serve as the power remaining indicator.\n\nI used this over a four day period to top off my charge on the iPhone 6 Plus. In just under 500 minutes of usage, I was able to get 225% of charge, *and* I still have two LED lights showing on the power meter. On my iPhone 5s, I was used to getting about 1% charge per minute of use, but the iPhone 6 Plus battery is a lot bigger. I'm happy with the two minutes per 1% recharge rate, and I'm *very* happy to know that I could get at least three full recharges on this battery before I'd have to plug it back in. Couple that with the fact that I can share the charger with another device (with the dual USB slots), and this becomes a must-pack charger for my trips.\n\nI have a week-long conference coming up in May where I'll be using my iPhone and iPad a lot during the day. Having this charger makes me feel much more comfortable with my ability to go hard all day.\n\nDisclosure:\nObtained From: Vendor\nPayment: Free", "summary": "Power and flexibility...", "unixReviewTime": 1428710400}

Installing the case on your phone is easy and the fitment is perfect with all ports and buttons aligned exactly where they should be. If this case holds up against drops as well as my previous Incipio had, then it will have served its purpose. The inner cushion shell has an added stiffness to it compared to my older model for my Droid Maxx, which is a definite plus. Any case will increase the dimensions of your phone, but for me personally it doesn't add that much extra and the benefit of having a case is plentiful.\n\nCons\n- None as of yet\n\nConclusion\nIn my experience a case like this is all you need to protect your phone. The gorilla glass which seems standard on phones now days does well against impacts and scratches, except for corner glass impacts which is really where you experience damage. The raised lip of the case eliminates corner and full face impacts, and because of that there is no need for a screen protector, this of course has been my experience and opinion.", "summary": "Perfect fit", "unixReviewTime": 1459123200}

I've recently been upgrading to higher mAh capacity protected 18650 batteries in order to extend runtimes on my flashlights.  Unfortunately with the higher mAh comes at a cost of larger cells that have prevented them from fitting in most of my 18650 flashlights.  My usual quality brands were becoming too wide at these higher capacities to fit my flashlights, from single cell to others with battery carriers.  I have some ThruNite flashlights, but never purchased their cells previously as my goto 18650 brand had served me well until width issues surfaced.  So I took the plunge after being frustrated with other top 18650 brands that no longer fit my flashlights and my search is over.  These protected 18650 cells fit ALL of my flashlights whether it's single cell, multi cell or battery carrier.  The reason seems to be that the PCB is a top mounted only version and not a top and bottom with a strip down the side.  This top mounted PCB variety seems to keep the width a little slimmer than the usual top, bottom and strip PCB's.  I'm not sure on the pro's and con's of this particular setup, but I can say that they fit all my lights and seems to provide the added runtimes that I was looking for in higher mAh cells.  Time will tell how these hold up and perform, but for now I am happy to find a 3400mAh cell that fits and seems to be of high quality (they are wrapped nicely)....", "summary": "Finally one that fits all my 18650 flashlights", "unixReviewTime": 1455321600}

So far, the Commuter has fit the bill.\n\nThe Commuter consists of 3 parts, a screen protector (applied with an applicator to 'try' to smooth out the bubbles), a silicon sleeve to protect the sides and back from drops and impacts, and frame / metal wrap to keep the silicon sleeve in place.\n\nOverall, the pieces and parts work well to protect the phone from scratches, dings, and most importantly (for me) drops.  I've dropped the phone several times now on hardwood floors (just my lack of coordination) pulling it out of my pocket (3ft) and have seen no signs of damage to the phone.  The screen protector is doing its job, and doesn't seem to easily scratch (the phone sometimes rides around in my pocket with keys, and still looks perfect).  Additionally, since most of the ports are well protected, small splashes haven't seemed to hurt it at all, even though it doesn't claim waterproof abilities.\n\nAnother nice thing about this case is that it adds very little in the way of size.  The iPhone is a fairly good sized phone to begin with, but this case is a very small addition and the protection is well worth it.  The buttons are all easy to press with the case on, and the speakers still provide close to the same sound (from what I can tell).\n\nThe only reason I've given this a 4 instead of a 5 is because sometimes the case tries to slip from the edges occasionally, and the covers for the ports can sometimes be a pain to get back into place.  Overall though, I can't complain and have been very happy with its level of protection and small size.", "summary": "Durable, and Hardly Noticable", "unixReviewTime": 1257379200}

Triple packed in fact.\n-Comes with all necessary cleaning pads and instructions\n-Screen protector is thin\n\nPre- Installation:\n-Wiped phone down with my personal electronic wipes.\n-I wiped phone down again\n-I used air can to blow out any loose dust particles.\n-I then 'test fitted' the Pleson screen protector\n\nActual Installation:\n-Wash your hands! ;)\n-I wiped both sides of the screen protector off slowly. Rubbing too hard creates static.\n-I then wiped the phone down with the provided wet wipe.\n-After the wet wipe, you can use the dry wipe but FYI. This caused extra static for me due to the winter months and dry air. I chose to re-wipe the screen with the wet wipe and allow to air dry briefly before applying the protector.\n-Removing the plastic shield from the protector should be done SLOWLY, so you don't create static. Be sure to not squeeze too hard on the sides or your fingerprints will show.\n-I grabbed the sides of the top and the bottom. I started with the bottom. It is much easier to align the lower part up and then guide the top.\n-Once the bottom is squared around the speaker, guide the top using the sides to keep it straight and gently set the top down on the phone.\n-The screen protector should automatically start to settle and you will see it do it's magic.\n\nDisadvantages:\nThe top could cover a little bit more. The top left on this phone doesn't cover as high as I'd like.\nThe screen protector is much thinner than what I removed. Maybe it will protect as well, I am not sure.\n\nProblems encountered:\nDry environment in winter time caused a lot of static and I had to remove the protector twice. The maximum Pleson recommends before adhesion loss around edges occur. The problem I had is that there was so much dust, the sticker they provide wasn't cutting it, so I ran the scren protector under warm water for a few seconds and shook it off while it was facing down as best as possible. I then re-installed after cleaning phone yet again... The plus side of wetting it allowed me to slide it around to get it perfect. The downside to this was many many fingernail strokes to remove all water and air. The pics were taken immediately after and really need a day to fully dry underneath because of my problems. BUT I was able to salvage a high quality screen protector!\n\nFinal thoughts:\n-It is very form fitting. By this I mean slim and shrunken to fit the FLAT part of the screen. The Moto X Pure has very rounded/curved edges and any protector that tries to fit the screen entirely will have lifted edges where dust gets in and it doesn't look pretty. I've tried 3 other brand screen protectors and this one fits the best.\n-I really like that the bottom enclosed the speaker. All others I have tried have an open bottom and I do not like that.\n\nRecommendations:\nI recommend this product for the Moto X Pure due to the curved screen and not many have fit well.\nTake your time. You use your phone daily and will likely have this protector for a year or more. Take the extra 10min and slow down during installation.\nMy last recommendation is to keep an up to date and current secondary camera in the house. I am so used to my 21MP camera on my phone, I didn't realize how terrible my 12mp Olympus camera is. I apologize for the bad pics. :(\n\nI hope this was helpful. I took the extra time trying to provide as much detail as possible since i recieved this for Free to provide an unbiased review for the community. I wouldn't want to steer anyone in the wrong direction because lets face it, our phones are as important to us as our cars. maybe even more.", "summary": "Best fitting Protector for Moto X Pure", "unixReviewTime": 1455580800}

The case is well made and easily installed. We wiped down the phone and inserted the bottom edge into the case and then gave a slight twist to the case so the volume buttons edge slipped in. After that we simply applied a slight pressure to slip the top right corn in to the case an presto the S7 edge is now well protected. The case is a soft flexible rubber material and the outer back is textured dotted pattern that is a separate hard shell that goes over the soft rubber case. The texture adds a nice grip area so it is no where near as slippery as the original phone back. This case does add a little thickness to the phone but it is well received by everyone who holds the phone. We have come across a few who did not like the soft rubber top and bottom but most approved of this case. Great looking case with a lot of functionality which make this a nice looking case to complement your S7 edge. We found no issues with using the edge feature as the sides are recessed so they do not interfere with the screen edge. We are able to leave the case on while it is on our wireless charger which is a really big plus. Honestly this is a nice case for the price. The S7 edge is well protected in this case thanks to the soft rubber inside shell. I did feel the inner soft rubber portion of the case was a little too soft so I deducted 1 star.\n\nYes - I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a new or replacement case for the new Samsung S7 Edge.\n\nNote: I received this product at a discount for an honest and unbiased review.

I'm the type of person who simply assumes that I can figure out how most things work without needing to read the manuals, and most of the time that's true. I had to check the manual in order to figure out how to turn the flashlight on, but that's not really a big deal, as once I learned how to do it, I haven't had to look at the manual again. Ultimately, though, the primary function of this device is to serve as a backup battery, and getting it to work in that regard is a no-brainer, and it works flawlessly for that.\n\nOverall, I think the iTorch has a great physical design, more than adequate capacity for a single-user to get through the day, and the performance meets my expectations.

If you are anything like me, halfway through your day, your phone is dying and you don't have your charger with you. I received the gold case, but ordinarily I would have gotten the silver one.  No matter though, the gold one is pretty sharp looking too. Using this MFi certified case with my iPhone 6/6s and then placing it on the Qi wireless charger (reviewed separately), you can wirelessly charge your phone quickly and easily.\n\nThis battery case is super thin and has an internal 590mAh Lithium-Polymer battery capacity providing additional talk time as well as surf, download and streaming time. The material around the edges has a high-quality feel and provides rubberized grip while also being lightweight and sturdy. The description also notes that the product is tear-resistant although I hope not to have to ever verify this. The case itself provides reliable protection from getting scratched up.\n\nThe company is pretty awesome too - I mean they give such a warranty you can't go wrong. They say if anyone has issues with any GPEL products, they will make it right.  All in all, this is a great battery case with an extra feature of wireless charging with the other product (reviewed separately). I give it a 4 star rating instead of 5, because I do not care for products that have the company logo plastered on them.\n\nIf you found my review helpful itd be great if you please click yes below.

I use it for my Samsung Galaxy S5, in a Tech Armor SlimProtect Case, and it fits just fine.  The clasp on the top doesn't close as easily due to the addition of the case.  However, due to the secure fit of the phone, that's not a concern for me.  It's great to have the slots in the back for my Driver's License and another card or small amount of cash.  I generally slide a debit card and $5-10 in there if I'm right around the local area.  If I'm going off away from home, I don't put much of anything in there due to the possibility of it being lost.  The slots are tight, making the chances of that very slim.  A slim chance is a chance, though, and I'd rather not risk it.\n\nMy only *almost* complaint with this is that the longer strap might have been 3-5 inches longer.  That would have made it easier to use as a cross-body bag.  I consider, though, that this is likely a product that was designed for younger persons (children and adolescents), and my older, larger frame isn't what it was designed for.  Therefore, I've made the best use of what's available to me.  I clip both straps together when I need the freedom a cross body bag offers, creating the perfect length.

Others keep charging, even at 100% getting the device super hot and doing who knows what kind of damage.  This one gets mildly hot, but seems to stop charging at 100% and then, when the battery drains a little, it starts charging again.

The Diztronic Flexible TPU case does just that and does it well.

One was missing the Motorola emblem and I am pretty much convinced that these were either refurbished or knock-offs.  I will wait for Motorola's response to find out.  However, the price was low (now I think I know why) so overall I guess I got what I paid for.  They do work without a problem and the battery life is excellent.  I would recommend the device to others.  I really like it for its functionality and will try to find some ear pads for it.  I would recommend it but caution other buyers to beware that sometimes the lowest price is not worth it.", "summary": "Works well", "unixReviewTime": 1252713600}

I'm also occasionally in the field for work and play.  After reading many reviews I decided on this one.  First off, it is very big with all the layers put on and will surely do the protection job.  Fully assembled I found a couple things I didn't like.  First the flaps to cover the camera and usb port were a little annoying.  The camera flap makes spontaneous picture taking a little more difficult as you have to stop, dig it out and get it to catch in the little hole.  Since the phone has to be charged at least daily, digging out the usb cover was more of an inconvenience than a help.  The other thing I didn't like was the size of the belt clip.  It seems to be made for 3\" belts and on a standard sized belt it just flops around.  I do like the face in protection for the screen and the fact that with so many layers of protection, it will do the job out in the field.  With all the layers, it feels more like I am carrying a 2-way field radio than a cell phone. It does what it is supposed to do and I'm glad I bought it, but I find myself just using it in the innocase (the first layer) and carrying it in my shirt pocket most of the time.", "summary": "Big and protective", "unixReviewTime": 1305158400}

So if that's what you're looking for, this isn't the case for you. I've had my phone in an Otterbox for 2 years because I was under contract with Verizon and I wanted to protect the investment that I was stuck with for 2 years. Now that my contract is up, and knowing I could walk in tomorrow and upgrade my phone for a small amount of money, i can rest a little easier and be a little more liberal with my phone. It's a shame to cover up such a gorgeous phone with a bulky case but I just can't allow myself to go completely unprotected. This was the perfect solution. It allows some protection against minor drops and bumps and at the same time, doesn't hide the beauty of the phone.", "summary": "I love it!", "unixReviewTime": 1438128000}

The trim around edges give it an elegant look. The back looks like tweed but feels like rubber to me. The bottom of case is completely open except for corners. It looks good. I'll have to let you know later if it starts falling apart on me like some are complaining about. Since the outside feels like rubber and not cloth, I can't figure out how it could start fraying at edges like some say. Maybe they got a different one than I did.

I am assuming these marks were in the seal layer applied to the glass as when installed they were easily visible the first day, but after that they started fading and by the end of 2nd day were no longer visible.  Lesson learned:  if there is a blemish that is NOT dust, give it a day or two to see if will fade.\n\nAdditionally, iCarez csupport checked in to see how the product was working for me and when I discussed the issues I was having, they quickly started working with me a fast resolution.  Kuddos to iCarez.\n\nSince installation I have noticed the protector lifts from the screen slightly when the power button or volume is pressed due to the case, but immediately reseals within seconds.  This is not an issue for me, but reminds me to be very careful when centering the protector.  There is such little room for error for the protector to be off-center with a case and if the protector is not perfectly aligned, the case could put some pressure on the side, as is my case.  Mine is only off by a fraction (1/32 at best), but enough.\n\n[Original Post]\nThe protector is nice, but installation, dust control, and some spots on protector is of concern to be careful of.\n\nIn the past I have used screen protectors (film), but went without a screen protector on my S3 for several years without issue, even with phone in pockets.  With the 6P I thought I would try the glass protectors to see.  So far I am liking the glass MUCH better than film protectors.\n\nSo positive, I can barely tell protector is there (except for the raised edge cutouts around speakers).  Only a few blemishes and dust spots give it away.  It is also very smooth to the touch.\n\nThe bad...while the protector is very nice, with smooth clean edges, and near screen feel, the issue I have comes to dust on panel before I removed protected film off and several spots with the material and edges.  The dust itself was only a few spots, but very noticeable. Before installation I washed my hands twice, used a terry cloth to blot dry them, and ensured area was completely clean.  After cleaning the screen I started to take the film off on side that goes against the screen, only to notice before I got very far that there was some dust on the protector.  Quickly attempting to clean it I found the dust was between the film and the protector, meaning it was in place when manufacturing.  Removing the film I found several of the dust to be on the outside of protector (so no concern) and only one inside.  Sadly, after I got protector in place I found that 2 others I thought were not on protector WERE.  Once in place I could not lift side to get to dust and even with screen on, they were noticeable.\n\n**no longer issue...see update above**  This brings me to the 2nd manufacturing issue:  there are 2 small spots/circles about 3/16 inch in diameter next to one another that are a flaw in the glass itself.  Maybe where machine/manufacturing was in play?  Again, with screen on, these were still visible.\n\nLastly, on bottom on both left and right corners (more on left) is almost a fingerprint looking impression.  This impression is not fingerprints, but a manufacturing texture.  It is in the area off screen, so doesn't affect that at least, but very visible against the black face of the phone.\n\nOverall, I still like the protector, even with the several issues I noticed.\n\n[Final thoughts...]\nSo would I buy the protector again?  Yes.  In today's high durable screens, a screen protector is becoming less needed, but for a new device that sometimes finds it's way into pockets with keys and my prior phone falling into dirt few months ago while working in yard (accidents DO happen...luckily no issue/scrach/dent happened), having extra protection just as a \"just in case\" isn't a bad idea.  If choice is for film protection, I would rather go without.  But with this glass protector, my view is changing back to liking a protector.\n\nIf someone was shopping would I recommend?  Yes, but with strong recommendation to check with manufacturer if you see any issues in screen or dust on screen prior to installation, but wait a few days first to see if it disappears.", "summary": "The protector is nice", "unixReviewTime": 1451347200}

I have never been disappointed by a Caseology case, and I've had several of them now (for different phones). I was concerned when I received this one for my Samsung s7 Edge because it looked like it left the curved edge glass  totally exposed, and it does to pointed objects. However, most phone injuries come from dropping them onto a flat surface. Concerned, though, that it wouldn't protect the phone from a fall on its side, I set the phone face down on a flat surface and shone a flashlight behind the phone onto the surface. The entire surface beneath the phone lit up, convincing me that if the phone face plants on a flat surface, the glass is not going to be hit. (I keep emphasizing on a flat surface as no phone case but one with a protective front shield, which loses the clarity of the wonderful HD screen and becomes cloudy and gets scratched very soon, not to mention how inconvenient it is to work around it.) The sides and back of the Caseology case are of a texture that the phone no longer feels like a bar of soap, eager to slip out of my hands and become damaged.\n\nMy only regret (a very small one) is that all of their cases for the Edge have gold trim while my phone is all silver (one of the three styles available from Verizon Wireless). I wish they had a case that had silver or other non-gold trim to perhaps look a little \"chic\"-er with my all silver phone.\n\n(I'll update my review later if I experience anything to the contrary of its being a protective case.)", "summary": "Caseology does it again - great case for a good price!", "unixReviewTime": 1461715200}

The Powerline cables I have all over my house, the cheaper cables are great for areas you'll just put your device down and let it charge.  I use the Powerline+ in areas where we actually like to play on the phone while it charges.  The neck on the powerline+ is more durable so if you're moving the phone a lot it should handle a lot of bending at the neck of the cable (I have had some of these cable fray at the neck so they are not impervious to bend/break like Apple cables)  Finally the powerline+ II  I only have a couple of the cables, I use them with my powerbanks beccause not only do they seem to charge faster, but they are more durable and when I'm charging with my powerbank I'm constantly moving, bending, pulling on the cable, have not had a problem with the Powerline+ II, just can't afford to upgrade all the cables in my house with this expensive line.\n\nLove Anker Products. Anker stands by their products and replaces anything for free as long as it's under warranty (usualy 12-18 months depending on the product).  There is 1 thing I hate about Anker customer support, they are completely impersonal.  You'll read this grievance in my most of my recent reviews, I'll explain and let you decide for yourself if Anker Support could have, should have, treated me better.  Just bought multiple items as Christmas gifts for 16 family members (16 power banks, 16 lightning cables, 8 micro USB cables, 8 Wall Chargers, 5 Car Chargers)  Not only did I spend a lot of money but I gave Anker 16 new customers that are already purchasing more Anker products.  So when my personal 6ft Powerline+ lightning cable broke after a few months of minimal use (exposing the wire) I sent in my request for a new cable.  I explained how much I love Anker, how I just got my entire family Anker products and got Anker a bunch of new customers and I was surprised the cable broke so easily.  I asked if they could replace my cable with the 6ft Powerline+ II, figuring it may be more durable.  Their reply was surprising, they wanted to refund me for my cable so I could purchased the newer cable.  They did not offer a discount for the new cable, so essential they were not willing to give me the newer cable for free, it would have cost me a few more dollars and honestly I can't imagine it really costing Anker more than a few cents for the upgraded cable.  This is such a huge turn off, I'm the customer you want, not just a guy who buys a cable, but someone who buys many, many products from you, gives your products to all of my family members, and promotes your products to everyone... So many of my friends have also gotten Anker cables based on my recommendation. Highly disappointed in your customer service skills Anker, still love your products but I don't plan on promoting your products until you learn how to treat your GREAT CUSTOMERS BETTER.", "summary": "Great Product, Great Warranty, Horrible Customer Service", "unixReviewTime": 1515110400}

Burke", "reviewText": "In the past I'd never think to review a charger dock.  It seems so simple, what is there to really say?\nWell, my previous phone is an HTC Aria, and the dock I bought for it was awful.  I was shocked to learn about all the ways a product could be made badly.\n\nThat is why I am happy and specifically saying, this dock is great.  The fit I give a 9/10 - well above average, not perfect but in no way bad.  There's a slight discernible play sliding the device in which isn't problematic but sometimes noticeable.  This 9/10 may be a 10/10 for some people, because perhaps that millimeter of play gives you room for a case (don't hold your breath though).  I'm gonna get a slim case and update my review shortly.\n\nAlso sliding it into the dock and onto the micro USB is smooth and easy.  Bundled also are two cables thoughtfully labelled power and data - presumably because power cables are made with fewer wire connections (saves a penny I guess).  I could whine that it may not be two data cables, but instead I will praise them for delivering as advertised and going the extra mile and labeling the cables.  Well done.  Additionally a power transformer is bundled, looking very similar to the OEM one which ships with the Galaxy S II.\n\nThe rear battery slot is a bit of a snug fit, I'd like it a little looser so I could more easily drop the battery in there, but it's not a problem.  The rear LED changes color once the battery is dropped in and charging.\n\nThe overall finish of the part closely resembles the gloss black finish of your Galaxy S II (mine is an AT&T model, FYI).  I like it a lot.  I find the front red EVO logo to be out of proportion with everything else.  It is simultaneously subtle yet distracting.  Clearly not a deal breaker.\n\nLastly, the device doesn't interfere with data sync at all, unlike some other docking bays.  Sync occurs as naturally as it does with a direct USB connection.", "summary": "Well done!", "unixReviewTime": 1317945600}

However, once you have taken the picture it is zoomed out 2x from what you saw in the preview. The capture is delayed by 5s max. Doesn't charge as quickly as other brand new phones - leads me to believe the battery has some wear and this is a refurbished phone/parts. Start up/reboot is considerably and noticeably slow.\n\nWhat i love.. the shape and style.

Trianium Atomic, ZVOLTZ, Unu and the Anker Slim are the others.\n\nAll of them extend battery life by 75-100%. All of them weigh about 3 ounces, except the ZVOLTZ (over 3.5 oz), all of them are well finished with all cutouts and ports fully aligned and easily accessible. All of them ship with mini-USB charging cables and headphone extension jacks. The Unu and ZVOLTZ cases have the same blue charge lights as the Ankers, so you'll know when the case is fully charged.\n\nWhere the Ankers differ is in how the case delivers juice to the phone. Most battery cases deliver a more or less constant charge to your phone. With the Anker design, when you press a button on the back of the case, you can see how much power remains in the case, and you also begin to charge the phone. As I wrote in my review of the Anker Slim battery case, Anker lets you be the boss of your phone.\n\nWhile I liked all the cases, the Anker Slim was my favorite, so far. So with that background, you need to know that this new Extended Battery case is a little wider (1-2mm) and a little heavier (3.5 oz. vs the Slim's 2.9 oz.) than the Slim. However, it is only .2 oz heavier than the Unu and weighs about the same as the ZVoltz. The finish on the Extended case is a bit different, too. I previously described the Anker Slim as sueded, but now, comparing them side by side, would amend that to \"matte\", calling this Extended case \"Sueded\". It's even less shiny than the Slim, with zero sheen. The Slim has a slight sheen. Staying with the tactile, the sides on this Extended case feel a little less rounded than the sides on the slim. The transition from the back to the sides is definitely squared off, making room for the extra battery. It makes a subtle difference in the grip that i like. Both are comfortable hold, it's just personal preference.\n\nPackaging on this case was typical Anker quality, we'll-constructed cardboard box with good directions for use and minimal waste. I won't go on about that, other than to write that I appreciate that Anker prints the instructions on the paper that wraps the box, saving a bit of paper. I like that.\n\nLet's get to the nitty-gritty. I charged the case and my phone to 100%. 48 hours later my phone was at 19% power so I pushed the button on my Anker Extended case and gave it a jolt. It was soon back up to 100%. 48 hours later, my phone was back down to about 20% power. this is when all of the other cases, would no longer be much use to me. But with this Extended case, I was still showing quite a bit of charge on my case, so gave my phone another boost. It charged up to 87% power this time. This charge only gave me an extra 18 hours before my phone was in the red zone again, but I was using a lot of Safari when we were out to lunch. And then there's Bejeweled, too, one of my favorite time and power sucks, which saw heavy use yesterday. So while most of the other battery cases I've tried doubled my phone's power life, this Extended case increased it by about 130%. If my use had been fairly constant, I'd guess it would be closer to 170%.\n\nAs you see, I'm a light/casual user. During my test run, I always had open the following: Kindle, UnBlock Me, Paprika and Sudoku. Frequently open were Messages, Phone, My Fitness Pal, Fitbit and Weather. None of these are particularly battery intensive. Other apps that I close as soon as I'm done with them include Bejeweled, Safari, Maps and Passbook.\n\nBottom line, this is the perfect case for anyone, even power users, planning a weekend getaway. Imagine being 100% cordless while on a trip. With much more than double the life, this Anker Extended case makes that possible. And you still get to be the boss of your phone.", "summary": "Another Winner From Anker", "unixReviewTime": 1426291200}

Zorach", "reviewText": "First off, I'm a lifelong Apple fan as far as computers go, but I'm certainly a convert from iPhone-- used the iPhone 4, 5, and the iPad Mini and replaced my iPhone with this when Sprint wanted to charge me $500 to buy a new iPhone 5S. As far as this product versus other Q10's, perhaps you're wondering about buying this versus the much more expensive black Q10 without the Arabic keyboard. They're identical-- except that this also comes with European/African power plugs, plus a flimsy but functional North American one (plus, who doesn't have a few extras lying around-- I sure do). So, that's convenient, and hopefully you won't be fazed by the documentation in UK English and Arabic (\"learn about how to set up your favourite smartphone\"). Next up, maybe you're wondering about buying this versus the BlackBerry Classic-- they're also basically the same phone. Same amount of RAM, same processor speed, same internal memory. The BlackBerry Classic has the old school buttons, which is fine, but not worth the extra $300 for me.\n\nIt's important to note that when you buy the Q10, you're not buying an iPhone 6-- you're buying a BlackBerry. All of the badmouthing of the BlackBerry brand ignores the fact that this is not a device that is designed for watching Netflix or playing glorious games (although . Most people I know who own iPhones don't watch Netflix on their iPhones, and most of them write e-mails on their laptops. Case in point.\n\nPros:\n\n-Most apps work great, whether Kindle/Android or native BB. I've downloaded Groupon, Instagram, various photo apps, AirBnb, a banking app, Shazam, NY Times, Wikipedia, Amazon store, a couple of Twitter clients, and it comes with Evernote and a decent note-taking app that can do voice memos as well. I'm having some frustrations with Facebook (native), but it works ok.\n-Size is convenient to hold in your hand, and the classic BB keyboard is great.\n-Ability to take notes during calls, for when a customer service representative gives you that super important phone number.\n-Durable. Feels more durable than any iPhone I've owned and comes with a free rubber+hardshell case.\n-Great battery life. My iPhone will often die before 11am, and this powers through the day even with heavy use. Charging doesn't go so fast, but I guess you can't win 'em all.\n-Call clarity is amazing and the speakerphone is super loud.\n-Swipe-up equivalent of the home button becomes extremely comfortable fairly quickly. I was skeptical at first, having gotten used to the old school BlackBerry buttonry and even the iPhone home button, but it works great and hasn't failed me yet.\n-Fast and not fazed by a multitude of apps and data.\n-Expandable, cheap memory. Comes with 16GB built in and you can get 32GB on top of that for $15 on Amazon.\n-Easy to customize notification settings and it's set up intuitively.\n-Screen is great.\n-When you close out of an app, you automatically see all of the open apps and therefore don't tie up valuable RAM running stuff you're not using (this was a peril on the iPhone).\n-The Hub works alright. I was prepared to hate it, but it's pretty convenient, and it's easy to navigate around to adjust settings, add new accounts, delete accounts, etc. It's sort of like a glorified home screen.\n-Transferring contacts was a breeze, and the OS actually automatically added a TON of stuff that I was glad I had-- notified me, for example, of a meeting I had coming up before I had even transferred anything over (I guess from an e-mail account).\n-NFC stuff is easy to use.\n-The Facebook app is imperfect but lets you conveniently use FB messenger inside the application instead of having to use a different application.\n-Included HDMI port.\n\nCons:\n\n-Special multi-touch gestures aren't quite as advanced as the iPhone, which I find myself lamenting probably a few times a week on random stuff.\n-Included earbuds in headset are absoutely horrendous.\n-Haven't figured out how to set up a good Podcast app.\n-I haven't been able to get absolutely every app to work on this phone, but there are only two that I am going to have to \"sideload,\" those being Uber and Yelp (\"sideload\" = meandering in command prompt slash developer nonsense slash upload download file conversion nonsense).  I think that's a product of BlackBerry having relied on the Amazon Kindle/Fire appstore instead of Google Play. As the fates would have it, the Google Play website doesn't really work very well on the phone's browser, so you're sort of sunk until you figure out how to sideload Android apps-- which isn't quite a piece of cake but also isn't the worst. It's much easier to download apps on the BlackBerry than it was on my old iPhone because I don't have to type in my password every time I download something, so it's easy to try out new apps-- and there are plenty. But really, how many calendar apps do you need?\n-Notification LED, while fully customizable, is pretty weak and only illuminates on the front side as opposed to the linear LED on the Tour/Curve, which sort of sliced through the top of the device so you could see it in a holster or when it was lying flat. I really liked the Tour's function of the lock button an the mute button at the top-- they were hard plastic and easy to access. This has no such thing, just a lock button at the top. Which is fine, because you can easily swipe up to unlock and customize your lock settings (not to mention add hotkeys, which the iPhone lacks in any comparable way).\n-Special function button is inconveniently placed between the volume rocker buttons, making it clumsy and easy to press accidentally or hard to press intentionally. On my Tour it was on the opposite side of the phone, making it great for pushing with your thumb while your index and middle fingers could access the volume buttons.\n-Voice control kind of stinks, but then again, Siri ain't perfect neither. I find that it works okay for voice dictation, but it's very hard to ask your device, for example, where you can get a good meal in Grand Rapids. It's technically good, but not very smart.\n\nOverall, I'm pretty satisfied. Not entirely perfect as far as the not-mainstream app situation is concerned, but that'll get better, and it's great to have a community of die-hard BB fans who are always willing to help on forums like CrackBerry.", "summary": "Affordable and fully-loaded alternative to the expensive flagship phones-- and every bit a BlackBerry", "unixReviewTime": 1433721600}

However, if you're looking to switch from a high-end Android-powered phone or the iPhone, keep reading.\n\nSummary-\nDespite all its surface eye candy (Live tiles, etc), after playing with Lumia 900 for a couple of days I found WP7 to be underwhelming in the usability and customization department. Microsoft's own Skype can NOT run in the background (rendering it useless as an always-on Skype phone). Lack of multiple \"home screens\" make app navigation cumbersome, especially if you have a large number of apps. Small amount of storage (16GB) and lack of memory card slot. Not the best ergonomics and touch interface.\n\nThe review is divided into the following sections-\n\nHardware and Ergonomics\nOS and Metro GUI\nMusic Streaming\nApps and Marketplace\nBackgrounding and Multitasking\nEcosystem\n\nHARDWARE and ERGONOMICS\n\nPros-\n* FM Radio\n* Dedicated \"Back\", Search and Camera buttons\n* Standard Micro-USB port\n* 4G LTE Support\n\nCons-\n* Doesn't have a good grip (slippery)\n* Display- very shiny/glossy, a fingerprint magnet\n* Might be too large for one-handed operation (for those with smaller sized hands)\n* Touch interface a tad sluggish/un-responsive\n* Dedicated \"hard\" buttons aren't customizable\n* Dedicated Search button isn't application- or context-sensitive (only Bing)\n* The phone cannot be unlocked (as of the time of writing)\n* Micro-USB port placement on top (not the best for car dashboard use)\n* Only 16Gb or memory and no memory expansion slots\n* Cannot be un-locked at present (even by ATT)\n\nBOTTOM LINE- if you have large hands, you might like its ergonomics, given you get a nice rubberized case for it. For people with small hands it may not be as convenient. And if you're looking for a lot of storage this isn't the phone to get with only 16GB.\n\nOS and METRO GUI\n\nPros-\n* Live Tiles\n* Windowing system with unified sliding bottom bar and common functions (Add, Remove, Select, etc) and horizontally \"swipe-able\" pages/screens across OS and apps\n* Customizable (pin/unpin and re-arrange) Home Screen\n\nCons-\n* Limited 2-screen interface (i.e. Home Screen and App list)\n* Only one Home Screen (vs. multiple on Android or iOS)\n* App list can get very long and difficult to navigate. Only navigation option is using alphabetical search by app name (implying you have to remember all your app names).\n* Tiles on the App Screen are small and not very distinct/recognizable.\n* No ability to logically group apps/tiles (not without third-party tools anyway)\n* Only 11 accent colors and 2 backgrounds to chose from out of the box\n* Only 3 brightness levels (low, medium, high)+ Auto\n* Limited OS settings and info (for example- lack of WiFi network type/speed)\n* Lack of advanced settings for OS and apps (for example- only five configurable settings for Internet Explorer, no privacy settings besides cookies on/off, etc)\n* Toggles for WiFi, Bluetooth, etc are buried pretty deep. (fortunately there're third-party apps such as Toggle that bring them all to the Home Screen for ease of access.\n\nBOTTOM LINE- if you're using more than a handful of apps, navigation on this phone becomes cumbersome. Very limited customization and configuration settings. This is not a phone for app \"geeks\" and certainly not for those who like to customize their phones.\n\nSide note- it can be jailbroken, but since the Chevron project has been suspended, the only way is by having a developer-unlocked phone (AFAIK). So it really can't be easily jailbroken at present...\n\nMUSIC STREAMING\n\nPros-\n* Bluetooth A2DP for streaming\n* Built-in FM radio (uses headphones as antenna)\n\nCons-\n* No Airplay support\n* Lack of native Pandora client\n\nBOTTOM LINE- Bluetooth is the only wireless streaming option.\n\nAPPS AND MARKETPLACE\n\nPros-\n* Unified expanding bottom bar with application-specific settings and the \"swipe-able\" horizontal tabs/screens\n* Ability to \"try\" apps on the Marketplace before actually buying them\n\nCons-\n* To \"sideload\" any other apps outside of MS Marketplace, the phone has to be jailbroken and as the Chevron project has been suspended, seems that the only way is by having a developer-unlocked phone.\n* Some big omissions in the Marketplace (for example- Pandora, Google Voice, Talkatone, Citibank). There're some third-party equivalents though. Check first if your important apps are available for WP7.\n* Microsoft's own Skype version for WP7 is very basic and way inferior to its iPhone counterpart (for example- the lack of \"Online Contacts\" list, only \"All Contacts\" and \"Recent Contacts\").\n* Skype CANNOT run in the background (known issue). This means no incoming calls if Skype isn't in the foreground.\n\nBOTTOM LINE- while app selection isn't all that extensive, you can try them before buying. Missing Pandora client and half-baked implementation of Skype are inexcusable.\n\nBACKGROUNDING and MULTITASKING\n\nPros-\n* Easy switching between backgrounded apps (by briefly holding Back button)\n\nCons-\n* No ability to add/remove apps to be \"backgrounded\"\n* Lack of configuration settings to change background task behavior.\n* Some apps don't show up in Background Tasks list (e.g. TuneIn)\n* Lack of indication (e.g. a badge) on the app's Live Tile that it's running in the background in the App List or the Home Screen\n* Skype does not run in the background\n\nBOTTOM LINE- Backgrounding on WP7 is very limited and not customizable with some glaring omissions, such as Skype.\n\nECOSYSTEM\n\nI don't believe there's much ecosystem that evolved yet around this phone and WP7. There're only a handful of docks, speakers, and accessories made for this phone besides your general BT accessories.\n\nBOTTOM LINE- if you're invested in an iPhone ecosystem, don't expect anything close to it with Lumia 900/WP7.\n\nTHE BOTTOM BOTTOM LINE- If you're in the market for a phone with good connectivity options (4G LTE) and a pretty GUI that is not iOS or Android, this is it. And with its $99 subsidized price it's probably the best smartphone ever ! However, if you're an app person/tinkerer/power user/jailbreaker- stay away from this phone.", "summary": "Eye candy- nothing more...", "unixReviewTime": 1336953600}

The method of application has also improved somewha, in some protectors.\n\nI have to say that Belkin have really outdone themselves with this package, icorporating the best materiails and procedures I have seen, and with packaging you generally do not see on screen protectors (this looks more like an apple product).

Finally, I've updated the firmware and some software, so I'd like to give a quick update / review on the new changes, because some of the things I mentioned before are no longer accurate.\n\n- Firmware v40.2.005 is great. It's just a slight improvement but good nonetheless. One can update the firmware either through over-the-air (ie. 3G / WIFI) or from a PC. I'd prefer to use Nokia Ovi Suite on a PC to update the firmware because you can backup all your settings / contacts / data. Although updating the firmware is relatively safe, you'd want to do a backup just to be sure.\n\n- Ovi Maps v3.03 is a nice improvement. The interface is about the same. The biggest change is you can download voice guidance that speak street names during navigation. With this update, it really depends on one's usage to think if this phone can replace a dedicated GPS unit. It's getting harder to say now.\n\n- Nokia Email Messaging is Nokia's way of doing Push email. It works pretty well with GMail / Hotmail / Yahoo and I'd assume it works with other email service providers too. It basically syncs all the contents in each email accounts (up to 10). The updated client displays HTML contents which is a significant improvement.\n\nMany new phones (especially Android phones) have come out in the last couple of months. I still think this phone still proposes excellent values with its price and features. Most of all, it's unlocked, and it can be used anywhere in the world, even without a SIM card.\n\nThe phone's user interface remains its Achilles' heel, however. As long as the user finds the phone hard to use, it really doesn't matter if the phone has the best price / features / performance in the market. Most users are using this phone to be more than just a phone. It's a smartphone because the phone is smart, not because it expects a smart user to use the phone.\n\nOriginal Review:\n----------------\nI'll try to keep it short. I'll give the phone 5 stars without hesitiation. Others have provided very good (or bad reviews) of this phone, and mostly they are right-on. The key about this phone is you need to know why you want this phone, and how this phone suit your needs. Do not have an unreasonable expectation. The strength of this phone is its cost vs. feature proposition. In my opinion, there's simply not a phone out there that provides such a rich feature set while costs < $250.\n\nIf you want to buy an iphone (and pay ~$1000 total - $200 for the phone + $720 for 2-year data plan @ $30/month), don't buy this phone. Buy the iphone instead. This phone is not an iphone, not an iphone killer, and not an iphone replacement.\n\nIf you want to buy a Garmin GPS, don't buy this phone. Buy a Garmin GPS instead. This is not a GPS replacement.\n\nIf you want to buy a good quality digital camera, don't buy this phone. Buy a Canon or Nikon. This is not a digital camera replacement.\n\nIf you want to buy a FM radio, don't buy this phone. But who needs a FM radio anyways.\n\nIf you want to buy a music player, actually this phone's music feature is really nice.\n\nWith the above being said, buy this phone if you want an excellent phone AND want to do all of the above without carry all of the above gadgets at the same time. In particular you want:\n\n- a phone that is unlocked, quad-band (international use), no contract, no $30 data-plan, no $10 GPS navigation plan and costs ~$250\n\n- a phone that has strong signal, excellent call quality, and long battery life\n\n- a phone that can play music/video/games, browse the internet, check email, take pictures/videos, provide GPS turn-by-turn drive and walk navigation (North America only) and maps service (global map is free download), provide VOIP video calls (using the 2nd camera in the front) over WIFI (fring and nimbuzz apps are free download) EVEN WITHOUT a sim card (excellent for travel)\n\nSome tips while using this phone:\n\n- the touch screen is a resisitive touch screen (unlike iphone's capacitive touch screen). Do not use your \"finger tip\" to control the touch screen. Use your \"finger nail\" or the included stylus instead. Personally I like \"finger nail\" much better. Once you get used to this, everything is a breeze. If your \"finger nail\" is as sharp (or unsharp) as the included stylus, it will not scratch the screen.\n\n- the user interface takes a while to get used to. The iphone user inteface is more superb (and it's not even close, so I'll give credit where credit is due.) However, the Nokia 5800 features are excellent and there are plenty of supported (and unofficially supported) apps to download. No need to download itunes. No need to wait for Apple certified apps. Basically, you can download whatever you want and do whatever you want with this phone (e.g. use it as a USB storage device), and that's why it's not an iphone.\n\n- speaking of iphone interface - there's a PAID (for money) app out there that you can buy and install iphone-like user interface onto your Nokia 5800. Get that app if you really need the iphone user interface. Just google \"Nokia 5800 myphone app\" and you will find the link and reviews.\n\n- use the GPS without data plan (and do not get charged for data usage) by going to\n\nsettings -> phone -> app. settings -> positioning -> positioning methods and check only \"Internal GPS\".\n\nThe GPS without data plan may take up 5 mins (or more) to acquire a lock. The GPS signal is weaker than a dedicated GPS unit, and the voice navigation does not speak street names. That's why it's not a GPS replacement, but a GPS capable phone that you can use while a dedicated GPS unit is not available.\n\n- browse the internet and check email using WIFI. Make sure you don't get charged for extra data usage by going to\n\nsettings -> connectivity -> destinations -> Internet (or MMS or WAP) -> \"Your service provider\" and make sure \"use access point\" is set to \"after confirmation\".\n\nIt's annoying that you will keep getting asked if you allow internet connection, but you'll get the peace of mind that you'll never accidentally connect to the cellular data network.\n\n- visit Chinese (Traditional or Simplified) / Japanese / Korean websites by downloading \"Opera Mobile with Asian Language Support\" (not the regular Opera Mobile, not Opera Mini). Just google it and you will find the link.\n\n- take pictures / videos while outdoor and with good lighting. Poor picture / videos quality is expected for any camera phone when taking them indoor with poor lighting. The phone flash does not help. That's why it's not a digital camera replacement, but a phone with camera that can use during social outings (e.g. Facebook Mobile upload).\n\nSome nice to have (but not required) for this phone:\n\n- get a data-plan if your service provider has a cheap alternative compared to the standard $30 smartphone data-plan. Being able to browse the internet and check email anywhere without WIFI is very convenient. Plus, the GPS / maps include additional features like traffic, weather, additional point-of-interests update that require a data-plan. More plus, with data-plan, you can turn on A-GPS (assisted GPS), which allows the GPS to acquire a lock in less than 30 seconds and to maintain a much stronger GPS signal throughout.\n\nAnd most of all enjoy your phone while you are sitting somewhere nice, like a coffee shop. People, do everyone a favor - DO NOT USE YOUR PHONE (TALK OR TEXT) while driving.\n\nHope my review helps.", "summary": "Understand what you're buying with Nokia 5800", "unixReviewTime": 1262822400}

I live in a basement and have virtually no service. I rely on wi-fi calling, but with Time Warner, wi-fi is not very reliable and often drops calls when there is a blip in the signal. I needed to improve service so I gave this a shot (I bought it used so I didn't get directions). I tried placing the window unit at several different windows and the smaller unit in several different spots. The best I could get is a 7-8 signal, which is good. The problem is my phone doesn't always get the boost when I need it. Looking at my phone right now, I only have 2 bars, but if I move around a little (close to the smaller unit) I can usually get it up to 5 bars. The main issue is that if I get an incoming call when the signal is weak, I might not be able to get an improved signal even if I move around.\n\nOverall, it was definitely worth it for me. I have MetroPCS and no service in the basement. I used to have verizon and never had a problem, but couldn't stand wasting money anymore. Now I have decent service and I couldn't be happier. Even if it doesn't boost it 100% of the time, it does boost it at least 85% of the time, which works for me.

I've used the Note 4 for most of the past year, and the 6Plus for over 4 months. Both have great features, great screens, but both are clearly overpriced for what they offer.\n\nHere's a quick comparison between those two and the new Moto X Pure:\n\nScreen:\nNote 4 - average brightness, intense colors, sharp, over saturated, great viewing angles, deep blacks, but with terribly yellowed whites. Considered the 2nd best screen on the planet after the Note 5. But I greatly dislike it. Colors aren't real, reading black text against yellow white isn't pleasant. 518PPI.\niPhone 6 Plus - bright, clean, sharp, well balanced, great viewing angles, not so good blacks, TRUE whites. 441PPI. (BEST FOR ME)\nMoto X Pure - bright, clean, sharp, well balanced, worst viewing angles, not so good blacks, less yellow than Note 4, but not as white as iPhone. 520 PPI. Aside from the viewing angles (not important for how we actually use a phone - by looking straight at it), it is a terrific screen.\n\nBody:\nNote 4 - ugly, fake leather, sharp edges, scratch magnet on the edges, capacitive buttons, protruding camera breaks EASILY, easy to  hold, body to screen ratio is good, perfect thickness. Ugly home button.\niPhone 6 Plus - ugly body, TOO THIN - doesn't feel substantial, slippery, protruding camera, large bezels on top and bottom, extra large phone for a smaller screen. Ugly home button.\nMoto X Pure Edition - excellent screen to body ratio, easy to hold, a bit on the thicker side but it actually feels nice. On and volume buttons perfectly placed. No home button as the phone KNOWS when you approach it or pick it up to use it.\n\nBattery:\nNote 4 - 10-15 hours + extra battery - BEST\niPhone 6 Plus - 10-15 hours\nMoto X Pure Edition - 6-10 hours\n\nOperating System:\nNote 4 - TouchWiz Android - Slow, laggy, obtrusive, filled with useless features, only gets worse the more you use the phone. Slow updates or NO updates from Samsung or Carrier. Terrible Support.\niPhone 6 Plus - iOS - Fast, responsive, always up to date, no lag, no slow downs, clean interface, unbeatable support! Great features by apple software.\nMoto X Pure Edition - Pure Android - FAST, RESPONSIVE, always up to date, NO LAG, no slow downs, no slow down due to extended usage based on older models, support by Motorola isn't the best based on other reviews; if you buy it from best buy or Amazon and insure the device through them, it should be better. Great, useful features by Motorola Software.\n\nFeatures:\nNote 4 - Pen is phenomenal and works as advertised. Camera is one of the BEST in a smartphone, but it's slow to launch, sometimes taking up to 10 seconds, and you can't review the photo you just took because opening gallery will usually FREEZE the whole phone. Happens often enough! No manual controls. Remote control feature is great. MicroSD. Fast charging. NFC. Low volume output through the earphones.\niPhone 6 Plus - excellent camera. FAST, FAST, responsive, always there when you need it. No manual controls. Very slow charging. Excellent volume output and sound quality via headphones.\nMoto X Pure Edition - excellent camera, FAST, responsive, can be launched FAST by twitching your arm twice. MicroSD. Fastest charging available. Excellent volume output and sound quality via headphones.\n\nOverall:\nNote 4 - SAY NO to Samsung. Until they make a phone with a decent, fast, reliable OS, don't buy it. It kills the experience. TOO EXPENSIVE.\niPhone 6 Plus - excellent phone. It does everything WELL. It is always responsive and reliable. TOO EXPENSIVE.\n\nMoto X Pure Edition - Excellent phone. It does everything WELL. FANTASTIC Price. Right now, there's nothing that beats this phone for its price. Excellent screen, design, great camera, fantastic OS and software.

I've been using it for a week or so and have powered/charged my two Kindles, iPad3, iPhone4, Samsung camcorder and Sansa mp3 players. It will work with a large variety of devices that are able to be powered/charged via USB.\n\nThe Yubi Power Bank comes with 4 tips and a short USB cable which the various tips plug in to. You are also able to use your device specific USB cable if you wish.\n\nThe tips that are included are: psp, 30-pin Apple connector, mini-USB and micro-USB.\n\nThe Power Bank is charged using a micro-USB connector that can be plugged in to a USB port of your computer or an AC-USB charger. Charging the Power Bank will be faster if it is charged using an AC-charger since the amperage will be higher. It is capable of being charged using up to 1A.\n\nThe Power Bank also has a LED flashlight which is activated  or turned off by a quick double-press of the on/off button. The double-press is a good feature as it prevents accidental flashlight activation. On a full-charge, the flashlight will operate roughly 250 hours.\n\nThe Power Bank input is 5V DC at 0.5-1A\nOurput is 5V DC, 1A maximum.\n\nThe Power Bank offers protection against over charging, excessive voltage, excessive current and short circuit protection.\n\nA 6-month warranty rounds out this nice little battery pack.\n\nThis is a very convenient, compact and useful battery pack. About the only feature I wish it had would be a complete auto-off function. As it is right now, you have to manually depress the on/off button for 3-seconds to completely power down the battery pack to eliminate battery drain when not in use. Other than that, it's great in every respect.", "summary": "Compact sized 5200 mAh battery charger is great", "unixReviewTime": 1353369600}

Bustos", "reviewText": "First off I would like to say that I received this product as a free sample for review by uNu through their uTry program.  While I am glad I received this free, I would gladly pay for one if I ever lost this one.  I really can't say enough good things about this case.  For my birthday earlier this year my son gave me a Mophie charging case (in purple, the only thing I still love about that case) for my iPhone which I used, but soon regretting using.  It was bulky, a bit slippery, somewhat hard to take apart, and the worst part is that I had to fight with the case each time I wanted to sync with my computer (yes, I know I can sync wirelessly but I like to put my pictures into a file on my computer for backup and the easiest way is connecting it to my computer).  That was pretty much the deal breaker; when my son bought a different uNu model for his phone and told me he could sync to his computer with the case ON the jealousy set in.  I looked up uNu and on their website found out about the uTry program.\n\nWhen I received the case, the first thing I noticed is the \"Made for iPhone\" label on the box.  It is packaged very nicely, and easy to take out.  After struggling to get my phone out of the Mophie case, putting it into this case was a dream.  It slid right into the back, and then the bumper was quite easy to attach.  I did have to go through and press various parts of the bumper to make sure everything clicked into place.  Once it was clicked together, it was hard to pry it apart again.  I was having some issued with the power button; I couldn't always get it to press properly.  After prying the case apart I noticed that the button on the case only has a piece on the outer part of the button.  If you press it on the inner part then it won't do anything, but if you press it on the outer part (close to the edge of the phone) then it will easily press the phone's button.\n\nI love the blue of the lights in the back, though I did have to read the instructions to figure out how to get the case to start charging (you have to hold the button for a few seconds).  I was very surprised by how thin this case is; it almost feels like there's nothing on the phone even though I can tell it is a bit thick by looking at the camera cutout.  The rubbery texture also makes it easy to grip and you don't feel like the phone is going to slide out of your hand or off the table.  Being able to just place the phone down on the charging pad, without having to plug something into it, makes this case more than worthwhile.  The best part for me is that I can connect it to any micro USB cable on my computer and it automatically syncs!  I haven't dropped it yet and don't plan to (the Mophie did do well in that department in that when I dropped my phone the case had some dings and a crack but my phone was fine) so I can't attest to how well it does in that department.\n\nOverall this is the best case I've ever had for a phone, and I've had many.  I was able to charge my phone to about 90% from a 10% charge, which is better than what I got with the Mophie.  The only negative thing I can think of with this case is that it does not come in purple (or any other colors), NOT a deal breaker.  If any issues come up I will be sure to edit my review.  Another thing I noticed with this case: when charging from the case the phone only gets mildly warm, as opposed to burning hot with the Mophie.  This case is well worth the cost!", "summary": "Hands down the best case for your phone!", "unixReviewTime": 1402012800}

Using this with a Galaxy Note 3, generic 1 amp battery pack, and Poweradd Compact Carmate3 400A Peak Current Car Jump Starter and 4000mAh Power Bank in Arizona.\nI used the Ampere app to get an approximate idea of the charging output of the Aukey.\nFor the Note 3 when I charge my phone from a regular source (wall outlet, high output USB), the phone draws 1200 ma.  When I plug the phone into the Aukey under full sunlight, the app shows I'm getting a full 1200 ma charge.  So that works great for the phone.  The generic battery pack only needs a 500 ma input to charge and the Aukey charges it fully in a couple of hours.  The Poweradd Compact Carmate3 400A Peak Current Car Jump Starter and 4000mAh Power Bank uses a micro USB to charge and so only requires 500 ma input as well.  But it normally takes a long time even plugged into a wall socket and while the Aukey does charge it, I was finding that if direct sunlight is not maintained constantly then the charging fluctuation tends to really slow down the process.  Which means that the battery pack I would want to count on for the highest recharge of my electrical components might not actually charge fully before the last sunlight of the day.  I would get at least a partial charge.  So the Aukey for me in Arizona works great.  But it would be a good idea to be realistic about the time it's going to take to give a meaningful charge to more heavy duty battery packs.  It should work well with most high drain phones though.\nThe only reason I took off one star, was not quality or function, but mostly versatility.  I happily discovered I could get the full 1200 ma output even through house glass flat against the glass.  In many outdoor situations you can carry it on a pack and get full charging (given direct sunlight).  But it is also sometimes just as useful to be out and be able to have the solar panel on the dash charging whatever electronics from the inside where those items can be locked up.  For whatever reason the windshield glass will block full charging enough that it's just about worthless.  That's a very specific environment so I don't want to take away too much from how good the charger is, but at the same time that's a situation that would come up often that the user may want and it won't work.  The manufacturer does not advertise that the charger is UV dependent (which is what I'm assuming is the issue) so no fault there.  It's disappointing though.  That means that the in outdoor situations the charger is limited then to backpack only or you'll have to be in a position to watch it if worried about theft.\nOtherwise the design of the device is nice.  The attachment points are many and tough.  The panels themselves are very sturdy and appear weather resistant.  I don't think that means much since the connector outlets and little storage mesh (for battery packs) definitely are not weather resistant.  You would not be able to leave this outside a tent in the rain (why would you?) because I'm sure the connector box would just fry with any water.\nAlso the mesh pocket in the back is a nice bonus great for carrying any battery pack and cables.  But in order for the charger to fold and store nicely, if you leave a battery pack in it, the battery pack will have to be small or very thin.  Otherwise a thick battery pack will give the folded panels quite a pronounced hump and be difficult to store.", "summary": "Great solar panel works as described well.

I recently purchased a Sony Xperia Z3, and like I always do with my phones, I purchased a wallet case. I've reviewed a few others for the Samsung Galaxy SIII (my old phone) and one of those I loved and one of them I hated.\n\nThis one I love. It looks beeeeaaaauuutiful. Seriously, when I opened it up and popped my phone in, I was instantly satisfied. Yes, the leather isn't perfect but it fits the bill remarkably well. It looks professional and clean and keeps the profile slim just like the Xperia Z3. The magnetic clip that keeps the case closed is great and I can even bend the case back onto itself to stand the phone. It's great.\n\nThe hands down best feature here though is the system that holds your phone in place. Seriously, folks: What makes or breaks a wallet case is how the actual phone is held. I've had wallet cases that holds the phone cheaply, firmly, too firmly, flimsy, rough and loose and let me tell you, this one is perfect. What you want is the case to hold the phone but not make it impossible to remove but you also don't want the phone slip or slide out. This one lands smack in the middle and again, it's wonderful. I can easily remove my phone if need be and when it's in place, it feels stable and sturdy.\n\nMy one tiny, itty-bitty draw back is with the card holders. They are not stacked. What I mean is that the top most card (there are 3 slots) can slide all the way down to behind the first and lowest card holding slot. Which means you could have a card slip all the way down and be extremely difficult to retrieve. Now, I won't remove a star for this because the slots themselves are fairly snug. This means your cards shouldn't slip and slide too much. However, when that top card slides, and eventually it will, it could be something that absolutely infuriates you.\n\nRegardless, this is still, hands down, a great purchase. I intend to buy the other colors as I'm sure I will beat this one to H and back.", "summary": "Absolutely Wonderful", "unixReviewTime": 1418256000}

I'm writing second impressions now, but will travel with it for a while to see if my view changes.\n\nThe box is easy to open without damaging, and is secure.  Internal packaging is foam, to prevent damage in shipping.  All of the printing is clear, proper English, though some of the wording is awkward for US or UK speakers.\n\nThe device is a small brick with embedded output cables, one on each side, plus an input microUSB port.  The built in output cables include one for lightning, and one for microUSB.  The cables are not replaceable if they become damaged or are too short.\n\nIt's rated at 3.7V and 5000mAh.  That's overstating capacity a bit.  Realistically, it contains two 18650 cells inside.  That means 2200mAh, times 2 cells at 3.7V or 16.2Wh.  That's 3 charges of an iPhone 5s if you turn off the phone while charging.  It puts out 5V at 1A, so it'll keep up with a phone, but if you're using GPS, with the screen on, and playing music, then expect the Skiva 5000 to be drained by the time your phone gets a full charge from empty.  If you're playing a really intense game, it might just hold your power even.\n\nThe input cable is microUSB, and comes separately.  The build is similar to an Apple brand cable, with just enough texture to not be slippy.  There's strain relief on the USB side, but not the micro side.\n\nThe built in micro-USB output cable end is very small, and should fit through any case.  The built-in lightning cable has a very large end.  I have to take the case off of any of my devices to make it work.  It's the biggest cable end of any lightning cables I've ever seen.  There is a loose, rubber bumper for the cable to dock into, implying there may be other options for the non-micro port in the future.\n\nIf you plug in the input cable and output cable at the same time, it will wake up and pass-through power for the output cable while charging the Skiva battery.  While charging, there are 4 blue lights on the top that will blink from \"all\" to \"some\" showing how far is left to charge.  Power is not regulated, so when one LED goes on, some of the others go more dim.\n\nThe angle and length of the output cables are such that you cannot pocket the charger and your phone while connected.  The cable is also too short to set the PowerVault down, and pick up the phone.  The casing of the device is curved, so it doesn't fit snugly against the back of a flat device for holding both at the same time.  This is designed to be used on a desk or table while the phone is not in use.  It might be okay in a purse or backpack, but not a pocket or your hand.\n\nThe first unit I received failed to charge devices for more than 15 seconds at a time.  A quick visit to their office near my house, and it was swapped out for a working unit.  This was from a sealed box, not a cherry-picked unit, so I think the failed unit was just a random issue that was missed by QA.\n\nThey noticed my review AND emailed me quickly about it with both suggestions, and an offer to swap out the faulty unit.  That's promising, though it was their marketing director vs normal support.  YMMV, but I have other Skiva products that work great, including ones I bought a few years ago, before they contacted me.\n\nThe device arrived at half charge, which is a good thing for storage/longevity of LiIon batteries.  There is a button that briefly powers up 0-4 blue LED lights to indicate current charge, then they turn off after 5 seconds.\n\nIt's not my favorite unit, but it *IS* compact.

These Riversong VR goggles feature a smart design, they are comfortable, they accommodate a wider-than-normal range of devices, and are a very good value for their relatively low price point (currently about $25, although I got mine for free in return for a fair and honest review).  Overall, I can highly recommend them.\n\n******************\n*** PROS ***\n******************\n\n- Comfortable for many head sizes (comfortable + highly adjustable head strap, comfortable spongy material around the eyes)  Comfort is a main negative in reviews of other goggles, and it really matters, so these were a happy surprise in that respect.\n\n- Not as heavy as come goggles (...which means that these are less likely to slip forward and/or to the side)\n\n- Can fit more types / sizes of devices than most 3D goggle designs, with or without cases.  This model could fit my small iPod 5 and my 6.5\" phone, both with and without their cases (although were less likely to jiggle around with the case on, which I prefer anyway, because it saves a step). My iPod case even has a belt clip attached to it, so it is extra thick; I could still pop in these and it clipped in securely.  Overall, it is an IMPRESSIVE DESIGN in terms of how it holds in all different kinds of devices, which can be important.\n\n- The Riversong goggles have more blackout around the sides than most, which can matter a good deal when your device is smaller than the opening.  Your device will rarely be the exact same size as your goggles.  But the fact that the back of these goggles is pretty dark to start with (and even darker when you put in the black insert behind it) means that smaller devices do not end up with a bright, distracting rim around the outside of them in a bright space.\n\n- There is room for headphones to be plugged in, with a hole in each side of the goggles (though if your headphone jack is not at one of the ends of your device, it might not work as well or at all.)  Better yet, use Bluetooth headphones.  Note that no headphones are included with this product; you have to use your own.\n\n**********************************\n*** UNABLE TO EVALUATE ***\n**********************************\n\n- The packaging makes it look like you can use these as 3D goggles in a movie theater, but I haven't had a chance to try that yet.\n\n- I haven't used them for gaming (I usually use them watch short news clips and artistic videos via the New York Times VR app on my device)\n\n**************\n*** CONS ***\n**************\n\n- The instructions are better than some that come with similar devices (i.e., they have some, and they do say a few helpful things about adjustments), but they are still more limited than they need to be.  For example, how to use the black insert is not entirely clear.\n\n- The adjustments for nearsightedness and 3D distance are there (which is important, do not get goggles without those), however, they aren't endless.  They are as good as any goggles I have seen so far, but (as with all goggles, it still takes me several minutes of watching to get the two images to merge into one.)\n\n**************************************************************\n*** FOOD FOR THOUGHT when buying any 3D goggles ***\n**************************************************************\n\n- It is important to understand that nearly all (all?) of the glasses/goggles at this price point are not connected to your your phone / iPod / etc.; instead, your phone just sits inside of these glasses/goggles.  Your phone/device runs the app, and you run your own earphones through your device, not through the goggles.  The goggles are basically just a comfortable \"hat\" and holder for your own technology, rather than providing any electronic functionality of their own.  So if you do not see your own particular device listed as being compatible with these googles, that really doesn't matter; just compare the size of your device with the devices listed, and if you are roughly in the same general ballpark, you should be fine.\n\n- As I mentioned above, it happens to take my eyes a few minutes to adjust to all 3D goggles I have tried so far.  Despite how I adjust (any) VR goggles, I just keep seeing two images instead of one until my eyes and brain suddenly start communicating.  My optometrist has suggested that some people's eyes  are less adaptable to transitions, whether it is with reference to using progressive glasses, bifocal contacts, or 3D / VR devices, and he has politely implied that I am one of the non-adaptable kinds of people.  It can be kind of a hassle for me with VR as it currently stands, because most VR experiences (aside from video games) are pretty short; as such, once I get visually adapted, the film tends to be basically over.  And once I take it out and start a new video, I then have another (usually briefer) adaption period again.\n\nAll that is just to say that A) that isn't the fault of the goggles (though I do hold out hope that I might be able to try a fancier pair with more adjustments; I don't know if that would make a difference or not); B) you might want to temper your expectations that you will personally adapt to the technology quickly.\n\nEither way, it is worth noting that I tend to adapt more quickly by looking way over my left and right shoulders, and back again, until I can get the two images to merge into one.\n\n*********************\n*** TIPS TO TRY ***\n*********************\n\n--- Try the NYT VR (New York Times Virtual Reality) app.  It has a few mind-blowingly cool short news & artistic VR videos on it.  Tons of fun!\n\n--- Do not forget to turn around, look up to the sky, and look down at your feet.  That is what is totally amazing about VR, but it usually takes people a few minutes to figure out that you have all of those options.\n\nVR is phenomenal technology that everyone should try in some way, whether it is with cardboard goggles, with these, or with a super fancy Occulus Rift!\n\n*******************************\n***  BOTTOM LINE  ***\n*******************************\n\nThese are as good as any 3D goggles I have tried near this point point, and have much to recommend them.\n\nI personally hold out hope that I will find a pair at some point that offers more adjustment options that might potentially allow me to adapt more quickly to the technology when I put them on. But because A) I do not think it is necessary for most people, and B) it isn't really reasonable to expect that level of technology at this modest price point, this is still a \"5 star\" level product that I can highly recommend.\n\n=== Amazon Customer Review of a Free or Discounted Sample Product Provided for Reviewing Purposes ===", "summary": "OUTSTANDING, very comfortable 3D / VR goggles, at an impressively modest price", "unixReviewTime": 1461110400}

This case is so stylish and protective at the same time! That is really my favorite part about this case. I have the gold galaxy s6 edge and the phone already looks amazing and the case just adds to that because you can see the phone through the back of the case! On the back, there is the typical UAG branding and case layout with patterns. The power and volume button and very easy to press and feel really clicky and great. Case won't add a lot of bulk to your phone like an Otter Box and in my opinion, they are even better than otter box cases because they last longer and use better technology versus bulking to protect.\n\nThis is a one piece case and goes on pretty easily with a tight fit. I dropped my phone out of my pocket at around 4 feet high and it was perfectly fine without a screen protector or anything. One feature I really like is the skid pads that are on the bottom. I think they make a big difference for when your phone is on a flat surface, it keeps it raised so it won't get scratches. Also it helps if you drop you phone and it slides or falls on its back.\n\nEveryone with a s6 edge would be safe with this case unless you are purposely are trying to break your phone or drop it from high heights. It provides great protection with great looks.\n\nLike I said earlier, I would definitely choose this over an otterbox because of better technology and better lasting products and material.\n\nOverall, I am very happy with this case, I use it everyday and have no problems. It looks great, feels great, and protects great. Also if you do not like the Ash color option, they have the ice color option. This is a definite buy and I would recommend it to all users.\n\nI was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promise that my review is fair and honest.", "summary": "Military Grade Approved!", "unixReviewTime": 1439251200}

You're not talking about a $250 Verizon model or an iPhone here, folks.  It's a $29.95 (retail), plastic, BASIC, no-thrills, cell phone.  Frankly, it's amazing that for that price you can get something with a color LCD screen that actually gets cell receptions at all.  So my 4-star rating is based on the features and quality of this phone FOR THE PRICE.\n\nI use Verizion as my main cell provider, but sometimes I like to sell things on Craig's List or Ebay and want to have a way for people to contact me if they have questions about something I'm selling.  I do not however, want to give them my main cell number.  So I got this Net10 phone for that specific purpose - as a more anonymous way of communicating with strangers who I don't know, who call to ask about products.  For that, it's great.\n\nWhile plastic, overall the phone is pretty sturdy except perhaps for the upper battery door area with is somewhat \"creeky\" when you hold the camera and press in (it gives, slightly).  The buttons are small and yes, you can accidentally press two at one if you have sausage fingers, but a small amount of paying attention will solve this - it's not designed to be a hard-core \"texting\" phone, and for that, you should buy a phone with a full keyboard.  They do glow a pleasant Blue color when in use, by the way - another minor but amazing feature at this price. The LCD screen though lower resolution, works fine enough for what it is.  The reception is excellent, actually being better than my LG Dare when indoors.  The ear speaker is just a bit fuzzy, making folks sound like they're talking through a cloth - but still not super bad.  People I talk to say the microphone is great, and they can hear me clearly.  No camera, no 3D video games, no multi-phase transporter... sorry.... not for $29.95!\n\nMy only real complaint?  You use your minutes when you check voice mail.  Maybe I'm being cheap, but I figure if you're just calling in to check messages, they should charge a flat 5-cent or 10-cent rate for the entire call, and not a \"per minute\" charge for it.  So if you tend to ignore calls and let a lot of them to go voice mail, keep this in mind as just checking your messages frequently WILL use your minutes.\n\nOk, now, I do have to say that I would NOT use this or any cheap prepaid phone as a full time cell phone.  I'm one of those people who feel that cheap plastic and cell signals do equal radioactivity in your brain.  So I prefer to get something built substantially better if I'm going to talk for hours a month on it.  Likewise, if I had teens, I probably wouldn't want to fry their brains ahead of time by letting them use a device such as this as much as they do.  But for occasional use, and for people who don't LIVE on their cell phones (yes, those people still exist), I think this represents a great value for the price.", "summary": "Keywords:  \"For The Price\", and for that, it's great.", "unixReviewTime": 1243123200}

I was so hopeful it would turn out well and was so relieved yet excited when it did. I am using this on my iphone 5s.\n\nInside the case is an embedded plastic enclosure you insert the phone into and it molds around the phone and holds it securely. That part works perfectly and I haven't had a problem. If anything, getting the phone OUT of that part of the case is a little difficult. That rubberized plastic case is very well secured to the outer shell, which is also hard and sturdy. That part is covered by the leather-like material with the print of the cute couple on both sides. There is a separate clasp which folds over the case and is magnetic. The magnet is strong yet easy to lift up. The back of this case folds outward (away from you) and can be propped up, which does work well if you like to watch things on your phone, and sets up well on both hard and soft surfaces. Once the case is opened there are some slots for cards, and a lot towards the spine for cash. The fabric creating these slots is also the leather-like material and stitched evenly and securely and lined with plastic on the inside of the material, making for a good place to stash a couple of things within the case.\n\nThe only drawback to this case is the sleep button on the iphone 5s, located in the upper right hand corner, is somewhat difficult to reach through the thickness of the inner case. This is a somewhat \"girly\" case, so in my head I imagine using your fingernail to hit the sleep button, but that's a bit of an annoying thing to have to do especially since I always sleep my phone in between flurries of texts with my husband. The alternative is using a pen. The indention in the case is fairly shallow but I am used to my old Lifeproof case, in which there is a responsive spring like mechanism covered by a layer of silicone so that, when in the case, the sleep button is raised up outside of the surface of the outer case. For me, that the sleep button is now indented is cause for some annoyance, because I'm used to just running my finger over it and tossing my phone back on the desk or bed.\n\nNow, more than half them time, I find I never slept the phone or dimmer the screen, and since this case closes like a book, I don't know just by glancing at it, if the screen was dimmed correctly. So then I have to pick the phone back up, open the case, look for light, then slip my fingernail into the indention and \"make sure.\" Since my phone is jailbroken, I installed a tweak that allows me to just swipe across the top of the screen to sleep it when I'm done with whatever, and bypass the sleep button completely. I can see this being an annoyance for some people though. For me, it's just a preference and since the indention is so slight, it's not a cause to pull a star off the review just because it's not what I personally prefer.\n\nOther than that, I love the dandelions and the cute design. The artwork is right up my alley and is simple yet romantic. While I received a discount on the product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I actually like the case so much aside from the sleep button issue I will buy more cases from Shimu because overall the artwork, stitching, material and design are top-notch for the base price and the perfect design for me.", "summary": "Great Artwork, Secure Inner Shell, Perfect Level of Magnetism on Closure - My Favorite 5s Vanity Case!", "unixReviewTime": 1442880000}

My wallet goes everywhere with me same as my phone just like most people. For me, I rotate between my purse and a diaper bag. It has always been easier to use a small clutch to hold my cards, money etc. My phones have never really fit so I always carried that separate which is why I am always misplacing it! With having both combined into one, I haven't lost it yet! During the work week I carry my wallet in my purse but in the evenings and weekends I am always with a diaper bag. The wallet is about 5.5 x 2.5 so I can throw it in the bag and be ready to go! With it being a phone case my phone is secure and not getting beat up like it usually does floating around in my purse or diaper bag.\nThis wallet has 9 card slots for all my important credit/debit cards, insurance cards, pictures etc. The card slots are nice because my cards actually fit and I don't struggle to pull cards/ID out of the slots. I am sure everyone has had that wallet that takes forever to pull your ID out simply because the slots are the exact size of the cards. With this wallet I haven't had any complaints there! I saw all the different colors, but I went with black. I like the feel and look of the leather like black. Perfect for going out when you're not using any type of purse/bag and the baby is not with you! The black looks dressy enough to go with anything you are wearing. Again, it is perfect because it is still small and you can take it with you just like a small hand purse or clutch.\nAt first, I wasn't sure if I liked that the phone was really on held by a magnet, but turns out to be a great feature. It is easily accessible to take pictures or to talk on the phone. You still can take pictures why it is in the case but it is simple to remove if you need too.\nI will say it is nice having the card side vs the section where you phone is placed is separated and each side has a button so your cards are very secure. Nothing is falling out! I am used to having a zipper but the button has worked just fine.\nI received this product at a discount in exchange for my personal, honest review.", "summary": "Great wallet for anyone!", "unixReviewTime": 1455580800}

My otterbox is in pretty sad shape and maybe I would not notice as much drag on the silicone with a new case, but it could be a concern.

It is glued to the screen protector and you can not peel if off without leaving pieces of the paper and glue residue behind which ruins the screen protector. I tried 2 out of the 3 screen protectors and had the same issue and I gave up.

I've used a number of portable battery packs and OXA includes some very nice features to go along with the expected functionality.\n\nThe OXA Juice Box S1 has a 7,800mAh capacity - which is enough to charge my iPad 2 completely or I can charge my cell phone phone several times or I can charge my phone and a friend or colleague can charge their phone at the same time. Because there are two USB OUT charging ports (one 1A and one 2A), you can charge two devices simultaneously.\n\nThe Juice Box is about the size of a deck of cards, but a little thicker. It's made of glossy black plastic and has chrome trim around the sides. The black plastic picks up fingerprints like crazy so if that bugs you, don't buy this. It has 4 blue LED lights underneath the power button which tell you roughly how much juice is left. FYI: The next gen Juice Box (the S2) has a somewhat larger battery capacity, a digital read out of the percentage of battery life left, and an extra mini USB tip, but features the same premium Samsung battery cells.\n\nOXA also included a flashlight for getting your key in the door after dark, finding a pen in your purse, etc. It doesn't put out a lot of light but for tasks like I mentioned, it's fine. To turn the flashlight on and off, push the power button twice in quick succession.\n\nThe Juice Box S1 also comes with a USB charging cable which accepts multiple tips for charging different devices. Included are a mini USB tip, a micro USB tip, a 30-pin old style Apple tip and an 8-pin new style Apple lightning tip. Of course, you can also use your own USB charging cables with this battery pack. There is also a microfiber cleaning cloth, a lined velour carrying pouch and an unusable owner's manual (more on this later).\n\nIn testing this and a few other portable battery packs, I have been using it once daily for about a month, which is more than I might in normal usage. It has performed reliably in charging both my cell phone and two different tablets, along with Bluetooth speakers and headsets. I charged a different item on each battery pack every night - rotating through the various cell phones, tablets, speakers and hand held gaming systems I have in my house. I do notice that it is somewhat slower to charge than some other battery packs I have used, but it's not so much so that it is a problem.\n\nMy only big complaint is the owner's manual. This thing is unbelievably small with print that is so tiny, I couldn't read it. Personally, I find this ridiculous and I hope that OXA reads this and decides to remedy the problem. A folded-up Xerox copy in a readable size would be so much better than this tiny color manual. Save yourself some grief - enlarge and print this manual on your printer or at the local Kinko's if you want to use it. It's the only way you'll read it comfortably.\n\nFortunately, portable battery packs are all pretty similar so you can figure out how to use it without the manual. So despite the manual, this is a good buy on a solid battery pack. I give it 4.5 stars - I knocked off 1/2 a star for the pitiful manual.\n\nNOTE: I was provided a sample for reviewing purposes but a positive review was neither promised or implied.", "summary": "Works as it's supposed to and has some nice extras", "unixReviewTime": 1396310400}

Initial impression was very positive. The cables are significantly thicker than the other cables I own, such as those by Cable Matters and AIFFECT. See the comparison photo I uploaded. I assumed that must be due to the heavy-gauge wires used inside. In my testing, those cables worked well in charging all my USB devices, including Samsung Galaxy S5 and Amazon Fire tablet.\n\nFast forward a few months later: most of those cables I used regularly have developed intermittent charging problems. At first I thought maybe the problem could be from the host devices. But after swapping multiple cables between multiple devices, I have to conclude that the problem is with those Aukey USB cables.\n\nI spliced open one bad cable in an attempt to identify the root cause. The wires inside were indeed heavy-gauge, and they were soldered correctly to the plug. The real problem is from the cheaply made micro-USB plugs. The electrical contacts inside appear to have become flattened and hence not making proper contact with the host device.\n\nIn contrast, the thinner Cable Matters cables&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/here/dp/B00JLTUSEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">(here)</a>&nbsp;purchased earlier in Sep 2015 are still working correctly.

Those Aukey USB cables appear to be thick and sturdy outside, but one by one they all failed within a few months of light use. I am thoroughly disappoint by this product and cannot recommend it.\n\nIf you are looking for USB cable with better construction quality, get the AIFFECT High Speed Micro USB Cables instead.", "summary": "Cables looked sturdy, but micro-USB connectors failed within a few months", "unixReviewTime": 1497398400}

After about a day or two the speaker began to make funny noises on it's own, while powered off, and upside down still to let the water drain.  I moved it to another room so it could exorcise it's demons and assumed it was fried.  A few days later I decided to see if it would turn on.

The ClickGo Sports Running Armband comes in 3 sizes; 5.2 inch, 5.7 inch, 6.3 inch.  You should get a size larger than your phone.  I am testing the ClickGo with my 5.5\" Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and it fit...with a little space for the advertised \"storage for key & card\".  You will be storing any credit cards, cash and key(s) in the back of phone in the pouch.\n\nConstruction seems pretty good to me.  The armband features some material design on the side that contacts your skin, which I think aids in gripping your skin when sweaty.  The armband features 2 reflective strips, one on the armband and one at the zipper pull, I think very well designed because you can use the phone pouch as a separate case if need be.  You can separate the phone pouch from the band for ease of use.  And touchscreen responsiveness doesn't seem to be negatively affected in anyway, since I can still swipe on my Galaxy S7 Edge.\n\nI have 18\" muscular arms and can only really use the armband at the very bottom of my upper arm.  I would be unable to use this armband any higher than at the crux of my arm bend.\n\nThe ClickGo Sports Running Armband in the 5.7\" size is perfect for our 5.5\" phones and provides enough stretch for a slim case or other accessories.", "summary": "Pretty good armband", "unixReviewTime": 1471824000}

If I could give this case 10 stars I would.  Who would think that military grade is really military grade in a consumer market.  So here is my testimonial that I witnessed myself firsthand.  My son has an iphone and he left it on the dash as we were headed out of town for a long weekend.  I had to stop for gas in Sarasota and we were in a bit of a hurry.  We were leaving the gas station at the intersection of Fruitville and Cattleman (see picture) and my son had rolled down the window.  As I was turning East to get back on Interstate 75, his cell phone slid out of the window into the middle of the intersection.  When I say in the middle of the intersection it was smack dab in the middle of the intersection.  I turned around to see if I could get back there before it was rolled over by a car but when I got back there, I realized that if I tried to walk out there I would be killed because it was so centered that at any one time, traffic was driving over that area.  It was rush hour traffic (around 5pm) and there was no break in the traffic.  From the picture you can see it was 6 lanes of traffic or more from any direction.  At this point, all I could see was the case getting rolled over and over by cars going in each direction.  It looked like Mexican jumping bean as trucks and cars of all sizes just rolled over it.  I decided to give up on it since I was in a hurry and because I was convinced that no phone could withstand a 2 to 5 ton rollover once if not more than once.  But I looked up the find iphone app and to my surprise it was still getting a signal.  I called the sheriff to help me hoping that they would arrive soon, but after seeing the sheriff drive by three times, and an hour passing by all I could see was hope flashing by.  The phone was rolled over and bounced from side to side at least 500 times if not more in the hour it took for the sheriff to come.  When they came and picked up the phone, they couldn't believe it that the phone was still working.  I expected the glass to be shattered and the phone severely scratched but when I took it out of the case, the phone was as good as new.  The case looked like it had gone thru a war zone, fully scratched, cracked and broken but the phone was unscathed!!  It was unbelievable.  I've attached photos of the case and the phone after the ordeal.  This case is big and bulky but it did exactly what it was supposed to do and it is worth every penny.  I realize people want skinny and small cases, and this case is big and bulky but I wouldn't use anything but this.  I am heartbroken that Otterbox discontinued this case but maybe they'll reconsider because this case is AMAZING!!  I saw firsthand what it did to protect my investment and it did exactly that.  This is a must buy if you are looking for something to really protect your investment.", "summary": "MILITARY GRADE AND WORTH EVERY PENNY!!

The instructions for the receiver were largely absent, but to the extent you could deduce something from the picture provided, they were wrong. Having never done this before I was not certain how the card should be placed and located. A Google inquiry revealed what in retrospect seemed obvious, that the two contacts on the receiver lined up with contacts above and to the left of the battery inside the S4.  The picture never pointed that out and suggested locating the receiver further down in the phone where it would not make proper contact.\n\nIn any event, once the receiver was properly installed, that part worked fine.  It did fit inside the phone without causing a problem for the back cover.  And if I placed the phone on my wife's charging pad (she has a Nexus 5), the phone charged fine.  So the receiver  clearly worked.  But the phone would not charge when placed on the charging pad in this package. The S4 displays a message when set on a charging pad, alerting you that you that it is now charging wirelessly.  Put the phone on my wife's pad, and it displays that message and then goes back to sleep and charges.  Place the phone on the pad supplied with this item, and it also displays the message--sometimes.  But even when it does, it keeps redisplaying it periodically, as if one were taking it off the pad and putting it back on, repeatedly.  For some reason, then, it apparently keeps losing and regaining wireless contact, never retaining it long enough to establish a charge.  Clearly, defective.\n\nSome others may have received pads that functioned better; this might be a quality control problem and if you're luckier than me, you might get one that works.  It's also possible that some who found theirs did not work never got the receiver properly installed, given the poor directions.  In any event, all I know for sure is the one I got did not work properly, hence the single star.  I am returning it to Amazon, which as usual gave me no hassle in the return.", "summary": "Receiver worked but charging pad did not", "unixReviewTime": 1393545600}

I find I am less likely to push them by accident.\n* BATTERY: It's replaceable so you can have a spare for emergencies or just replace it when the one you have becomes \"not so great\".\n\nWhat I DON'T love:\n* OS: No updates after 6.0 without doing it manually\n* VOLUME BUTTONS (on back): When using it in the holder in my car the buttons are covered in such a way that I can barely reach the volume up and definitely cannot reach the volume down.  However the holder also covers the sides of the phone, so if the volume buttons were in the typical location I would be unable to reach them too.\n* BATTERY LIFE is just \"OK\": If I just use it for voice/text and minimal data (like browsing FB), it will last about one day.  However if I tried to play games on it all evening, as I once did, it would have to be charged several times a day.

Why did it take me SOOOOOOO long to not get one earlier? Where was my head at!!\n\nI was attending a conference in Austin,TX a few weeks ago, I have a HTC EVO and I went through 2 batteries while I was there and still my EVO was burning up the battery. So, before my phone died, I started to research online about a battery  supply solution for my horrible HTC EVO draining device, when I came across the New Trent IMP500. I read the many 5 star reviews on this device and decided I MUST HAVE IT. Let me tell you.....I have now thought to myself how the HECK did I live without it!!!\n\nSince I bought my NewTrent device, my Uncle, my niece, my mom AND and girlfriends daughter all bought the IMP500! I have turned them ALL on to it.\n\nThis NewTrent IMP500 device would definitely get 5 stars! Without a doubt. It is very new age looking, shiny black and blue cover, sturdy, along with a very simple, easily understood and has usable accessories. This is just FUN. It's fun to plug in your phone and then go out to eat and have your phone plug into its own source on the table your eating at.

I have encountered many products that seem to be good but come off easily, are a pain to install, poor fits, and a variety of other issues.\n\nI prepped the screen as instructed and followed the application instructions.  Super easy to follow and the screen went on just as advertised.  So far it does not appear as if it will come off easily (as many other brands I have tried did).  I am interested to see how these screens hold up.  I have installed them on 10 different electronic devices within my home and family.  They will be exposed to occasional use and heavy use.  They do not have a glare and have not given any problems with the touch screen sensitivity.\n\nOverall I am super happy with the product so far.  If they peel off easily or I notice any other issues I will be sure to return and modify the review to reflect these issues.  As it stands right now these are actually much better than I ever expected them to be, especially for the advertised price.  So far I like these just as much, if not more, than the Invisashields I have used religiously in the past.\n\nI am also a huge fan of the lifetime guarantee this company offers.  I will definitely be buying these in the future for my family and friends to use on their electronic devices.\n\nI did receive the first several protectors as part of a review program.

I acquired this charger at a reduced rate for review. I could not be happier. It is very stylish. It is of 4.7 x 2.6 x 0.3 inches. It is almost the same size as my iPhone. I carry it in my front shirt pocket. This is how portable it is.\nFunctionally, it contains 5000mAh of power -- enough to provide two charges to an iPhone 6s or one charge to a Galaxy S7; smart and fastest charge with speed up to 2.1A. I used it to charge my iPhone 6, my wife Samsung, my daughters iPad, and various other devices without any issues.\nThe additional feature that I like is the superior safety of the device. It is considered to be safer than ordinary Li-ion cell, Lithium-ion Polymer cell adds extra protection for you. The cell that the FOXNOV device uses is also adopted by Anker portable chargers.\nIn summary, I highly recommend this charger. I would say it is ideal for a quick charge or emergency. I would only recommend it to be around 10,000mAh instead as this level appears to be the standard these days. It would last longer and would be more appropriate for me who is a business traveler.", "summary": "A nice charger to own", "unixReviewTime": 1470787200}

My husband's case is nice and tight.  This got so annoying after awhile that I took the case off and got a different brand.

Schmidt", "reviewText": "*Disclosure: I was contacted by Yubi Power and given a sample of this product specifically for the purpose of reviewing it.*\n\nTest devices:\nGoogle Nexus 7\nAsus Transformer TF-101\nKindle Fire HD 7\"\nHTC One\nSamsung Galaxy Nexus\nHTC EVO 4G LTE\n\nUp until recently, I'd been using a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Scosche-Dual-USB-Car-Charger/dp/B000RYSU7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Scosche Dual USB Car Charger</a>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Satechi-Soundfly-View/dp/B006GHBVGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Satechi Soundfly View</a>&nbsp;with a splitter for charging up the usual devices I carry about.  This is typically my phone and one or more tablets, though more than once I've had a friend along that was in need. The 500mA output on the Scosche isn't great, not giving much of a charge during my 45min-1.5hr commute, especially if was using one of the devices during the trip.  The Soundfly was a bit better, but still only half what I could get from an AC outlet and charger.  And then comes the Yubi Power unit.  The construction is solid, and it has a red LED ring along the outer edge to let you know that it's connected to power.  The red doesn't go with my blue interior lighting, but oh well.  Overall, it looks good and the low profile keeps it from sticking out like a sore thumb.  On to the testing.\n\nOut of the gate, the Asus Transformer was not impressed with the Yubi.  The Yubi isn't the first of charger my Transformer refuses to play well with, so I wasn't surprised.  Likely this is due to the Yubi being wired up to match Apple's charging method while the Transformer has it's own ideas.  My guess will be that a Samsung Galaxy Tab will having similar issues, as it too is known not to work with Apple's setup. Outside of that device, everything else worked great, both in single an dual charging setups.  I used a 2A wall charger to compare the charge rate on each device, then repeated with the Yubi.  As expected, the difference in rate was nil.  Things got interesting when I started comparing in dual charging mode.  What should happen, according to the secs and details on the Yubi, is that each device should charge at half the rate of a single device (2A/2 devices = 1A per device, or, 10W/2 devices = 5W per device).  What I found however is that in all dual charging scenarios, the devices charged at the same rate as when they were charged by themselves.  To verify that they would charge slower if not given 2A, I tested each with a 1A charger and the Scosche adapater.  Sure enough, there was a significantly lower rate of charge.  So, what does this mean?  The biggest thing is that the Yubi I got was able to charge two devices, at the same time, and at the same rate as if they were plugged into a wall charger.  That's huge for me.  I don't know if I got an extra special unit from Yubi, or if this is the norm, but it was sealed in retail packaging, and I'm quite happy with my new adapter.", "summary": "Dual goodness", "unixReviewTime": 1369612800}

I have seen my share of phone cases, and there are some that I love but they are higher priced. What I am trying to do is keep in mind the price of this iPhone 6S Tempered Glass Screen Protector, TeckNet Premium Tempered Glass Screen Protector For Apple iPhone 6S and iPhone 6 with 9H Hardness and 96% Transparency\n in terms of the quality/value compared with the pricepoint. At this pricepoint, this is an awesome deal. I got another one for my iPhone, and this one for the anti-apple person in my house. I love when products have nice packages. To me, this means that the manufacturer or seller is proud of their product. I usually get my screen protectors from the mall, where they charge anywhere from 15-60 bucks depending on if it is made of plastic, glass, or that crazy bull-proof and drop-a-hammer-on-my-phone-proof stuff. I usually settle for the 15 or 20 buck ones, and I have realized that it's so expensive just because they charge for \"labor\" AKA 10 minutes of putting a screen protector on my phone and squeezing the air bubbles out with a library card. I decided to try it on my own. I don't have the patience for it so I had my girlfriend do it for me. It was easy enough to install and great that it came with all the tools-of-the-trade. It's a lot thicker than the typical plastic screen protectors, making feel like it's more protected. If you have the patience to install this by yourself to save a few bucks, then this is the screen protector for you. It is easy enough to apply yourself, seeing as each step and sticker is labeled for you. It comes with all the tools of the trade.\n\nPackinging=A+\nEase of installation=A+\nCoverage=A+\nPrice=A+\nDoes it protect my screen?=A+\n\nI really have zero complaints for this pack! It feels durable, was easy to install, and fits perfectly. What more could you ask for?\n\nI received this product at a promotional price for my honest review.", "summary": "Nice thick screen protector for a lower price than the mall!", "unixReviewTime": 1453161600}

Ive tried out a cable one before that was magnetic like this, but this simple adapter is so much better of an idea in my opinion, because all I have to do is keep the magnetic tip plugged into my iPhone at all times and I can simply throw the little adapter piece in my pocket so that I can always use it no matter where I go, no matter whos Lightning cable I borrow if Im visiting somewhere, and I don't have to worry about lugging around a special cable to use, I can just use any cable I want.\n\nThe idea of having it magnetic has two awesome benefits as far as I see it; the most obvious one is that touted by the Magsafe cable Apple uses on its Macbooks, that if you ever trip over the wire if safely breaks away without pulling your device down with it and crashing into the floor (and this adapter works exactly as youd expect in that regard). But also the other added benefit is that if you keep the tip always installed in your iPhone like I mentioned I do, then all you ever have to do to plug it in is hold the cable with the adapter nearby to your phone and it will quickly just plug itself in with a satisfying snap using the magnetism. And by the way, I also love keeping the tip installed because I always have my iPhone in my pocket, and the charging port collects way more lint than you think (seriously, next time you have a pin or toothpick swipe around in there, youll pull out a TON of dust), and so keeping the tip installed means I never get any dust, lint, or dirt if I drop it falling into the port (now if only they made something like this for the headphone jack).\n\nI did receive this product at a discounted cost in exchange for an honest review, but I was not compensated or instructed to leave a positive review; the opinion stated is that of my own. I hope my details provided illustrate that I honestly enjoy this product and take pride in helping with an accurate, unbiased review.", "summary": "Neat Little Adapter; It Was Exactly What I Hoped!", "unixReviewTime": 1458604800}

The Case comes in 4 different colors, I chose the Army green because it fits me better. You can also get the case in black, tan, and the older BDU camo pattern.\n\nThe build Quality of the pouch is very nice, all the stitching is tight and straight. There are quite a lot of thread ends that could have been cut off, or burned down, but those are easy to take care of. The outside of the pouch seems to be made out of the same materials as the old Military Molle gear, but can still be used with current Army OD green gear, and it would look just like a piece of issued gear.  All of the Fasteners seem to be very well attached to the Case. The inside of the Case is made of a softer Nylon material so that it should not scratch your phone. The pouch comes with a Aluminium locking Carabiner that can be attached to the D-ring on the top of the pouch if you want it to hang from your bag, or attach it to the strap of a messenger bag. The Clasp on the front that keeps the top flap secured sees to be made of a good Hard plastic and has a nice design that makes it easy to open and close\n\nThe pocket area of the pouch is a good size, My note 5 with a Slim case will fit in the pocket with a little extra wiggle room, but this in no way would allow the phone to come out of the pouch, a friend of mine has a note 5 in a life proof type case and his phone fit in the pocket very snuggley.\n\nThe straps on the back of the pouch can be set up in a few different configurations, so that it can be attached to a variety of belts,  bags, and other gear. All you have to do is use the slots on the back of the pouch slip the straps through the slots and it changes the length of the belt loop to stay secured to your side.\n\nCouple problems arise with this pouch, first if you are looking for a pouch that is waterproof this would not be for you, as the pouch is open on both sides at the top and bottom, so it will not keep your phone from getting wet, so if you're like me and only have a slim case on your phone it will not stop the rain. Second problem would be if you use wired headphones for hands free calling or to listen to music, This case would not work for you, as there is no way to have wired headphones plugged into any phone that has the headphone jack on either the top or bottom of the phone (which is wear most headphone jacks are located). So for purposes of hands free operation without a  Bluetooth device would be difficult. I personally use a combination of Bluetooth and wired listening options as I cant always have one or the other all the time. So for me at work I would not be able to carry my phone on my belt with this Pouch as I would not be able to use my wired earphones.\n\nOverall this pouch has a very durable and rugged design and works great for my phone, for a tactical phone pouch it will work great as it will be attached to the strap of my backpack so that I can have my phone near enough that I will hear it when it goes off.  I would recommend this Pouch to anyone that spends a lot of time doing outdoor activities like Hiking or Camping as it is a great way to carry your phone without having it in your pocket or in a clip on belt case that has a chance of coming unclipped and possible damaging the phone.\n\nI received this product for free or at a discounted price.", "summary": "Great Tactical Pouch for larger Phones", "unixReviewTime": 1461715200}

I've had the opportunity to review MANY many many many of these types of tempered screen protectors now. I'm generally in love with them, but when it comes down to these reviews I'm splitting hairs a bit. Many of my reviews will sound similar, but note that I'm basically using a rubric to rate these.\n\nSo this item from TECKNET is very very nice. I'm digging the 2.5D aspect of many of these (compared to the eBay ones). These are tapered a bit at the edges such that, hopefully, if you hit it wrong on the edge it is much less likely to break. That said, hitting glass, of any sort, on the edge is going to be the easiest way to break it. The protector has a few other things going for it... for one, 3 for 6 bucks is unheard of cheap... very nice to have.  It also has a cutout for the front camera... which is actually hard to find in these things.\n\nNow, I won't know for a while whether or not this particular protector holds up better or worse than others... and frankly I'm not expecting it to last forever...\n\nTo be perfectly honest... I do have a hard time telling most of these apart. Thickness and the beveled edges tend to be the defining factors. If it works, it'll work, and if you hit it, it'll probably break at some point... for most of them that is.\n\nThis all being said, tempered glass is absolutely the way to go. If you haven't tried them, these basically look like the screen of your phone, basically respond the same, and will take the bulk of the damage if you hit it wrong etc., and crack before your screen does. I've used these for the last few years and generally, up until recently, grabbed cheap ones from eBay. Also, tempered in general tends to go on bubble free! total bonus!\n\nI received this item at a discounted price for a fair and unbiased review. I was not otherwise compensated. Additionally, I do take these reviews seriously. I do take into consideration price at the time of the review and if I think something is overpriced I do dock them for that, or note it where necessary. If a product is BAD, I do not hesitate to give it 1 star.", "summary": "Very very good for the price.", "unixReviewTime": 1457913600}

I have always felt that when I have a tempered glass protector, it feels that my phone is more protected because the actual protector is much thicker. The phone also has another degree of protection because of the tempered glass.\nThe box comes the with same things that other protectors usually come with. The protector and a microfiber clothe that will help clean the screen and the protector in the future. Also, there is a high quality squeegee that comes in the package to help with the installation. The installation was pretty easy for this. I actually messed up the first time so I picked it up and stuck it back without any bubbles! This is a great product because you get a whole kit from a reputable company including lifetime warranty, which most third party screen do not come with. I would highly recommend this protector to anyone because for a low price, not only do you get a screen protector, but an installation kit and a lifetime guarantee/warranty.\nOverall, this is a nice kit and their is no downfall for this.\n\n** Note: I was provided this product for free or at a discounted price in exchange for a completely honest and unbiased review.

Because it allows slightly misaligned screen protector. Not this one, you have to be perfectly align other wise it will not fit. This can be a good thing if you have superb installation skills. So most people will just have to realign over and over again and introduce dusts along the way and you will have to remove partially and realign again and more dusts. So you see where this is going now.\n\nBut the good part of this CitiGeeks screen protectors are they include dust removal sticker and touch up tape which is a great addition. Normally I would just use a scotch tape, but for some reason, the screen protector on the lower part of the screen is almost impossible to remove once it's installed if you see any dusts. So their touch up tape are better than scotch tape, as they are more sticky but I still need to let it sit on the screen for a few minutes to get the adhesive to bond with the screen protector other wise the touch up tape will not left the screen protector either.\n\nMy recommendation to CitiGeeks is cut the screen protector slightly smaller and this will be a 5 Star product.", "summary": "The Screen Protector is Exact Match of The Screen - Bad Thing!!", "unixReviewTime": 1401753600}

The extra people might be in the vehicle (which would be a little weird, as the microphone would typically be on the driver's sun visor).  But, in a multi-driver household, any driver would have hands-free operation.\n\nWhat's not to like?  Well, all of the features of the T325 that this speakerphone does not have which make the T325 more \"hands-free\" than the T225.\n\nThis is a very basic, 'dumb' unit.  When a phone rings, it announces that the call is for Phone 1, Phone 2, etc.  If two paired phones are in the car, you have to have some idea which phone is 1 or 2 (etc) to know if it is your phone that is ringing or someone else's.  Doesn't sound like a huge deal, but...\n\nWhat about when only one of multiple paired phones is in the car?  This phone simply rings and says that there is an incoming call.  You have no idea who it is from.  The T325 announces the caller by name.  If you don't want to answer the call on this T225, you have to somehow press both the volume UP and DOWN buttons at the same time.  With the T325, you just press a single button.\n\nHow about dialing?  Both support voice dialing using your phones own voice-dialing feature.  So, the intelligence depends on your phone itself.  But, what about calling your 'favorites' or frequently called numbers?  The T225 offers nothing.  The T325 memorizes a list of favorite contacts and easily lets you scroll through the list with one button, listening to the name being announced and then pressing the dial button when the name comes up.\n\nEntering the car, the T325 announces \"Connected to John Smith's iPhone. Battery level is high\" (e.g.) - while the T225 announces \"Connected to Phone 1.  Battery level is high.\"  Receiving a call, the T325 announces \"Call from David Jackson\".  The T225 announces \"Call for Phone 1\".\n\nThe T225 is so limited - its only real feature is the ability to pair with multiple phones - that I just cannot recommend it, when I consider how powerful and useful the T325 is.\n\nI've posted a photo showing both the T225 and T325 clipped to the sun visor to compare their sizes/shapes.", "summary": "Could have been great, but limited feature set", "unixReviewTime": 1320710400}

The description said it would work for a Galaxy NOTE 5 smartphone even with a thin case.  I have a clear, thin case on my [very expensive] phone in order to protect it.  The case is just thick enough to protect the camera from touching the floor / ground, and so too the screen.

My NOTE II slid easily into and out of that holster, with the magnetic closure providing the protection it was designed for - even when I went jogging.  In addition, the clasp provided a small amount of flexion, enough to make it relatively easy to slide the holster onto my belt.

I picked this case because I had also bought the Samsung GS3 Multimedia dock and I wanted a case that would enable me to fit the phone into the dock without removing it.  A YouTube video I watched verified that this case would be perfect with the dock.  When I received the case I was delighted to see the fit was perfect.\n\nThe case comes in two halves, a top and bottom piece that slide into the appropriate ends of the phone rear.  Once the two halves are locked, you can be assured they are secured.  In fact, it's quite difficult to remove the casing (though not impossible) once locked.\n\nThe case provides a nice lip around the front of the phone that should help protect the screen if it falls straight down.  The back of the phone is entirely protected, and it has a nice slightly \"rubbery\" feel that gives the hand a better grip on the phone.  I like the way the phone easily slips in and out of the pocket.\n\nThis is a quality case, and as I noted in my review title, the one that you will most want to consider for your Galaxy 3.  When I move up to the Note 2 in November, I am hoping surface cases will be made available for that phone.\n\nGood luck in your hunt for the perfect case.

Hurricane Sandy rolled through this week, and we had our first real test of the lanterns when the power went out (and stayed out).  The Eddie Bauer lantern was not as bright and lasted only about an hour before going dim.  The no-brand lantern lasted a bit longer but was very difficult to use -- it wasn't configured to put the light where needed.  Our d.lights, on the other hand, performed flawlessly.  We used both the area lantern (the d.light S10) and also this task light (d.light S1).  The area lantern (the S10) kept large (15x30 foot) living spaces lit well enough to work (preparing dinner, etc.).  And the task light (S1) was fantastic for reading, doing paperwork, etc.  All of the d.light lanterns lasted from sundown to bed time at full brightness -- the S10 lanterns were on the whole time (about 6 hours), while the S1 task lights were used intermittently (probably 3-4 hours).  Both the S10 and the S1 are designed for functionality -- the area lantern is very easy to hang, and the S1 task light puts light right where you need it.  Last but not least, they recharged the next day with only partial sunlight and were ready to go for a second night.\n\nLong and the short of it:  D.light lanterns are awesome!  Hands down, these are the best power outage lanterns available, and at a great price.  I just placed an order for a few more.  These are far more valuable than battery-eating flashlights when facing a sustained power outage.\n\n05-Nov-2012:  Important Note.  If you're looking for a whole-room lantern, as opposed to a task, light, you'll probably want to get the d.light S10.  The S1 (this product) is a task light, for reading, etc.  Both are great products -- just designed for slightly different uses.", "summary": "The light that beat Hurricane Sandy", "unixReviewTime": 1351555200}

It really fits the the phone like a glove. I prefer hard cases to malleable ones and although this is some sort of multilayer clear plastic, it is pretty much a hard shell case. It is difficult to get the phone out, and although it did it a couple times I'm afraid to break the buttons if i do it often, so I will just leave it.\n\nThe front of the case sits higher than the screen, even with a tempered glass scren protector on it, so the case will hit instead of the screen if it is dropped on a flat surface.  The corners have some kind of different cushion to them to help protect those as well.  I tend to drop my phone regularly, although I haven't so much since I upgraded a year ago to the 6s Plus from a 5s (the 5s had a death wish, but it never succeeded despite regular attempts.). I only ever had a thin plastic case with a tempered screen on the 5s. Although the 6s Plus is a larger heavier phone I'm figuring a similar setup should work, which it has on the two occasions I dropped it (different case from this one).  My one concern with this case is that it is very smooth and pretty slick. I still haven't dropped the phone with this case on it, but the grip is not as good as with a more textured case. It is too pretty not to use and I trust it to protect the phone.\n\nAs for aesthetics, this case is much prettier (and I do mean prettier, it has a very femine look) in person than on my computer screen.  I have a rose gold iPhone and debated between the clear with gold glitter and the pink/purple with glitter. The orchid one accents the phone beautifully, and looks fabulous.

I feel bad about writing such a bad review but I'm really trying to make sure nobody gets stuck with this lemon of a phone and here is why.  1) Camera: this is the absolute worse camera on any phone, is has NO auto focus so if you want to take a pic of something small or with letters, forget it,very blurry as there is NO auto focus; 2) Storage: No matter how much you transfer things to your SD card and yes I have plenty of room, the apps for some reason get transferred back to the phone then it says \"no storage available\" and when you look at the storage remaining which is plenty, it still won't let you update apps or load any more; 3) Lollipop:  this OS is really slow and I can't confirm if it's because of the phone or just he OS system but when you finish with any app and go back to your home screen it is really slow and it takes a few seconds before you can see the apps on your home screen so you really can't just hop from one app to another, you have to wait a few seconds, which doesn't sound like much but it does get annoying.  Like I said, I can't get rid of this phone fast enough and hope this helps anyone who is attempting to buy one, at leas the one from MetroPCS is this bad.

The case feels very nice in your hand- it has a suede like finish that is smooth and soft but not slippery. It adds minimal bulk but still offers good protection of the corners and even the front screen. The camera lens is protected as well. The power and volume buttons work well and the vibrate switch is more easily accessible than most other cases I have tried. The access to the charging port is fantastic- I have multiple after market cables- and every single one works without removing the case. I am also able to plug into my docking station without removing any part of the case (this is a rare find!). If you do have a docking station that is not compatible- the gold section slips off easily for full access. It is certainly one of the easiest cases to put on and remove. I was concerned that this would get \"caught\" in my pocket and leave my phone at risk, but it seems to be quite secure and I have had no issues with unintentional slippage. The price point is great and I will likely buy another in a different color to have some variety.

It does everything and more.. Some of the issues others are having, I never noticed during my 2 months of owning it. The only reason mine lasted 2 months is because of damage caused at my own fault. However, I just ordered another from the same seller, and am waiting on my new one. Right now I am using the LG Tribute 5 as a temp replacement. In my opinion, There is nothing to really argue.. The LG G Stylo is way better. In my opinion it is the best prepaid android phone on the market. I have yet to see another android that beats this one. Even with the newer LG G Stylo 2, There is not much difference. I did not figure it to be worth the extra. I only paid about $50 the first time I bought it, and about $50 this time too. To me its worth the full hundred. I have dropped this phone so many times without leaving a mark on the screen what so ever without a case. The back takes damage easy tho.. I recommend getting a case when you buy this phone. The screen only broke because it took a large amount of pressure when it fell without a case. So this time I bought the case first. ;) hahahaha  (Also note: It says in the listing 13MP camera. However, the Virgin Mobile  one is only 8MP). But it does update to Android 6.0  Also a tip: If it starts to freeze or glitch, Simply restart your phone and give it about 5 minutes to boot. After that, it will work without issues. I only had to power it off once for that reason and it never happened again. My next review will be after 6 moths of ownership from my new replacement so I can keep everyone up to date on the specs. But so far as of October of 2016, It is still very up to date.", "summary": "The best out of many phones I owned.", "unixReviewTime": 1464912000}

(The pentalobe screwdriver is perfect for making those tiny holes).

Surely a mixture doomed to some sort of disaster.  But its working okay for me.  Someone in the 'refurbishing' process crossed out the VM logo with a sharpie.  You can still see it though.\n\nFirst off, this has gotten a LOT of firmware updates in the last year, so many problems you see from 2014 to early 2015 may have been fixed by those.  Second, this is a lot to set up for someone not familiar with doing manual setup on a router.\n\nOnce you have it set up and on, you can connect to it like any other wireless router from your phone or tablet and go to 192.168.1.1 and then log in with the default password (seems to be either 'admin' or 'password' or blank, depending on the device.  Once in, you can change all of the wireless settings like SSID, password, other wifi configuration, to lock it to use LTE only, etc.  Its got about a dozen pages of configuration stuff to tinker with.  I set mine up to use a hidden SSID so nobody can even see it unless they know the name and password, to show the SSID and password on the main screen, and to show how much data I've used.  You can reset the data manually from these setup screens.\n\nFirst thing your device will want to do is gobble up about 140-150MB of firmware updates and I don't see any way to do that over another connection, but its possible.  Update your profile and PRL databases while you're in the menu, this will give you the latest information about Sprint's network, such as it is.\n\nHere's the good.  This is a \"Sprint Spark\" device, in fact it was one of the first if not THE first.  Spark is Sprints latest triple band network enhancement, which is being rolled out but is still in limited availability.  One of the bands is particularly good at penetrating into buildings, so that Sprint \"lost inside\" effect is minimized if you're in one of the areas they've implemented the new network bands.  Its their intention to build out the Spark capability in the future, so the good news is LTE connectivity with this device should continuously improve, especially in urban areas and near major highways.  If I recall right, Spark is capable of realistic speeds in the 50-60Mb/s range.\n\nThe device has a good wifi capability, although my devices only connected with it at 65Mb/s which is okay because in a best case scenario I'm not going to get close to that in real world LTE throughput.\n\nIt has two external connectors for small to enormous antennas but be advised that while an antenna improves your chance of reception (download), it doesn't do a lot for transmission (upload).  If you look for 'netgear mingle external antenna' you'll see that there are models from $10-100 and up.  I don't think I'd spend a lot of money for a giant antenna, but a pair of smaller cheaper ones would probably improve fringe connections.  Two of the three Spark bands (and they may be all you get) don't do well with penetrating walls, so putting this in a window might help, especially if you can put it in a second or third story window facing the nearest tower.\n\nIt has a replaceable battery, so you can get a second or third one.  Nice feature.  The case itself is flimsy.  It has a ridge all around that enables you to pop it open very easily although so far it hasn't happened to me by accident.\n\nThe device also appears to have a GPS inside, giving you basic latitude and longitude and has a button to start and stop tracking.  There doesn't seem to be much about what this does or how to use it.  Perhaps when the device is tethered to a PC with a usb connection and in conjunction with a mapping app that supports external GPS devices it can act as a standalone GPS.  It might be my imagination, but the device seems to acquire an LTE signal better when GPS feature is turned on.  I'd bet that depletes the battery fast.\n\nI've used this for a few hours here and there and it gave me decent email/web browsing even at one LTE bar.  I haven't seen it give me more than 1 bar, but I'm in a suburb and not a Spark area.  Freedompoop gives me .5GB of data a month for free.  My plan is to have my elementary age son keep this in a hidden pocket of his backpack so he can download a few books a week to his e-reader in class, since the school won't allow use of their wifi and his e-reader doesn't have a way of doing anything other than wifi.\n\nWhat I wouldn't do is buy this as a tether for a general purpose computer like a Windows/Mac machine.  While a phone/tablet/chromebook sips data, a full feature operating system can gluck down a GB or two in short order, doing updates and all sorts of background stuff.  I've seen some people have Windows 10 background update over their hotspot/LTE device and run their bill up into triple figures, or lock them out if they hit a monthly cap.", "summary": "Capable hotspot I got very cheaply, may be better now with updates to firmware and Sprint Spark network than early reviews show", "unixReviewTime": 1448841600}

But that is it. The opening is not tall enough to fit any other cord. The OEM cable is incredibly thin, and I can't find any that thin.\n\nTwo huge problems. The charging port opening is not big enough for any of the chargers in my house. It should at the very least work with the one that comes with the phone! I also have a very slim one from Monoprice and it doesn't work either. They all are too tall, too low, or too wide. Such a bummer because I really liked this case until I needed to charge it. See picture.\n\nIt does work with wireless charging. So that's definitely an option. So I gave it 2 stars, instead of one.\n\nSecond issue. The screen protector has the infamous \"halo effect.\" Essentially, the screen protector is not made to fit the screen correctly. Therefore, the screen protector doesn't stick to any of the edges all the way around. It's probably about a 1/4 of an inch all the way around. Not only does it look bad, but I'm sure it will be a dirt magnet. See picture.\n\nA side note. I wish they would have stated how much lip they give the front of the phone. It's barely enough with the screen protector. I'm just curious to know how much it is to compare it to other cases. It does help with thinness, and so I might find i like the size. I just wish I'd know the exact amount, because lots of other cases say the exact height so you can compare.\n\nI will contact Ghostek to see if they are planning to fix these two problems and offer replacements (Sometime in the future). Who knows, maybe they will contact all of their customers once they realize their mistake.\n\nBTW: I got mine on ebay for cheaper.\n\nPRO's: Real metal. I was worried it was plastic coated in something that 'contained' aluminum. But upon tapping it on metal, it gave a nice long \"ring\" and not the plastic short \"ding.\" The metal seems to be very rigid. I don't expect it to bend. My guess it that they leaned towards high Yield strength, so it is more likely to crack then bend. This is actually a good thing, I hope they did. It means it less likely to get scratched.  It also means that if you were to sit on it, it will try to 'hold up' and try to protect your phone, instead of just bending, and putting all the stress on your phone. Also, it fits really snug, and for that reason I don't think it will ever snap under normal drops.\n I was worried about the real metal hurting the signals. But it doesn't hurt the wifi signal (I have a wifi network my note5 can get, but it's about 500 feet away, it gets it with zero bars, so I use this to test between phones and cases- if it can pick up the signal, then it's uninhibited).", "summary": "Real customer who bought this for the note5", "unixReviewTime": 1440633600}

All of these qualities and staying flexible too, now that is something to be proud of.\n\nWhile I have all the watch tools that I need so I can change any band on any watch this comes with a little band changing set that I used so I could tell you how well it worked. While not the easiest to use it was still pretty simple.  The tool that comes with the band will get the job done, so no worries.  Most of the time when something comes with a tool like this, it is not made to be kept after the initial change but this tool can be kept in a drawer or added to your tool collection for future band changes.\n\nIf you are in need of a new band for your Samsung Gear S2 Classic Smart Watch I would recommend purchasing this Henoda Royal Blue 20mm Replacement Rubber Band.", "summary": "Great Quality Watch Band!!", "unixReviewTime": 1453420800}

I've owned a couple and I know they vary from manufacturer to manufacturer on how they are made. That may be obvious but portable solar panels are somewhat of a new trend. Because of this, they can be wildly different in the way they achieve their results.\n\nIf you are one of those people who like unboxing videos, including myself, give my video a try. I don't really get into any details, though. I'll cover that in my review below.\n\nSo let's talk about the performance. I could whip out my multimeter and measure the actual performance of the solar panel but that's kind of pointless. The reason is that we are using it to power and charge USB devices. That's pretty much a constant voltage and amperage needed for that.\n\nSo that means I'm looking for a couple of things. First is, does it work? I should be able to hook up my USB device and be able to charge it in a decent time. Second, how big is the actual solar panel? I want maximum coverage so that if the sun is not that bright, there are more panels to pick up the slack. Again, I'm not looking for overall wattage, just the more cells the less amount of light has to be present.\n\nImagine it like a camera for those who are familiar with one. It's not necessarily about the Megapixels. The sensor size plays a much bigger role in capturing light than just straight up MP.\n\nI'll tell you right now. This solar panel fits both of those requirements for me! It was sunny outside with a quite a bit of cloud coverage and I was able to charge my battery pack in a matter of hours. Had it been one of those battery packs with the built-in solar panel, it would have taken twice as long. Again, more cells mean better low light performance.\n\nSo if you are in the market for a compact solar panel to charge your USB devices, look no further. This thing works awesome! To maximize your results, get a high capacity battery pack on top of this. At least 10,000 milliampere hours should do!\n\nThis solar panel was given to me at a discount for my fair and unbiased review. This in no way shape or form affected my review.", "summary": "Recommended!", "unixReviewTime": 1466121600}

I had to try out a few different positions before settling on the center passenger side vent because the center one on the drivers side blocked the clock in my car.\n\nMy phone is held very securely when in the mount.

She went with the Samsung Galaxy S3. I was very satisfied with how the skinomi protected her Droid X and I would have purchased one for my Droid X as well, if I didn't already have mine in an Otterbox defender.\n\nI put her X on Ebay and posted some pictures showing just how immaculate the phone was - the screen obviously in a large part due to the skinomi skin. I included a couple extras and ended up getting over $100 for the phone, so the investment definitely paid for itself several times over.\n\nAlright...on to my review of the Galaxy S3 skinomi skin review.\n\nAt this point I was familiar with Skinomi's packaging and their application instructions. Anyone that's ever applied one of these things on a phone knows that the first thing you have to do is create a completely clean and dust-free environment. The way I do this is to construct a room encased with plastic sheeting with a fan pulling air out, and one pulling air in through a filter. If you've ever seen the showtime hit Dexter then it's basically like his kill rooms with fans added to it. This is basically the only way you can put one of these damn things one without ending up with those little bubbles with microscopic specs of dust when you're done.\n\nAnyway...the spray they send with it - spray your fingers with it. Spray the face of your phone with it (not too much, or it'll be too slippery slidery!) and spray the back of the skinomi with it. I've become pretty good at this with experience.\n\nHOWEVER - even when I had the skinomi position perfectly I would allow it to dry (I just put it in front of a fan for a bit until that hazy look behind the screen goes away, indicating that it has dried - the left side of the skin started to \"lift\" away. Thinking that this was because I didn't have it properly positioned I tried again, and again. To no avail...each time it ended the same.\n\nThis was just a slight annoyance, and it's something that the wife's newly purchased case would cover up....so I just let it be.\n\nBUT THEN!! Some time later (on a camping trip in Acadia, actually!) my phone rang. It was an unknown caller - not a call I typically answer. The individual on the other end of the line identified herself as a Skinomi representative. Oh great. Now these people are harassing me with phone calls!? Ugh! .....only....not. She was just calling to follow up with my recent purchase to see how things went. I explained the issues I had with the application and she indicated that this shouldn't happen, and offered to send me out a replacement skin.\n\nI received the replacement and gave it another shot and this time it was flawless.\n\nI had experience Skinomi's awesome products, but until now I hadn't experienced their amazing customer service. Perhaps I should knock off a star for the hassle, but it wasn't a big deal and I wasn't even going to worry about it. But because they went the extra mile to touch base and then send a replacement? 5 stars all day.

Anti glare-Haven't checked this out yet.\n\n4. Anti fingerprint-Not as advertised. I have seen just as many fingerprints on the screen as when there was no screen protector.\n\n5. Privacy protection-Not as advertised. My son actually noticed this before I did. I turned my phone in several angles to see if he could read it and he read it easily every time.\n\nI'm giving 3 stars and I'm giving realook the benefit of the doubt by taking for granted that the anti-glare feature will work tomorrow when I get in the sun and we have tons of sun here in socal.\n\nI got a comment from Crystal Clear which stated:\n\n\"JayFdz says:\n\nI'm sorry to tell you but judging by the picture provided here alone I can tell you're a bit confused. All of those are listed because all of those are the one's available but the highlighted one is Crystal Clear, which is what you paid for. As far as I know there is yet to be a screen protector with all those qualities given, the hardest to do would be combining Crystal Clear with Anti-Glare since Anti-Glare usually deals with a matte finish screen which dims the screen a bit, hence, it's not Crystal Clear. (Privacy Protection also falling into the same reasons). So really, what's advertised is what's available, what's shown and what you received is the one you paid for, Crystal Clear.\"\n\nSo, I stand corrected.  I am revising my review to only rate this item on the \"Crystal Clear\" aspects, but I will state that the packaging is confusing.  Since \"Crystal Clear\" is highlighted, it could be confused as the best of all the features. I should have read everything a little better before purchasing. So I give 4 stars for being crystal clear and will definately be reading labeling and advertising a little better in the future. Sorry if I misled anyone reading my review.", "summary": "Nice, but not as advertised.", "unixReviewTime": 1349913600}

You get a decent-sized screen (5 inches), a dual core 1.3ghz processor, and front (VGA/640x480) and rear (5 Megapixel) cameras. Both work decent enough, just don't expect to get fantastic low-light photos. The screen looks great and is bright enough to easily see it while outside in direct sunlight. It isn't full HD resolution (QHD), but it's enough to easily make out text and graphics and just about any app.\n\nI was able to download and run most every app I typically use on my S5. It is a little bit more sluggish on 3D graphics-intensive apps, but runs all the basic ones flawlessly. There is a little bit of noticeable lag sometimes when dragging through large menus or the \"all apps\" drawer, but nothing terrible.\n\nThe sound and audio out work great for all music apps I tested, and the Bluetooth connected to several devices I tried without issue. GPS also worked well when testing a basic Google Maps navigation.\n\nThe dual SIM support is an awesome feature so you should be covered under most any GSM band and don't have to switch SIM cards around if you travel often or use more than one for whatever reason.\n\nMy favorite thing while first setting this phone up is how it came with a screen protector pre-applied. Why don't the big name phones do this? Brilliant. It's perfectly applied with no bubbles, perfectly straight and in flawless condition. So I don't have to worry much about minor scratches since I can always just swap out the screen protector.\n\nBattery life has been good so far. I would still plan on needing to recharge it each night, but with minimal use, I could get through a day with more than half its life left. With heavy use, it will be dead by night time as is common with most gadgets.\n\nFortunately, this features a removable battery and micro SD card support, which makes swapping for a full battery very nice, and allows you to expand the storage greatly by adding in an SD card. The SD support also makes data transfer much easier, so this is a huge plus for me.\n\nThe only major negative I have after using this phone for a long time is sometimes the dragging action doesn't work right when scrolling through menus. Instead of gripping your finger to drag, it will think you meant to just tap. So it will select a menu option instead of drag/scroll through the menu.\n\nMy general conclusion on this phone is it's about as good as you can get for the price range. If you are used to using a high-end phone, you will quickly notice its shortcomings, but as a backup, secondary, travel, budget, or kid's phone, this is a fantastic buy. Review sample provided by manufacturer.\n\n*Summary*\n\nPros:\n[+] GREAT price, you definitely get a good bang for your buck here\n[+] Includes most core smartphone features you have grown to expect (GPS, Bluetooth, front & rear cameras, wi-fi, ambient light sensor, etc)\n[+] Screen is bright and vibrant, though not full HD\n[+] Sound and audio out works well and provides sufficient volume for most tasks\n[+] Includes perfectly-preapplied screen protector out of the box\n[+] Features removable battery for fast switching for a full (separately purchased) battery\n[+] Features expandable storage through micro SD card support\n[+] Provides me a strong wifi signal and wireless (GSM) signal, though your mileage may vary\n[+] Dual SIM card support, which is something you can't get in mainstream phones\n[+] Doesn't include a ridiculous amount of bloatware like most flagship phones\n[+] Fantastic as a budget travel phone when paired with a prepaid SIM so you don't have to worry as much about your phone being lost/stolen/damaged\n[+] Includes USB cable, AC adapter, 3.5mm earphones, and micro SIM card adapters\n\nCons:\n[-] OS is not latest version and sometimes gets a big sluggish under moderate to high CPU usage\n[-] Scrolling/dragging actions can be kind of finicky, leading to frustrating accidental taps", "summary": "Fantastic budget phone with plenty of features", "unixReviewTime": 1426032000}

The sound is a bit warmer with the new ear tips.  Loving the headphones even more! Let one of my friends who has a pair of beats headphones and he was a lite jealous with the quality/cost and general value of my headphones.\n\n****\n\nSo I definitely love these headphones. I was pleasantly surprised by both the battery life and the audio quality. My main headphones are a wired pair of Shure e315s and interestingly enough I am not at all disappointed by the sound quality. I saw a few other reviews saying that they experienced limited bluetooth range, but I'm not experiencing that with these at all. I am in a hotel with a lot of metal and solid doors, so much so that my cell phone signal isn't that great when I move too far from the window, but even while moving through different areas of the suite they hold a steady connection to my source. Granted, sometimes that depends on the phone you're using as the source tends to change bluetooth strength. The only thing I'm slightly weary about is the fit of the ear tips. I switched to the smallest and they became much more comfortable. I did though buy a pair of memory foam tips from comply to make my listening experience much more enjoyable. I didn't take a star away from the headphones as I don't expect a pair of headphones that I purchased for 24.99 to include 25-30 dollar ear tips.

Today I am reviewing BlackSquid's \"USB Type C Cable (3.3ft/1m) - Type C to Type C Reversible - USB 3.1 Super Speed - Fast Data Sync & Charging Cord\"\n\nToday I am starting something new. This cable is not a legacy USB cable like the majority of my previously reviewed products. Instead, this is a pure C-to-C cable meant to be used with newer accessories such as Type-C chargers, Type-C hard drive enclosures, or Type-C docking stations.\n\nThis cable from Black Squid is a Full-Featured Type-C cable, meaning that it not only supports charging capabilities and basic USB 2.0 data, it also supports USB 3.1 SuperSpeed for much faster data transfer with supported devices (5gbps), and also allows for the extra wires to be repurposed for Alternate Modes such as VESA DisplayPort. All told, this cable should have 10 more wires than a standard USB 2.0 Type-C to Type-C cable to support the extra functionality.\n\nMy test setup today include my trusty Chromebook Pixel 2015, and a Chromium OS USB-PD Sniffer (codename Twinkie).

The Black Squid cable is allowing the SONEic Type-C charger to advertise 3A capable (indicated by the 1691 mV reading on CC2), and Pixel is drawing 3A at 4.6V.\n\nThe next charger, the MacBook 29W charger, will show a different result because it is a USB PD capable charger, and Pixel will attempt to negotiate over PD to a higher voltage.\n\nPixel's ectool output :\nlocalhost ~ # ectool --dev 1 usbpdpower\nPort 0: SNK Charger PD 14403mV / 2000mA, max 14800mV / 2000mA / 29600mW\nPort 1: SRC\n\nAs you can see, Pixel has negotiated 14.4V at 2A over the BlackSquid cable to the MacBook charger.\n\nLet's take an even more detailed look at the negotiation process. Using Twinkie's tracing function (tw trace 1), I can decode the CC communication on the fly to the serial console :\n965415.351337 SRC/0 [2161]SRCCAP 5000mV/2400mA 14800mV/2000mA\n965415.352976 SNK/0 [0041]GOODCRC\n965415.354247 SRC/0 [0161]GOODCRC\n965415.355646 SNK/1 [0241]GOODCRC\n965415.357082 SRC/2 [0566]PSRDY\n965415.358336 SNK/2 [0441]GOODCRC\n965415.359645 SNK/3 [0641]GOODCRC\n965415.360980 SRC/1 [0361]GOODCRC\n965415.362336 SRC/4 [196f]VDM Vff00:DISCSVID,INI:ff008002\n965415.363836 SNK/2 [144f]VDM Vff00:DISCSVID,NAK:ff008082\n965415.916464 SNK/3 [1642]REQUEST{2} 200320c8\n[965415.918361 PD TMOUT RX 581/582]\nRXERR SOP\n965415.919653 TMOUT\n965416.009340 SNK/6 [0c41]GOODCRC\n\nThe two interesting lines above are the SRCCAP, which is \"Source Capabilities\" where the charger sends to the Chromebook the list of available voltage and current limits it supports. Secondly, the \"REQUEST{2}\" from the sink is the Chromebook Pixel choosing the second voltage level from the menu of the sources' capabilities, indicating it is requesting the 14.8V level.\n\nAs we can see, Twinkie confirms that the charger is supplying 14.4V at 2A through the BlackSquid cable to the laptop:\n> tw vbus\nVBUS = 14407 mV ; -1989 mA\n> tw cc\nCC1 = 941 mV ; CC2 = 0 mV\n\nThe final charger is actually LG's Type-C docking station + 4K monitor. Let's plug it in via the Black Squid cable and see what Pixel thinks :\nlocalhost / # ectool --dev 1 usbpdpower\nPort 0: Disconnected\nPort 1: SNK Charger PD 17612mV / 3000mA, max 19000mV / 3000mA / 57000mW\n\nIt's negotiated to 17V charging with this display at 3A.\n> tw vbus\nVBUS = 17652 mV ; -3001 mA\n\nAt the same time as fast charging, the display also turned on and Pixel drove the external display at full 4K resolution (3840x2160) at 60Hz. I also confirmed that a keyboard and mouse attached to the display's integrated USB hub work too.\n\nFor a USB 2.0 High Speed data test, Ive hooked my Nexus 5X to my Chromebook Pixel via the BlackSquid Type-C cable to test large file transfer via MTP. It just works, no problem!\n\nFor a USB 3.1 SuperSpeed data test, I've hooked up my Chromebook Pixel to a SuperSpeed Type-C external drive enclosure :<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/ORICO-Aluminum-Tool-Free-Type-C-USB-3-0-to-SATA-III-External-Hard-Drive-Enclosure-for-2-5-inch-HDD-SSD-Optimized-For-SSD-Support-UASP-Silver-2598C3/dp/B015KMR0CI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">ORICO Aluminum Tool Free Type C USB 3.0 to SATA III External Hard Drive Enclosure for 2.5 inch HDD/SSD [ Optimized For SSD, Support UASP ] Silver (2598C3)</a>&nbsp;I confirmed when attached to my Chromebook Pixel via the Black Squid cable that it enumerates at SuperSpeed, indicating that the cable definitely has the required extra wires to support the faster operation.\n\nI have also done a 4-wire measurement of impedance on Vbus and Gnd using a bench LCR meter to see if this cable is within spec for IR Drop (Section 4.4.1 of the Type-C spec) :\nVbus : 0.132 -> 0.396mV\nGnd  : 0.071 -> 0.213mV\nThese are within the limits of 500mV for Vbus and 250mV for Gnd! Very good! This cable will not cause excessively slow charging.\n\nFor other more subjective judgements of this cable : Just like the last BlackSquid cable that I reviewed, I am impressed with just how thin this cable is considering it has, at a minimum, 15 separate wires inside. The actual cable diameter is even thinner than some USB 2.0 cables I have seen, and the cable is still very flexible. Both Type-C plugs are of the stamped kind, which is good, but not great. Other cables including ones from Google and Apple use a deep-draw extrusion method to build the plugs, which is stronger and nicer looking. Overall, I am impressed with Black Squid's fit and finish with this cable.\n\nIn conclusion, Black Squid's Full-Featured Type-C cable is an excellent full featured cable that shows the promise of Type-C use cases to come. Using this single cable, I was able to fast charge my laptop while simultaneously displaying 4k60 video to and accessing a USB hub on an external display. Well done!", "summary": "Black Squid's 3ft Full Featured Type-C cable is spec compliant and excellent for docking use cases!", "unixReviewTime": 1460419200}

This is true of my old Samsung Focus and a friend's new Samsung Flash.  We were at a car show and while I was tapping the screen of my Lumia 900 (with 8mp Carl Zeiss lens) and focusing and seeing what I was taking pictures of, he was blindly pressing his camera button and tapping his screen, in hopes that he actually took a picture.  Then, we wanted to see what the date was in 2 weeks.  He absolutely could not view his screen and see his calendar.  My Nokia was easily readable and we had to use my phone to look up a date, settle a bet on the amount of horsepower the Ferrari we were snapping pics of and find the closest Starbucks to redeem the bet. :)\n\nFaster than my Samsung Focus:\n-------------------------------\nWe have an IP camera over the crib of our newborn.  I used to use my Samsung Focus as a baby monitor and 50% of the time, the app that I use would give timeout messages and or take a few seconds to start streaming a picture.  With my Nokia Lumia 900, not a single timeout message and the app streams a picture immediately (we know this because it displays the current hour-minute-SECONDS).  I double-know this because my wife also has a Samsung Focus and she has the same timeout issues.  3G (Focus)/4G (Lumia900) is not a factor because both phones use the same WIFI network in the house.\n\nSpeaks Caller ID/Spoken Text Messages and DICTATION:\n------------------------------------------------------\nOkay, this may not be exclusive to the Nokia Lumia 900, but rather, Windows Phone 7.5 that bring spoken caller-id (can be turned off) when someone calls you as well as spoken text messages as part of the phone, not an app you have to buy.

First is that the buttons lose the responsiveness that not having a case or having a case with open buttons has. Also, sometimes pushing the volume button pushes both at the same time, causing the volume to go back and forth between two values, e.g., 27/28.

I like the bumper style because the other two piece styles tend to slide off when I pull them out of my pocket and those frustrate me.  This case looks nice and goes on well, but like many cases of this nature it does take some work to get off.  I'm okay with that because once I put a case on, it's not going to come off for a while.  (I don't tend to swap cases to match my outfit, or because I feel like it, or because it's raining, etc.)  The one real problem with this case is that the mute/vibrate button is very difficult to use.  This is going to cause a problem for a lot of people.  Personally it's not an issue for me because my phone is always on vibrate and I never toggle that switch, however it is a design flaw so I knocked off a star for that.  All features of a phone should be accessible through a case, whether one uses them or not.\n\nThe color is very pretty and I actually like the little textured dots on the clear part inside.  It gives it a swiss dot look that I find very sweet.  It's very understated and you have to almost look for it, but it is there.  It lets the beauty of your phone's color show through but adds a little extra femininity to it.\n\nI'm a dropper and have never had any trouble with these types of cases protecting my phone.  The bumper absorbs all the impact usually, and the way the case fits, there's a lip around the face of the phone so the phone can't land flat on its face.  I do have a Zagg glass screen protector as well, and this fits fine with that.", "summary": "Mute toggle button is a problem", "unixReviewTime": 1465603200}

The design seems to be printed on the case very well, with other cases I have worried the design would bend or flake off over time but this seems very well made. The inside part of the case that holds the phone is a snug fit and the plastic material it is made of seems very durable. When I get phone cases I often worry that the plastic or the case itself will wear over time and loosen to the point where it doesnt hold the case in, but that doesnt seem to be a concern because this seems pretty solid. As an added bonus this case comes with a Stylus and a screen protector. The screen protector was easy to apply and came with a cloth to wipe down the phone. I would certainly recommend this case to others. The quality cant be beat at this price.

There are two small uncovered glass portions on each vertical edge of the screen that do not get covered by the protector.  But there's a reason for that.  Due to the nature of the screen and the curvature of the phone, static cling screen protectors do not actually fully adhere to those edges of the glass.  So the way this protector is designed is actually ideal--it covers the entire active area of the display, but is small enough that it also fully adheres to the screen and does not have bubbles around the edges.\n\nI've tried several screen protectors for the Droid Mini.

Well, if you truly scratch at the back/front, \"like you want to scratch the case\" the films will start to tear and come off. The case looks 10X better now. It's a nice clear scratch resistant case.

However, this process does take longer because the item ships from China rather than from an Amazon warehouse.

The color is a bit different than the watch itself, but I feel that it looks better than silver would. Though the adapters were rose gold, the silver buckle was not customized, so I switched it out myself for a rose gold buckle from a band I don't use. You can also buy buckles at various online retailers if you are bothered by the buckle color not matching the adapters.\n\nI'm not sure whether or not the band is leather or faux leather, but it is flexible and comfortable. It looks like the design was printed onto the band somehow, and there's even a bit of a 3D effect with different layers of ink and paint, which looks nice. The design is only on the top of the band, while the bottom is white.\n\nOverall, I am satisfied with my purchase at this time.

The presentation of the product is near Apple presentation.  Nice box and Sleeve and it is pretty apparent that this is a quality product.  Having said that it seems that purchasers who own the 25W watt unit are not as happy as those who purchased the 40 watt unit.  The 25 watt unit requires specific ports for different devices. iOS, Android, Samsung, etc.  There is an explanation next to the USB ports on the front, and a output chart on the back of the unit where the AC plug is attached.  This is not the case with the 40 watt charger.\n\nThere are no diagrams and/or charts on the black charger.  The only print on the black charger is the brand name and the S/N sticker.  The output diagram on the bottom of the unit state that a single port can deliver up to 8 amps.  This is regulated by the demand of the device plugged into the USB port.  Each USB is microchip so there is no danger of overcharging or under charging the device plugged into the charger.\n\nAnker call the microchip ports \"SMART PORTS\" on the 40 watt unit.  Basically you can plug any device into any USB port in any combination(s) because the ports are not hard wired for specific types of electronic devices.  That is what is stated in the clear instructions and it is working out just great.\n\nI have not used the 25 watt unit but I guess to preserve your sanity, if charging more than one device I would spring the couple extra $$ for the 40 watt unit.  Currently there is a $6 difference between the two unit's prices.  I am very happy with the unit and would buy it again in a heartbeat.  If there is one thing I would like to see on a future improvement it would be a LED on the charger to indicate that it is receiving AC power but this is just a small observation and certainly no show stopper.\n\nUpdate:\n\nIt has just come to my attention while viewing this charger on Amazon that the white version is available in both the 25W and 40W variety.  I had previously missed this, or the white version just became available.  Therefore if the black version is sold out, which at the moment it is then feel free to order the white version if you have no preference on colors", "summary": "Awesome Charger.

It is made out of soft plastic/rubber like material or TPU which makes it very easy to hold and not slippery at all. The side buttons are covered but very easy to press and very responsive. The flip switch is open but I don't mind. The charging cut out is precise and rounded so no sharp edges or burrs from manufacturing process. I feel like this can protect my wife's phone without a problem, but I don't want to really test it out just yet...overall, very nice case.\nOne compliment to the packaging, it is really nicely packaged. Unlike other low cost case that comes in simple clear sleeve, this case came in with nice box with magnetic side open door and clear window. The case is even fitted on the dummy mold that holds the case in the middle of the case. It is a very nicely designed box. I am keeping it for storing my cards!", "summary": "Nice case with very nice packaging", "unixReviewTime": 1452729600}

Pairing is a piece of cake and the feature of the phone re-pairing after being turned on works flawlessly.  The battery saving feature where it shuts off automatically also works great.\n\nThis product would be 5 stars in my book if the volume was louder.  Note that volume *level* is controlled by either the phone or the unit, but the volume *output* is limited by the unit' amp and speaker.  For all but the absolute quietest situations, the volume is simply not loud enough for reliable use in a car.  Even sitting on my desk as a speakerphone, the volume is insufficient if there is any level of background noise.\n\nNoise canceling and sound quality (from my callers' perspective) is very good, but unfortunately, both of these units were a waste of my money because they are really only barely usable in a car setting.  Both my wife and I have switched to headsets for use in the car - much less convenient, but much better audio quality.\n\nFor some reason I cannot change the # of stars I originally assigned, but it should be a two-star product, not 4 stars...", "summary": "Easy operation but not loud enough!", "unixReviewTime": 1216080000}

The second time I dropped it in the crystal clear case and the case cracked. But again, my phone was fine. While I'm disappointed that the crystal clear case now has an ugly crack on it, it did save my phone, so I guess it did its job!\n\nFour star rating because on the blue/pink case, the pink color picks up the dye from my jeans and always looks dirty until I wipe it clean with an alcohol prep pad. And 4 stars for the clear case because it's kind of \"brittle\". I cracked it by the camera hole trying to take it off my phone for the first time, and then of course the way it cracked when I dropped it. The crystal clear material doesn't have that little bit of give and flexibility that the plastic Otterbox cases have. It's a trade off for the looks.

I've been doing more research to better understand the various USB wall chargers and trying various types to see what works best for my family. This one you can plug up to 4 USB devices in at once, however you want to be sure you are using the proper slot for each type of device. The top two are for devices that need a stronger charger like tablets and the bottom two are better for smaller devices like phones. Also important are the cords that you use, this does not come with any cords so I highly recommend you use the cord that came with your device. If you plug a weaker cord into the top ports it will still give you a slower weaker charge. You can use any of the four ports and still get a charge on your device without harming it, it's all a matter of speed, a tablet is going to take FOREVER on the lower two!\n\nThis is white, and though blocky it is not a super eyesore like the power strips that we have been using to plug in multiple devices. This will be great when we have visitors so that they can plug their cords in and be ready to charge. Each family member in the household has 1-4 devices that charge via USB so it's nice to have these multiport chargers around the house so that we can use them when needed without having to prioritize which device (or family member) needs the outlet first!\n\nI am giving this device a full five stars because it is exactly as described and also shown in pictures. However a couple things to take note of if you are looking at purchasing it. It will not fit behind a dresser/couch/etc unless it is pulled away from the wall. It plugs into the wall fully sticking out about plus room for the cord to plug in so you are going to need probably 4-5 inches of clearance in front of it. So unless you are plugging it into an outlet in a more open space this will not work for you if you need something in front of the plug. It could work under tables and along open walls with no problems. It's a couple inches wide as well, the size and weight at this time isn't pulling it out of the outlet yet and it is staying firm for us, but if you have loose outlets again this might be a problem. I really wish the person who designed this would have taken those things into consideration and flipped it so that the wall plug was on a side with more surface area keeping it closer to the wall when plugged in. It would also give it a slimmer profile and help so that people wouldn't need as much clearance around it. The ideal use for this is designed would probably be floor outlets, which don't exist in most buildings and even then usually only commercial buildings.\n\nWe will continue to use it as I said it works well for what it is. We have it plugged in near a couch on a wall that has some clearance between the wall and couch so it won't be blocked by anything.", "summary": "It is good and works, but the design is kind of awkward.", "unixReviewTime": 1430870400}

My first impression when I opened the package and looked at the screen protector was surprise. The protector itself seemed thick! The company says it is actual glass and perhaps it is, I couldn't say by feel alone but it is definitely not cheap flimsy plastic either. I followed the instructions on cleaning my screen and once I placed the glass screen protector on the tablet it seemed to almost set itself as I watched all of the air bubbles but one magically dissolve. One stubborn one stayed on the bottom edge but I lifted the edge slightly allowing it to release and it was gone. All the functions for my Galaxy 4 work fine with the screen protector in place and so far I see no finger prints being left behind as I use it. The protector I had previously, I admit I forgot was on there because there were so many finger prints on the screen I just assumed I never applied one!

Dick", "reviewText": "Let's face it, there's nothing flashy or particularly exciting about a wall charger. The most important thing is performance. So, I ran some tests to see how the performance of the EasyAcc 5V 2A Micro USB Travel Charger compares to some other chargers I own.  For each test, I ran the battery on my HTC One M9 down to 30% capacity then charged for 30 minutes with the screen off.\n\nThe performance of the EasyAcc was very impressive. My phone increased 21% over 30 minutes which is fantastic. The only chargers that outperformed the EasyAcc were my two chargers that have Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 technology. Please note that Quick Charge technology only applies if you have a device that supports the technology.\n\nHere are the results of each test:\n\n* Motorola adapter and 6 ft cable: 8% increase\n* Amazon 1A adapter and 3 ft cable: 14% increase\n* Amazon 1A adapter and 6 ft cable: 14% increase\n* My most powerful 2A portable charger: 21% increase\n* EasyAcc 5V 2A Micro USB Travel Charger: 21% increase\n* Car charger with Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 technology: 30% increase\n* Wall charger with Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 technology: 34% increase\n\nHere is a summary of the pros and cons with this charger:\n\nPros:\n1) The 2 amp output provides a quicker charge than a standard charger. It's not as fast as Qualcomm's Quick Charge 2.0 technology but it's very impressive.\n2) The cord is 5.5' long! This makes it great to use as a bedside charger and can also help for travel in case the outlet in your hotel room isn't in a convenient location.\n\nCons:\nThe only negative things I can think of about this charger are a bit petty. One is that it is a somewhat bulky and the other is that the cord is hardwired.\n\nI highly recommend this charger for anyone looking for a powerful micro USB charger.\n\nPlease note that I received a free sample of this product from EasyAcc in exchange for this review.", "summary": "Great value for a powerful charger", "unixReviewTime": 1448150400}

I was using a S6 for this and it has a pretty thick otterbox case on it and it was able to charge it.  It only had the blue led though.  I didn't see the orange come on but that could be the wall plug I was using too.  It also has to be placed right on it to charge.  If you're a little off it won't work.\n\nOverall its a good budget charger just make sure your phone is compatible.  I have a S5 and now I want to buy the QI adapter for my S5 to see if it will charge it.\n\nThe only con so far is that it doesnt come with the wall adapter.  It kind of defeats the point of having another charger if you have to use your other wall plug.  I also think it would solve some of the issues other people might have with getting it to work with their phone.

Another potential concern is the small loop of slack cable that has to be left if you want to remove the charging connector so you can use the micro-usb port for data transfers.

And let me say that these do not disappoint! They are beautiful vibrant colored and also provide good protection to your apple watch.\n\nI own a 42 mm and when i got the package i was upset to see the 38 mm case sent to me. However, i realised that I had made a mistake while placing the order. So i requested the sellers to send me a replacement 42mm sized cases. And they happily obliged and i received the one i wanted in a couple of days. I was very happy with their customer service.\n\nOne suggestion with this case. If you have a screen protector with full coverage on your apple watch or if you are installing one at the same time as you are getting this case then make sure you install the screen protector and then wait at least a couple days before placing this case on. If the screen protector is not well settled on the watch this may pull it off when you take off the case. If the protector is installed properly this should not cause much problems with it. You can also change bands with the case on without any problems.\n\nDefinitely recommended to all apple watch owners!", "summary": "Great looking vibrant colored cases.

So I am taking a minute  to correct my earlier feed back in regards to the iPhone 6 plus case. First it is just a back piece that covers the back of the phone. I really like the case, the color is exactly what I was looking for. The material has some flexibility, and seems tough enough to handle everyday use.

Provides good enough protection for the phone as well.\nGives your phone the extra juice when required. At a press of a button you will know the remaining charge in the battery\nHas a Micro-USB port to charge the case(Dislike for me) as i have to carry 2 usb cables now.\n\nWould i use it daily? NO..Definitely NO..\nIMHO, this is best suited when you travel or it is a necessity for someone who is always on the go. This case will be very handy for such cases where you are out the entire day and it will give the extra boost when your iPhone is about to run out of battery.\n\nPros\nVery very Sleek and adds very less bulk to your sleek iphone\nThe case(bumper) has different colors to choose from (Go ahead customize your phone). I just went for a simple Black one.\nEasy to use installation\nThe case in itself charges fairly quickly.\nCharges the iPhone fairly quickly (still need to test the numbers claimed by Mota- Will update my review if i anything odd)\nComes in a nice packaging and Instructions.\n\nCons\nThe bumper part of the case needs to be removed every time you need to install the iPhone. This bumper is the weak point according to me. Just after two times of installing and removing the phone, the bumper case squeaks and is lose in some places now. Check my attached pics.\nThe case itself needs a Micro-USB cable. I feel the USB slot on the case is a little clumsy(has a cheap feel to it). Cable won't fit fine and i feel the slot/port might break easily if i am not careful.\nSupplied micro-USB cable is kind of short\nHave to carry an extra head phone jack with this case(Mota does provides this jack, but i don't like extra junk with me)\nIt is pricey case. Form the quality and whole device feel.. i wish it could have costed a little less.\nSummary\nThis case is not for everyday use and not for everyone(mainly because of the price). If you travel a lot or infact if you use your phone a lot (i.e drain the huge iPhone 6+ battery in half a day) then this is FOR YOU.\nSo IMHO, think about your needs before buying.\n\nThe case in itself is absolutely fine (even with the cons that i suggested above). It is a MOTA device, their customer service is great, they are always there for your help. I am Happy with the case so far...", "summary": "Juice when u need it!

The outer plastic shell is flimsy and the inner runner case feels more on the plastic side than rubber.  However it does its job - it covers the phone.  I was attracted to this case solely on its design.  I loved the white on gray color.  Another reason I chose this case was because there was no face plate.  I hate faceplates because they interfere with the touch type effect of the smartphone.  The case fits very snuggly.  The outer plast shell fits perfectly.  It shows no signs of detaching from the runner inner case. Now since I was able to purchase this item at a discounted rate for the purposes of product review I will say this - the only thing I did not like about the case was the inner rubber case has a huge whole for a back.  This made no sense to me because over time you do get dirt, dust, and liquids on your phone and thats a good place for them to build up first.  Cosmetically you cannot see this without taking off the plastic outer shell.  But knowing this does not put my mind at ease.  I prefer to keep my phone scratch, scuff, mark free for as long as I own this phone.  Overall it does the job and looks great.  The only exposed areas are the silent button, plug-ins, carmera, and speaker, all other buttons are covered.  Its very light so there is basically no added weight from using this case.  That is a definite plus, the iPhone 6 plus is big and heavy enough no need to make it feel like a brick.

It came in a sealed package, which is always good to know it comes in brand new packaging. I love the color, even though mine is a little more on the green side, and not so much teal as pictured. This case comes in 3 pieces; a solid black hard rubber that covers the back, and then the teal/green shell that goes over that- and the belt clip case as well. The case fits very nicely, and leaves all ports and holes open and easily accessible. I am confident that if i drop my phone, this case will protect it. One of the things i like most, is that the black body cover has a lip over the front of the screen, so that if i were to drop my phone screen side down, the lip will protect this screen from getting any scratches or damage to it. The belt clip took me a minute to figure out, i couldn't get the phone to stay put, it kept sliding out, so make sure you put the belt clip on the front of the phone, facing the screen. I'm not sure why i tried to put it on the back side but it doesn't work like that. This is a very sturdy and stylish case, and i love that it fits my LGK7 phone just as it should!\nI received this for free or at a discount for my honest and unbiased review of this item.

Wood", "reviewText": "Over the past few years, I've become a collector of Bluetooth headsets for my phones.  I did not intend to start a collection.  Most were adequate, but all had some key flaw that just made it too much of a bother to use for one reason or another.\n\nThe Jabra STORM Bluetooth headset will be the last in my \"collection,\" and I can finally get rid of all the others.  This one is perfect for me.\n\nTo start with, it looks good.  Not the key reason to get one for me, or to get rid of one, but it's a nice plus.  It feels good when you wear it, which is a major plus and why a couple of my previous headsets are out the door.  It connects well with my phone, and very easily.  Comes up as \"Jabra STORM\" on the Bluetooth menu, instead of \"LRx335.5a\" or some such nonsense.  Again, not really a showstopper, but it makes me happy.  It works very well.  Friends, family, and business partners can all easily understand me without having to shout or change my normal speaking voice, and I can understand all of them.  This is a critical issue, and the STORM delivers very, very well.\n\nBut for me, the thing that drives it home is power management.  I only use a headset when in the car, or occasionally when I'm expecting an important call and otherwise will have my hands busy.  So having a battery that lasts a long time is very important, and the STORM delivers.  I can talk for hours if I need to, such as on a long car drive.  Once charged, if I turn it off it will keep a charge for over a month, even with intermittent use.  One big reason it can do that is because it has a physical on-off switch.  Seriously, why can't more headsets do that?  It doesn't waste the battery that way, and I don't hear a quiet voice or beep hours later after I use it when it's trying to connect to a phone that isn't there...you can actually turn the headset off.  I absolutely love that!\n\nAre there phones out there that do some feature better?  Sure, heck I have a couple.  Some are smaller, some look better, some sound better, others have cool features I'll never use but they sound good at the time.  But overall, I haven't found a better headset, and I can finally stop searching.

Those are just bad habits.  In fact, in the past, I've used the phone so little that I had begun asking myself if maybe I just don't need one since I have my iPad and prefer to e-mail, text, or use Facetime.  I easily send more photos with e-mails to my friends and family members than I call.\n\nHolding the phone to my ear is tiresome, I can't do anything else while I'm using the phone that way, and the other ear pieces I've used were uncomfortable both to wear and listen to.\n\nSince I've been using this Jabra model, all that has changed.  I've been talking on the phone more, as I should, and this device frees me up on ways I didn't expect.\n\nThe range is amazing.  Using my iPhone 5, I can place the phone anywhere and I have no signal problems walking around without the phone anywhere else in my home.\n\nI can lay down with it, even resting on the ear I have the device on, without any discomfort, even after a long conversation.\n\nAnd the sound is as clear as it is when holding the iPhone to my ear.\n\nA full charge gives you two hours of talk time, and all you have to do to find out how much time you have left is press the button on the end of the earpiece--a voice will actually say \"Your remaining talk time is ____ hours.\"  A good amount of time before it runs out of power, it gives you a warning--which I forget because it has only happened once.\n\nThe 'stone' the earpiece sits in charges the earpiece, so most of the time you don't need to plug it into an outlet, just insert it into the stone and the three indicator lights on the stone will tell you how much of a charge is left before you need to plug that back into a wall outlet or USB port.\n\nLastly, both in terms of safety and comfort, I like how this device gives you 'in ear' sound quality but doesn't block your ear from hearing other things around you--which is my key issue with wearing one while driving or hiking.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: I've finally converted to being a wireless earpiece user--though of course I still won't be abusing it with bad habits like talking on the phone while on trains or walking down the street.", "summary": "A Re-Review: I underestimated how much I would like and use this thing", "unixReviewTime": 1376438400}

I used to run my main PC with two external HDD shared out and then a laptop connected to each TV. This worked great but was inefficient and consumed a lot of power. Since my main TV was smart and had Hulu/YouTube apps, I decided to configure my Pi with Raspbmc and to ditch my main PC with the Pogoplug Series 4 using Debian and Samba as a file server. My power bill dropped enough to make it worth the 60$ spent on the Pi and the 20$ spent on the Pogoplug.\n\nHere is why I used Pogoplug and why the Pi isn't an end all solution for HTPC solutions: So the Pi B splits it's Ethernet connection with the USB bus (which is limited to USB 2.0 so your network bandwidth and USB bandwidth are shared). This made XBMC significantly slower when reading movies/tv shows even when the external HDD was connected directly to the device. So by switching to the Pogoplug as my file server I not only reduced the amount of buffering the Pi needs to stream a video, I now have a device that is capable of USB 3.0 and has Gigabit Ethernet (for whenever I get a router capable of 1gbps).  Now I can access file shares, movies, and manage downloads without having my Raspberry Pi as a bottleneck.\n\nThere are other great applications that the Raspberry Pi can be used for and it's a great little gadget to learn Linux.  Certainly happy with my purchase. The biggest downside is no native flash support and even when you can get it to work, it is unusable as the Pi just doesn't have enough processing power to handle flash.", "summary": "...

It is a powerful battery pack rated at 8000 mAh of capacity and the test results were good! I put together a video of the unit and the test results for your review.\n\nThe battery weighs in at 6 7/8 ounces. The battery pack has one USB output port that outputs 5 VDC at 1 Amp and a second USB port that outputs 2.1 Amps.  During the testing the temperature of the battery pack never even exceeded ambient room temperature. To start your phone or device charging you connect it with the proper cable and press the battery power button. To check the battery pack charge status you have to press the battery power button and the LEDs on the front light up.\n\nThis product is good and I rate it at 5 stars. If you are a business person or a student and have to depend on your tablet or smart phone for long periods of time without the ability to get to an AC power source then this is a good battery to own. This is good for those who travel a lot or camp out. Now you can watch your movies or listen to your music on those long airline flights. While this battery pack can put some charge into your tablets it is more ideal for use in recharging your smart phone. Because of its size it is great to drop into a purse, briefcase or a pocket.\n\nYou should note that I did not operate my tablets or phones while I charged it but the WIFI and phone transmitter were left on. When I test a battery I do an extensive set of tests that fully charges the battery and then I use it to charge devices and make sure that it is fully depleted when my tests are done. I time each test and document the results as the test progresses. I then calculate the mAh of capacity that the battery supplied and I then calculate its charging efficiency. This process takes from 3 hours to, in very large batteries, about a day for testing. I don't take any short cuts or guess and every battery has these tests performed on it and documented. This is to assure that the battery is tested and it performs well. If a battery has performed poorly I then run the tests again to verify the results.\n\nItems in the box:\n* The UNU Enerpak 8000 mAh battery\n* The battery pack comes with an instruction manual.\n* A USB charging cable that is 32 inches long.\n* You may have to use the charging cable that comes with many of your own devices.\n* The unit does not come with a USB AC charging power source.\n\nUNU Enerpak 8000 mAh External Battery Pack Features:\n* Powerful 8000 mAh capacity\n* The unit is compact and weighs in at 6 7/8 ounces.\n* Attractive design with a black exterior.\n* The specifications and ports are nicely labeled on the case.\n* It has 3 LED status lights located on the front that indicate the battery charge level. When you see one red LED the battery is between 5 and 33 %, 2 green LEDs is 33 to 66 %, 3 blue LEDs is 66 to 100%.\n* There is one USB power output rated at 5 VDC and 1 Amp labeled Smartphones and a second USB port rated at 2.1 Amps that is labeled Tablets.\n* You can charge two items at the same time.\n* When you plug in a device then press the charging button to start the process of charging your device.\n* The battery pack uses Lithium-ion battery technology.\n* The battery pack can be recharged 500+ times\n* Warranty is 12 months\n* The battery pack does not come with an AC wall charger. It is specified to be charged with 5 VDC at 1 amp. That manual states that you can use a 2.1 Amp power source and I recommend that you use 2.1 Amps.  The manual specifies that it will take 8 to 10 hours to charge the battery with a 1Amp power source.\n* The battery pack features a dual LED flashlight that can be turned on by double pressing the on button twice quickly and it can be turned off by double pressing the off button twice quickly. This is a nice feature to use when looking for your keys, finding a seat in a dark theater or while in a dark unfamiliar hotel room at night and looking for a light switch.  It is also good for emergencies.\n\nTest charging devices to measure the output capacity:\nI fully charged the battery pack and it was at 3 blue LEDs of charge capacity. My test iPad 2 was at 8%.\n* 30 min iPad at 17% 4 LEDs\n* 60 min iPad at 27% 4 LEDs\n* 90 min iPad at 36% 3 LEDs\n* We charged the iPad 2 overnight and in the morning it was at 93% and the battery pack was dead\n\nSummary of charging tests:\n* Charge an iPad 2 85% x 6944 = 5902.4 mAh\n\n* Test result = 5902.4 mAh/8000 mAh = 74% efficiency\n* That is a good efficiency result for this battery.\n\nHere are some common devices and the amount of mAh of capacity they have when they are fully charged. This is just to give you an impression of how much energy it takes to charge your smart device:\n\n* iPhone 4 battery 1,420 mAh battery capacity\n* iPhone 4S battery 1,432 mAh battery capacity\n* iPhone 5 battery 1440 mAh battery capacity\n* iPhone 5S battery 1560 mAh battery capacity\n* iPad 2 battery 6,944 mAh battery capacity\n* iPad 3 battery 11,560 mAh battery capacity\n* Kindle Fire battery 4400 mAh capacity\n* Kindle Keyboard battery 1750 mAh capacity\n* iPad 4 battery is 11,486 mAh 3.7 VDC at 42.5 Wh\n* iPad Mini battery is 4490 mAh at 3.72 VDC 16.7 Wh\n\nAs you can see the UNU Enerpak  8000 will not fully charge a totally dead iPad 2, 3 or 4 because it only contains 8000 mAh of capacity. You have to consider the losses in the charging circuits of both the battery pack and the device you are charging. When using an external battery you have to allow approximately 30 % of the battery capacity will be lost to heat, voltage conversion, powering the batteries electronics and the electronics of your electronics device's charging circuits. In addition you have to consider that your device is not truly off like a cell phone is still connected to the WIFI and phone networks and probably receiving emails, etc.\n\nReal world examples of charging capability with this battery pack:\n* iPhone 4 approximately 416% of a full charge out of a fully charged UNU Enerpak  8000 mAh battery pack\n* iPhone 5S approximately 378% of a full charge\n* iPad 2 approximately 85% of a full charge\n* iPad 3 or 4 approximately 51% of a full charge\n* iPad Mini approximately 131% of a full charge\n* Kindle Fire approximately 134% of a full charge\n\n* A normal estimated usable storage is 70% of capacity or .70 * 8000 mAh = 5600 mAh charging capacity available for your electronic devices.\n* In my testing I was able to use approximately 5719.76 mAh of capacity or roughly 74% of the 8000 mAh capacity. This is a good result.\n\nI received a sample product for evaluation and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.", "summary": "A good battery with solid test results!", "unixReviewTime": 1384214400}

If you think the Defender might be too bulky (it is very bulky) and the Symmetry not protective enough (it really is but it doesn't promise 2-layer protection), then THIS is the Otterbox case for you.\n\nWhile the Defender feels obese and quite heavy, the Commuter manages to be pretty light weight despite only remove one piece (the front/screen protector piece) that the Defender has. The pieces themselves are also MUCH lighter than the Defender pieces and like the Defender, it provides port covers to keep stuff out of your phone. (I almost found the two pieces too fragile and light in my hands.) The rubbery piece is very lightweight, much, much lighter than the Symmetry and not as protective without the inner plastic piece. The Commuter definitely FEELS like and is the budget version of the other sturdier Otterbox cases.\n\nI think this is the case most people would be happy with if they're not completely klutzes and if they don't necessarily carry their phones in their pockets...though this is a pretty easy fit in your pocket though not as light and small as the slimmer Symmetry.\n\nI got this in Bespoke Way because the color is more uniform and more stylish than the black case.

My best friend swears by this but my money (and yes, you spend more) is with the Defender, Strada or Symmetry cases. For a phone as big as the iPhone 7 Plus, I have to recommend the Symmetry and Strada but if you need to save money then the Commuter since you'll need to buy a screen protector separately is your best bet.", "summary": "Happy Medium between Defender and Symmetry on a Budget", "unixReviewTime": 1483833600}

This case is perfect for a night out where you don't have to worry about lugging around a wallet, but can keep this case and your ID/cards all in one convenient place. What I also like about it is how easy it is to install your phone. Many cases of this caliber require a lot of prodding and pressing just to get your phone inside of it, and don't even get me started on taking it out. This case provides an easy means to both install and remove your phone, which is a bonus add on.\n\nOverall I Like the material, the look, and the protective capabilities of the case.

I let my phone drain down to 1% and fully charged the battery and turned it on. It charged the phone to 100% and still had 1 light left. It won't get you two full charges but still probably performs better than anything else on the market.\n\nOne thing I don't like is that the battery turns off when the charge reaches 100% and doesn't trickle charge to keep it at 100%. I think this battery is best used once you hit around 50% and you turn it on to keep your phone charged.\n\nIt's a bit hard to take on and off so it's not recommended to be easily swapped in and out with another case. The rugged case is extremely durable. This case is perfect for someone who works in the field and has to be on their phone constantly. If you're a light user who sits in an office I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nLast thing, if you took out the battery you can put a few credit card and cash into the cavity you could use it as a secret compartment.", "summary": "Extended Battery!", "unixReviewTime": 1421452800}

I have no complaint. The speed is usable for my iOS devices.\n\nThe only negative is that the data packages now being offered are different to those offered at the outset. There no longer appears to be a 3GB global package, but there is one for HK and China combined at about $30\n\nWhile there are packages in Asia combining certain countries, there are no specific European packages meaning you have to buy a global package. The Global package is a single 1GB one and the price is now much higher than I paid before.\n\nI guess the reason for this is that the manufacturer is China/HK based.\n\nThe concept of this device is great. A single device that works when you get off the plane anywhere in the world. But it needs sensible pricing and right  sized data packages. And availability of the device seems very limited and I could not find it for sale in HK. I'd buy a G2 which is a 4G device that also accepts local SIM cards if I could find one. Guess I will have to buy one in the USA when I get back\n\nI upped the rating to 4 ****\n\n=====================================================\nI bought this item to replace an unlocked wifi device and a handful of SIM's for both Europe and Asia.\n\nMy first experience was to use it in the USA by way of an initial test. It connected OK to the network and provided data. The speeds were very low and in my opinion not useable for normal email retrieval and web browsing was not useful\n\nI ran quite a number of  speedtests in a number of locations over a 2-3 week period. In my home town I use ATT and can get impressive service on my cellphone, but the best I got on the G1 was under 2- 3Mbs download and 1Mb upload and the test reported using ATT as the carrier.  In Las Vegas - the same - situation with really low speeds. I am sure that this is not a limitation of the hardware but rather that of the roaming terms with the various providers that the internal SIM locks onto.\n\nThe unit itself is robust and quite chunky but not obtrusive.

Great work Spigen!\n\nUPDATE 2 weeks of use: I used this case almost 2 weeks without a screen protector on the phone, and I just tried 2 different brands and types of screen protectors (1 soft film, 1 tempered/hardened) and this case is NOT friendly to screen protectors. Stupid me, didn't read all the reviews, plenty of people have mentioned this, I should've read more carefully.  I still really like this case, but due to the S7 Edge's curved screen, this case will NOT protect the screen. So using a screen protector (like I have withe every phone ever owned) is proving very difficult, it interferes with the edges of the case and start peeling up/off as soon as you put the case on.

I tried the Otter Box Defender case but sent it back because it doubles the thickness of the phone.  My wife is also happy with the otter box Commuter.

This combo comes with 10050 mAh capacity and 1 USB outputs 5V = 2.4A, 9V = 2A, 12V = 1.5A PowerBank with IQ Technology, Qualcomm 2.0 quick charger and cloth mess bag (which i am not big fan of, more about that later in review).\n\nThe package comes with PowerCore+ 10050 mAh battery with LED indicator makes the product look futuristic. I love LED indicator on this product compare to other out there with color coding. You really have to remember what % represents Green , Blue and Red. So far this is my favorite product in terms of LED battery indicator. Some people may feel battery pack little bulky but for 10050 mAh capacity, weight is justified. Overall, battery packs looks and feels good. It doesn't feel like plastic or made form cheap material. The power pack color is matt black with non-shiny surface which I liked a lot. The package also includes micro USB cable and Qualcomm 2.0 quick wall charger for quick charge time. I was bale to charge my iPhone almost 3 times with one full charge cycle.\n\nI was not expecting a carrying cases like this. It is little flimsy mesh cloth bag; the battery pack, charger and cable snugly fits inside.. I really like to keep all the contents inside the bag however hard case would have been better for protection. I have seen better cases out there. Since, carrying case was included for free, there is not much to complaint about.\n\nOverall, Anker PowerCore+ Quick Charge Combo pack is a very nice set of devices perfect for travelling. Each component is of high quality and performs very well.\n\nAll in all, very solid Combo Package and I would hope to see Anker starts doing more of this to help users pair the proper products that compliment each other. It can get quite confusing with different Quick Charges (2.0/3.0) and which products they are compatible with.\nI have received the item at a reduced price in return for an fair and unbiased review based on my user experience.", "summary": "Excellent small PowerBank with carry pouch and charger", "unixReviewTime": 1454371200}
